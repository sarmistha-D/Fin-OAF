0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kw1VICCx4M,3kw1VICCx4M," An interesting letter from Blackwell Capital though, and I'm sure you've heard about this, to Peloton suggesting some of the companies that would be better stewards that should buy Peloton. They threw out Apple, Disney, Sony, Nike, a number of tech streaming metaverse and sportswear companies. Could they be purchased this year, and who would be a likely candidate? Great question. Could they? Doesn't everything could. I think the question is should they, and the question is when and why, right? Why hasn't it happened yet? And so if I think about it, one of those companies, right, if we just quickly go through those companies, one of them is Nike. We have found the athletic brands, Nike, Under Armour, Lulu, all bought Connected Fitness, and all of them have either walked away from it or written it down. I think we've talked about Lulu's mirror purchase has gone less than they hoped for. So I don't know that the athletic businesses want to get involved. Amazon is obviously already connected with the business. Amazon, on the other hand, is in the business of moving a lot of product. That's not brand enhancing. So to the question of if they believe the tan is large, but the brand can be eroded while doing it, then potentially, right? But what does Amazon get that they don't already have right now and now that they're already selling the product? So that's them. Apple, from a branding perspective, I guess makes sense. I think the question I've always wondered, and I don't cover Apple, has always been why wouldn't they have picked up this company earlier? Right, if we're talking about just order of magnitude where Apple was during COVID and where Peloton was during COVID, Peloton was up and to the right. Peloton had the eyeballs of everyone that they would have had. The engagement now has declined. The perception now has declined. So if you didn't buy before, are you looking now? Again, I don't know, but just throwing out the thought process that at least I would have when thinking about this. I think right now Peloton's doing an excellent job flipping their own problems, working on the restructuring, cutting fixed costs. And I think the question is, does that lead to growth or not? You can be a healthy brand. You can be a smaller brand. And the reality is right now, you're getting a lot of credibility from Wall Street at five and a half billion dollar market cap. It's worst things in the world.",Blackwell capital suggested buyers for the peloton and the buyers were analyzed based on their position on whether to buy or not and also peloton's potential growth was discussed. Growth is increased 27.53%.

First up, I want to take a look at Baidu because shares popping today after an SEC filing revealing the asset manager BlackRock has upped its passive stake in the company to 6.6% as of last quarter. That's up from about 5% stake a year ago. You're looking at gains of just about a 13%. And Dave, this news coming after we certainly have seen this rising interest in chat GPT in AI. Baidu has been named by Bloomberg earlier this week. There's a report out that they're planning to roll out a chat GPT like service next month, which is going to be huge here for the company. If in fact that is true. Yeah, Reuters says that is indeed true. Rolling it out by March, it'll be a standalone service and then fold it into their own search over time. The winner here as related to that could be Pindu Odua who finished the day up more than 5% largely on the heels of Baidu.","Baidu's shares rose by 13% after BlackRock increased its stake in the company to 6.6%, and it plans to roll out a chat GPT-like service next month, which could benefit the company and which will help the growth of pinduoduo.

2,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T18IoH4ECtw,T18IoH4ECtw," Thank you very much. That is your own pal wrapping up his first press conference of the year. Let's take a look at how the markets are reacting to this and still holding on to gains despite the fact that Fed Chair pal reiterated time and time again that more increases would be necessary in order to get inflation under control. You're looking at the Dow up 45 points, flipping back into positive territory during that press conference. S&P up just about 1%. The Nasdaq now up nearly 2%. Dave, in all this coming time and time again, Fed Chair Jay Powell saying that the risk here is just about doing too little rather than doing too much and saying that more increases are certainly necessary at this time. Largely speaking, very similar to prior speeches. Almost word for word, as he just reiterated there, they have taken COVID out. They no longer think it is a serious impact on the economy, both the exception of that and saying really making clear that they have to raise the debt ceiling. This is largely the same speech we have heard going back a couple of Fed meetings now. And look, this is an economic Rorschach test. The markets see what they want to see, and they see a butterfly in that speech. I think a lot of people might see a bat. I hear what you heard that it sounds in all likelihood, although he punted largely speaking, on keeping in the language of ongoing increase. He was asked twice to confirm if that meant multiple increases are still coming after this 25 point hike, which by the way is the eighth in the last year. He punted twice on saying whether or not there would be multiple coming. I don't know what to you is raising. Let's just look at the NASDAQ most sensitive to interest rates. What to you is justifying a 2% increase? I think that I think that he left the door open. He wasn't committal just in terms of how aggressive the Fed was going to get. And this is what like you were saying, certainly similar to what we've seen in the last couple of Fed decisions, the last couple of conferences. The markets hear what they want to hear and they hang on to any sort of optimism. And we're seeing that playing out in the markets again today. Some comments about the jobs market really stuck out to me just in terms of what exactly needs to happen. Pal saying that the labor market is still extremely tight. He was saying that there are some signs of improvement that labor cost report that we got out earlier this week. He called that quote constructive, but he did remain the fact that maybe we could see improvement in inflation, inflation easing without massive destruction here in the labor markets. And he's reiterated time and time again on the flip side of what you're seeing in the markets. This stands out to me. We will need substantially more evidence to begin cutting substantially more evidence. He added the risk to them and he has reiterated this for several meetings now. The risk to Jerome Powell is doing too little and he's been very clear they'd rather overdo it than underdo it when it comes to these increases. A lot of work left to do and we don't see disinflation in that services, ex housing sector. And that is why they will continue to hike and look, sounds to me, to one person like there are two more increases. But the markets don't hear that. The markets don't hear that. They don't want to hear that. Pal saying that the global picture is improving a bit. Inflation comes down sentiment, he says, is going to improve.","The Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell's press conference and its effects were discussed. Jerome Powell stated that covid is not an economic issue now and the interest rate should be increased to control inflation. Despite this statement the index's are holding to their gains. Despite Powell's emphasis on the need for more increases to control inflation, the markets are holding onto gains. The Dow is up by 45 points, the S&P is up by about 1%, and the Nasdaq is up by nearly 2%. The Federal Reserve has increased interest rates by 25 points, marking the eighth such increase in the last year. There is ambiguity about whether there will be further multiple increases."
3,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttJlbPchk5Q,ttJlbPchk5Q," I think from a contrarian basis, if you're looking for names that the market has hated, but maybe have a big theme around it, we love the communication services sector from a thematic perspective in terms of, we call it the three C's of communication services, cash, content, and consolidation. I think the streamers are gonna consolidate. Who could consolidate? Who could be the winner? Well, listen, you know, I like not, not like all other Americans. I've got like 10 streaming services. This is too much, right? So the winner and the one that we've stayed with all along and received a lot of negative press about it is Netflix. I think Netflix is the Kleenex of streaming, bottom line, period. Best run, cashflow, and now they're going to advertising. Fantastic. They will be the core, right? I think Disney is going to be part of the core. What happens to Peacock and Paramount Plus and all of these others, I think remains to be seen. And so I think that's kind of where you want to look with respect to potential consolidation, especially given the fact that the content is becoming much more expensive in the streams and how we're going to deliver that content. Netflix has got it right. So we got one.","The communication services sector is to watch from a thematic perspective, with a focus on cash, content, and consolidation. Netflix is seen as the Kleenex of streaming and likely to be a key player in the industry's consolidation, along with Disney. Fed funds rate at 2005 was 2..25%, 2006 was 5.25%, 2008 was 0 to 0.25%, 2021 was the same and in 2023 it increased to 4.75%. "
4,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5XFpJNbPYU,u5XFpJNbPYU," Jared, what are we seeing? Instantly they didn't like it and now coming back to Earth? Yeah, so it looks like a little green here, not a lot, but we'll take it. And actually the fireworks start in just a few minutes here, about 14 or so. So here's the NASDAQ and you can see here is the 2 p.m. announcement. Initially we went down, now we're back up. A lot of times there are zigzags, including when Chair Powell takes the lectern at 2.30. What matters today is not only the close today but also the close tomorrow. So you take yesterday's, that would be Tuesday's close, you compared it to tomorrow's close. If it's higher, well that is a successful FOMC announcement, not necessarily from the perspective of the Fed but from the average investor. Now let's take a look at the sector action, only tech in the forefront there. Notable because that has been a leading sector this year and one of the worst off last years. And that kind of speaks to that paradigm that we've had where the NASDAQ is leading this year, leading the Dow and it was the opposite last year, energy taking up the rear there. But let's check out what's going on in the bond market and not seeing a whole lot of movement here either. This is a 10 year Treasury note. Futures, basically where we were when we started the announcement. So I would expect that to pick up some steam when Powell takes some questions later on. And let's get to some other markets here, some other leading markets, especially in the futures. Let's take a look at gold. Gold really not moving. Now gold has been on a little bit of a tear so far. It's up five and a half percent year to date compared to where it's been over the last year, really regaining some of that lost territory. Copper futures, let me put this back to an intraday, not seeing a whole lot of movement from Dr. Copper right there. And we got to check out Bitcoin. Bitcoin, very telling. I've been saying you want to know where the stocks are going to close. Watch where Bitcoin is moving into that press conference. And it looks very squiggly right here. That's because this is a huge, this is a very small range for Bitcoin. Let me put a year to date chart here and you can just see what I'm talking about. It's pretty much flatlined over the last week to 10 days. So if Bitcoin starts moving up in a big way, it could be a leading indicator. Down the same way. Don't have much more than that. You know, we look into these statements and we look into the charts with quite the color die here, Dave. It's really hanging on though, Bitcoin. Really just. Above twenty three thousand, so above twenty thousand. Can't complain.","The speaker is giving updates on various markets, including the NASDAQ and bond market, during the FOMC announcement. Bitcoin's movement is being watched as a potential leading indicator. Tomorrow's close will be important to determine the success of the announcement. Fed raises rates by 25 BPS. Gold has increased by five and a half percent year-to-date, recovering lost territory from the previous year."
5,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YmoTISe0OM,7YmoTISe0OM," Good afternoon. Raidhike, the Federal Reserve, raising its benchmark policy rate by a quarter percentage point to a new range of four and a half to four and three quarters percent. That marks the highest level since October 2007. Now in their statement, Fed officials acknowledged that inflation has eased somewhat but remains elevated. They no longer noted, however, that the war in Ukraine is contributing upward pressure to inflation, rather just global uncertainty. Now they did maintain language in the statement that, quote, ongoing increases in rate hikes would be appropriate to obtain a, quote, sufficiently restrictive level on the Fed funds rate, perhaps in effect countering that recent easing in financial conditions. Now the Fed also noted that in terming, quote, the extent of future rate hikes instead of pace, which was formally used in the former statement, that the Fed will take into account lags in monetary policy and the impact on inflation, the economy and financial developments. Of course, this move marking a further slowdown from the 50 basis point rate hike we saw in December and a further slowdown from a string of 475 basis point rate hikes in June through November of last year, which was the most aggressive stretch since the 1980s. This decision was unanimous. We will get more from Fed Chair Powell when he holds its press conference in less than 30 minutes time. Back to you. All right, Jen, when we take a look at this, you mentioned the fact that ongoing rate increases, they remain appropriate. Inflation, though, has eased somewhat. We know a lot of the focus is going to be on Powell, what he says, the tone that he is using. What will you be looking to hear from Powell in just about 30 minutes from now? I expect Fed Chair Powell to take a very hawkish tone. He is going to remain committed to bringing down inflation to 2 percent while it has eased over the past three months. It still remains well above the Fed's 2 percent target. If you look at the Fed's preferred measure on inflation, that so-called core PCE clocked in around 4.4 percent in December, so still somewhat elevated there. So I expect him to talk tough on inflation and especially if financial conditions remain easy or ease further. I think that could give the license, the Fed license to continue raising at that point. And that's why I think you saw the Fed maintain language for ongoing increases, plural. All right, Jen Jemberger, thanks so much.",The federal reserve has raised its benchmark policy rate by a quarter percentage point to a new range of 4.5% to 4.75% and looking forward to increasing that to control inflation at two percent.
6,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaM9ngXUpQQ,WaM9ngXUpQQ," After decades of sales and over 200 billion dollars in revenue, America's best-selling drug is finally going generic. Injectable arthritis and autoimmune treatment, Humira, has lost its monopoly. So what does this mean for competitors and overall costs? Heavy finances Anjali Kemlani is following the story. Hi Anjali. Hi Rachelle. So as you mentioned, this is AbbVie's top-selling drug, Absolute Blockbuster, that treats rheumatoid arthritis specifically as well as some other diseases. And so what we're looking at is the drop-off of the exclusivity of that patent for AbbVie. And Amgen is coming on with its own biosimilar. There are also a number of others expected this year. Now this is not new. The part that we know is that these biosimilars have been ready to go. What AbbVie did really is extend its patent for this drug an additional six years from 2016 when it was supposed to lose exclusivity and when the biosimilars were supposed to get on. Now let me introduce you to AbbVie's Humira, and that is a drug that has, as you mentioned, 208 billion dollars since getting on the market in 2002, 114 billion since 2016 when it renewed that patent, and 20 billion dollars alone in 2022. So that's the market there that they are now competing with another treatment on the market with Amgen. Now Amgen is doing something really interesting, and that is pricing its biosimilar at two different levels, 5% and 55% off of Humira's price. Now why that's interesting is because, as we know, the US drug system relies heavily on PBMs and insurers to take up the control of who gets these drugs, how the formularies work, and what that means is that there's an incentive for the higher list price to be the one that's used. Now two insurers, Cigna and United Healthcare, have already kind of taken a stab at this by pointing to the fact that they're going to have both AbbVie's drug and the biosimilars on the same tier in the formulary, meaning that it's going to be the same out-of-pocket cost for patients. However, what actually ends up getting prescribed is going to be particularly interesting when we see what the individual's particular insurance plan is, what their out-of-pocket costs are going to be, etc. So really an interesting market and really just another look at the US drug system and the insurance system. So we'll have to see what the uptake ends up being, but as of right now, a very interesting case in what is going on with these biosimilars and what happens down the line later this year when six others reach the market. Indeed, and then you add to that, obviously, the Biden administration's push to lower some of these prescription costs. It'll be an interesting time for Biofarber this year. Great stuff. Anjali Kamlani, thank you so much.","Humira, America's bestselling drug has lost its monopoly in the market as its biosimilars are released and it has lost its patent exclusivity. The released biosimilar from Amgen and other six biosimilars going to release soon."
7,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GU1VL7uTuHE,GU1VL7uTuHE," Welcome to Yahoo Finance Live this Wednesday, February 1st. We are moments away from the Fed's decision on interest rates. Wall Street widely expecting a 25 basis point hike. Let's take a look at the markets here ahead of that decision. And we are looking at losses here with the major averages. You have the Dow off just around 296 points. NASDAQ under pressure off just about two-tenths of a percent. The S&P off nearly a half of a percent. Taking a look at the bond market. Yields edging lower just a bit here ahead of this decision. Off about six basis points to 347. Not drifting too far from that three and a half line where we had really been trending for about a month or so now. Taking a look at the sector action ahead of this decision. It's a bit of a mixed, well, all in the red except for technology. You're looking at Energy, the largest underperformer here, off just around two and a half percent. Technology though, Dave, barely holding on to gains. Yeah, and largely speaking, the big names are largely holding their breath ahead of this decision. Not a whole lot of movement to the up or the downside. And you can see the names today, but really the story has been how they performed this year. The NASDAQ outperforming the S&P and the Dow after it was battered last year. And a lot of these big names up, huge. Tesla up 40% year to date. Apple's up about 10. Google's up about 11%. Meta, we are awaiting earnings for them. We'll get them after the break. We'll have full analysis of Meta earnings up almost a quarter year to date. It's been an outstanding start. Amazon up 22%. Jen Schomburger now with the Fed has the decision, I believe. Is she not quite ready yet? Not quite ready yet. Do you expect this to continue as largely the question? That is a huge question here. And we talked to one of our markets guest yesterday who was saying he doesn't necessarily see this as being a shift in sentiment. He sees this as a brief rally and he expects some of these leaders to then retreat.","The markets are down ahead of the Fed's decision on interest rates, with the Dow off 296 points and the NASDAQ slightly lower. Technology is the only sector in the green, while energy is the biggest underperformer. Big tech names have had a strong start to the year with Tesla up 40%, Apple up 10%, Google up 11%, and Amazon up 22, Amazon's 22 percent uptick, and Meta's nearly 25 percent growth, with discussions revolving around uncertain market sentiment and potential leader retractions..

8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aq1OiLvL07M,aq1OiLvL07M," Reports this week have shown the US housing slump stretched into a fifth month as home prices abroad slide lower domestically as well as abroad. Despite rising interest rates, it is now a good time to invest in real estate. Here to weigh in on that and the outlook for real estate investments is Principal Asset Management's Global Head of Research and Portfolio Strategy Indranil Kharlachar. Thank you for joining me Indy. So I want to ask you, a lot of people, there's a lot of noise out there and a lot of signals to watch. How are you sorting through this and determining what we should be paying attention to when trying to invest in this space? Yeah, good morning, Rachel. As you said, there's a lot of noise out in the market and we believe that noise will continue for the foreseeable future. And the rationale is pretty simple, really, if you think about what's happening in the US economy, we're seeing two forces at work. One is inflation and the other is the Federal Reserve working hard to push that inflation level down. And so what we are telling investors is really focus on those two signals very, very clearly because the direction of inflation will really determine the direction of the Fed's actions. And unfortunately, it seems that until the Fed, please from our perspective, the Fed is likely to keep stay resolute in its wording and its language until it sees very clear signs that inflation is on the way down or feels comfortable that inflation is where it needs to be. And until that happens, we think the capital markets and real estate markets, for that matter, are going to remain somewhat volatile, somewhat turbulent. So what we are recommending investors is really stay focused on cash flows that are resilient, that can withstand this period of turbulence that we expect over the next six to 12 months, but also be prepared to pivot to opportunities because when there's dislocation, there's also opportunity. So it's really building a resilient and nimble portfolio in real estate that focuses on the full array of opportunities that is available to a real estate investor, including, of course, including, of course, the residential sector, but also be prepared to invest more opportunistically, more nimbly in the in the public quarters of real estate, for example, REITs, when they dislocate, they might offer some interesting opportunities. So big picture we're telling investors is be defensive, recognizing that we're going to enter a period of uncertainty, potential recession, but be prepared to be nimble and pivot when the opportunities do arise. So then looking within REITs, then what are some of the key themes to keep an eye on when really determining when to enter the market and how to enter it? Yeah, that's the million dollar question, Rachelle. I think when we look at REITs, we look at it more holistically from the perspective of a real estate owner. And ultimately, REITs do offer a different form of ownership to commercial real estate, albeit in the public side. And so we look for similar things, underlying REITs. How is their earnings? What's the cash flow opportunity? How resilient are these cash flows? So when we're looking at the opportunity for REITs in REITs, we are looking at which REIT stocks are more resilient in terms of cash flows, which REIT stocks are able to generate stronger earnings despite the potential uncertainty. So when we're looking at REITs, we're looking at these two underlying drivers. But more importantly, we're also looking at when the timing may occur, when the timing may become more favorable in terms of the, quote unquote, Fed pivot, the great Fed pivot. Now, the challenge is, of course, it's very hard to precisely determine when the Fed does stop its interest rate tightening cycle. But we believe that time will come when it feels that the inflation outlook has improved materially. And when that timing does occur, the REIT market, the US listed REIT market, will become a really interesting spot to play. And so we're looking for a couple of things. Looking for the earnings outlook. We're looking for REITs that throw off structurally resilient cash flows. And of course, we're looking for when there are clear signs that the Fed has done, at least for the time being, with its interest rate tightening policies. And how are you seeing some of these investment strategies differ depending on age demographic? That's a great question. You know, we believe that the US, like any other developed market, is going through a profound change in its demographic outlook. We're aging as a society. We're getting greyer. And that's leading to a whole host of different opportunities, particularly in demographically driven real estate strategies. So I'll pick on a couple of, for example, if you look at the residential market in the US, it's a vast market. But for right or wrong reasons, people have typically or investors analysts have typically focused on this owner occupied residential sector. We think if you step out of the owner occupied residential sector, there are significant opportunities up and down the demographic scale to invest in it, whether it's single family rentals, whether it's manufactured homes, whether it's age restricted housing, whether it's senior living, whether it's assisted living or it's care living. There's a whole gamut of demographic related opportunities to to invest in the US residential sector. It's not only about single family owner occupied homes. And that's just one example of how you can play the demographic shift that's occurring in the US. But there's also other ways of playing the demographics shifts in the US. And the other is through, for example, the retail market, the retail patterns are changing. Ten years ago, e-commerce as a percentage of retail sales was growing, but it was pretty small. You look fast forward now, e-commerce is about 15, 16, 17 percent of retail sales. And a lot of that is being driven by the shift in the US demographics and the millennials, the generation Z, the younger generation, much more liable to to purchase and use e-commerce on their smartphones, on their tablets. And that's changing the way the US retail industry is evolving. Bricks and mortars has always been important for retailers, but so is clicks and mortars. It's become really important to have that holistic experience for retailers. So that's another example of how the shifting demographics in the US is actually shifting the way we shop. And that opens up opportunities as a real estate investor should be invested only in bricks and mortars or should you also invest in companies that give you clicks and mortars? That's fascinating. I love that clicks and mortars. Definitely not something we had talked about. There's so much focus on those single family homes, not as much focus on demographics. Great stuff there. Principal global head of research and portfolio strategies. Indranil Kharlachar, thank you so much.","Principal Asset Management's Global Head of Research and Portfolio Strategy, Indranil Kharlachar, suggests that investors should focus on resilient cash flows in real estate investments due to the uncertain and volatile market conditions caused by inflation and the Federal Reserve's actions. He also highlights the opportunities presented by demographic shifts in the market, such as investing in single family rentals and e-commerce."
9,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EG_qK2MAmI,_EG_qK2MAmI," Snap in focus this morning after reporting mixed earnings. According to its CEO, the flat year of the year growth reflected the rapid deceleration in the company's digital ad growth. Joining us now to break it down is Mark Mahaney, Evercore ISI Senior Managing Director, Head of Internet Research. Good to have you join us this morning, Mark. And we know obviously ad spend front and center for a lot of investors at the moment. In terms of this wider tightening on ad spending, how much of the issues when it comes to Snap? Or Snap specific? Okay, that's the right question, Rachelle. But there's clearly a lot of, there's clearly softening in overall advertising spend, whether it's offline or online. And it's that pace of softening seems to have accelerated. You know, Microsoft talked about that too on their earnings call in the account for about 10, 11 billion in ad revenue. So that was a very chunky data point. And their guidance implied acceleration in that deceleration or accelerating decline, accelerating deceleration in the growth rate. So softening is continuing into the March quarter. That's exactly what we heard from Snap last night. So there's a lot of stuff here that's macro, but there are things that are also Snap specific. This company is trying to do a redo of some of its ad platforms to counter the impact on its advertising efficacy from the Apple privacy changes. There's also a lot of competitive risk that Snap's facing. So there's a lot of things that are happening here. Daily average users, that growth is starting to slow down a little bit. So that could be the impact, ongoing impact from TikTok and maybe YouTube shorts. So the answer to your question is it's both. There's macro and then there's company specific factors. And as we look at some of those changes, especially with its direct response business, when it comes to ads, I mean, that's really been a lot of bread and butter for Snap here. How is it going to really maintain its competitive edge here? As when they come up, is it an immediate call to action to buy something or sign up for something? And that's really been the power alley of internet advertising, direct response advertising. There's some channels on the internet that are good for brand advertising. Netflix is building out one. But generally, the bread and butter, the power alley for internet advertising has been direct response advertising because historically it's been so well, it's been so measurable. And you could, you know, in real time adjust campaigns. So it's a wonderful efficiency associated with it. Some of that was undermined by the Apple privacy changes, but some but a lot that's still intact. The issue for Snap is that there are other companies that do this. There's two in particular that are really large in this space. One's called Google and one's called Meta or Facebook, Instagram. And so Snap's always had this problem like some of the other platforms like Pinterest and historically They're not a primary ad buy. They're a secondary or maybe even a tertiary ad buy. And if you're going into an advertising recession, what you're going to see is a lot of marketers consolidate that spend to just the one or two platforms. In good times, you diversify your spend. In bad times, you concentrate it. So it just kind of adds to the pressure on Snap's fundamentals today. And that's why they're likely to show a year of your decline in ad revenue in the March quarter. And we did see some downgrades, including from UBS today. But you've kept an inline rating here and also have a price target. Lower your price target from $14 to $12. Talk about why you have still this inline rating for them. Well, this stock's trading at around three times. EB to sales, enterprise value to sales. That's sort of the trough level it's been at. And so what you have to ask yourself as an investor is do you think things are going to get materially worse? Multiple will go down if fundamentals get materially worse. They are correlated. I'm not, our sense is that we're going to see kind of a macro recovery in online ad spend later in 23. And I think that a lot of the changes that are going on now at Snap that are near term undermining their direct response advertising, but I think can long term help those trends. I think they're doing, they're retraining their algorithms and using artificial intelligence, too. Kind of like what Meta is doing. Except that Meta's just got so many more resources and started doing this more aggressively, probably six or nine months ago. So they're ahead of the curve, whereas Snap's behind the curve. But there is a curve. And so on the other side of that curve, didn't ruin the analogy. I think you could see Snap's fundamentals recover. So that's why I kind of want to stick to the sidelines on it. I don't think it's a sell here, but it's not a buy either. I think you've at least got a couple of quarters before you could consider being constructive on the name. And in terms of what you liked in the earnings report, what else stood out to you? Frankly, not much. This was mostly a negative report. But there is this new asset, somewhat newer asset, it's called Spotlight. So for all the Snap users out there, they know what I'm talking about. There's a it's kind of like their TikTok offering. So if you're on the screen far right and you get a lot of short form video and know can be highly entertaining, addictive like most short form video platforms, TikTok, Reels, YouTube shorts. But it's a nice integration. And this is one of those, you know, you look for those opportunities that companies have assets that they under monetize because it's a new revenue growth opportunity. Spotlight is one of those. They have very little ads, very little ad intensity in there. But there's no reason why over time they can't better monetize that. So I think that's kind of one nice little area. Then Snapchat also has a subscription service that I think has got about two million users. I don't know how big that gets, but you know, it's a nice diversification of the business model a little bit away from advertising. I think those are two kind of modest positives you could have seen through in all the gloom last night. And as you mentioned, Meta and Google, obviously with Instagram Reels and the YouTube shorts here, how does how does how does Snap then position itself in that conversation when you already do have these heavy hitters? What room does that leave in terms of a competitive competitive edge for Snap? Well, Rochelle, you're asking a good question. It's arguably it's a very bearish question, which is what's really special about Snap. What is special about Snap is this demographic hold that they have. And it's something like 70 percent of 13 to 24 year olds in a couple of dozen countries are on Snap. So it's very popular with younger users, not primarily for messaging. I've got a bunch of teenagers at home and they use Snap and that's how they communicate. They don't they don't text like you and I do, Rochelle, or maybe email. They they chat with each other. So there's a there's a very strong demographic appeal. And so for marketers that want to pitch products to that particular demographic, Snap gives you that. And they've got pretty good reach. They've got well over 300 million, 300 million daily average users, not monthly, but daily. So they have a very engaged, very tightly defined demographic. So for some marketers that I think they they could be a very attractive end market. And also I want to give Snap credit. They've been generally very good at product innovation over the years. So I think that's one of the reasons why they get a very strong, very, very good positioning with this demographic. And they still have one of the best user growth profiles out there amongst the social media assets.","After snap's report, their position is analyzed by Mark Mahaney as in what are the positive and negative things to look into the report.Snap reported mixed earnings with flat YoY growth due to a rapid deceleration in digital ad growth, affected by Apple's privacy changes and increased competition from Google and Facebook. Despite some positives such as the newer asset Spotlight and a subscription service, Evercore ISI's Mark Mahaney gives an inline rating and loweredthe  price target from $14 to $12, stating that Snap's demographic appeal to younger users and strong product innovation may attract some marketers, but its position as a primary ad buy is challenged in the current advertising recession.The company's demographic appeal among 13 to 24-year-olds is its standout feature, and despite challenges, Snap's strong engagement and innovation could play in its favor.

10,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtFIW7_VUwE,dtFIW7_VUwE," Well, the first FOMC meeting of the year is upon us and investors will soon find out the Fed's rate hike decision with expectations set for a rate hike of 25 basis points. However, the lines are blurred when it comes to pinpointing where the Fed lies between dovishness and hawkishness. Here to paint the picture is Yahoo Finance's Ines Farah. Hey, Ines. Hey, Rachelle. That's right. And the Federal Reserve will have this mission, which is to basically convey to the markets that they will be keeping rates higher for longer. 25 basis point rate hike. That's what the market is expecting today. But that will be a slowdown from the more aggressive rate hikes in 2022. Now, the markets this month have rallied and some strategists are pointing to the fact that investors are thinking, well, the Fed is going to pivot because inflation is cooling. You've got the labor market that's cooling someone. So the Fed by raising by 25 basis points, that will be a slowdown just anticipating a pivot. The Fed doesn't want that because that means that the asset asset prices go up and that means that demand keeps going up. The Fed wants to bring down asset prices, wants to cool the labor market, wants to cool wages in order to bring down demand, in order to bring down inflation. So some strategists have been chiming in economists. We have Ellen Zetner, chief economist from Morgan Stanley. These are her comments saying where there is a market disconnect is that the Fed keeps saying over and over again, and these are the doves and hawks alike, that the policy rate is likely to stay at peak for quite some time. Michael Gape and chief economist from Bank of America saying if the Fed is slowing down to a pace of 25 basis points, it's hard to push back too strongly, hard to be hawkish and strong when you just slow down again. And investor Jeff Gunlach saying, I suspect Fed messaging will push back against the pivot narrative and thereby current bond market pricing should be interesting. And finally, just want to point out macro alpha Alfonso Picachello. He has been on with Jared Blickery on Uncut. He says, Powell will try to convince markets of hire for longer and probably calm down animal spirits, a hard job. Basically, the Fed doesn't want the markets to rally because otherwise that does make their job harder. Rochelle? We'll have to see if investors believe that even as we continue to see them slow down the race of the race of paid hikes, whether that's actually going to end up meaning that the Fed is going to have to at some point make a more dovish move here. Great stuff there, Ines Ferre.","The first FOMC meeting is close to the video timings and they are likely to increase the interest rates to control inflation. The Fed is expected to raise rates by 25 basis points, but there are concerns about a market disconnect and the need to convey the message that they will be keeping rates higher for longer to bring down inflation. Some strategists believe the Fed will push back against the notion of a pivot and try to calm down the markets."
11,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2znip38h8DI,2znip38h8DI," Investor expectations are set for the Fed to trim the size of its rate hike again, as the narrative for a pivot remains unclear and recession concerns linger. But what does this spell out for the year ahead? Here to discuss is Dana Dioria, Investnet Co-Chief Investment Officer. Good to see you, Dana. So, a lot of optimism priced in here at the moment. They'll be looking at that basis point hike, but wondering, should we really believe the hawkish tone of Fed SharePAL given this movement? What's your take on how investors are really reacting right now? Yeah, it's amazing. It's actually so interesting because, you know, don't fight the Fed, right? But the market is absolutely sending a different signal. The market is absorbing the economic data that we've seen come in. There's absolutely an expectation of a pivot and, you know, a lower terminal rate and, you know, not only just this year, but even more so as we move into next year. Meantime, the Fed keeps telling us, you know, no, expect a higher terminal rate, five or above. And, you know, we're going to hold or hike and hold, right? So even when we're not actually hiking rates, we'll be holding it for a while. So, I mean, the question, of course, becomes, you know, how do you as an investor sort of react to this? And I think, you know, some of it is yet to be determined, right? We'll see economic news that may or may not impact the Fed. But net-net, I think, assuming that the Fed will pivot earlier than what they're saying is a riskier kind of a bet. I think it stems from years of having the Fed kind of step in. And that was years, you've got to remember, of inflation not being what it is today. I think Powell has to stay on message. There are things he could say. I think if he was, you know, more dovish than folks expected, that would really, you know, that would surprise the markets, right? But I don't expect that at all. I expect actually that he's going to stay on message. And even if, you know, there is the thought of, hey, you know, depending on where the data goes, maybe we do ease off a little bit more quickly than expected. He's not going to say that today to the markets at all. I mean, we have sticky wage increases. We have earnings expectations being put into the market now, right? You know, declines in earning expectations, you know, and that's happening kind of slowly, right? As companies come out, analysts are slowly sort of downgrading expectations related to things like operating margins. You know, companies not able to necessarily pass on greater price increases at the rate that they were facing in terms of wage inflation, et cetera. So all of that has to work into the market. But I don't expect any unexpected news from Powell today. So then as we look at things as they work their way through the market, as we look at the Fed's medicine still waiting to take hold in the broader economy, then what does that mean in terms of how you allocate your assets, your assets in this period? Yeah, look, you know, a few big takeaways. One, and you're hearing this, I think, a lot of places, but if you're not globally diversified, if you've had this mantra in your head about the last 10 years, you know, US outperforming. And why do I need, you know, international stocks? I think we actually just recently had, you know, with the with the mild winter that Europe is experiencing and the change from expectation of a pretty hefty recession in Europe to now. Hey, they might avoid recession altogether. It really kind of tells you something about markets in general about, you know, the value of prognostication at that level. If you're not globally diversified, you really should be thinking about that. Markets are cyclical. 10 years of US outperformance. Yes. But what happened in the last decade? It was 10 years of earning nothing in the S&P 500. But if you were internationally diversified, you had return coming to you. And obviously a lot of focus on the Fed. But what are some of the risks that investors also need to be paying attention to? You mentioned international markets. You have China reopening. You have the debt ceiling. What are some of the biggest risks you think that investors should be paying more attention to right now? Yeah, I think we have, you know, the market has short term risks and they have long term risks, you know, short term risks, the debt ceiling debacle. It's just painful that we have to continually go through this. You know, I think the US and Denmark are the only two countries that have this sort of a system where we can we spend the money, right? The debt ceiling debate is about paying the bills that we've already created. It's not about future spending. But, you know, we do this to ourselves, right? Where we where we have to now play fast and loose with whether we're going to pay the bill or not. So that's going to royal markets. And depending on how much brinksmanship, I mean, we saw what happened, you know, in 2011 and it was pretty painful on markets. So I think that's a risk short term. You mentioned it. China reopening, where that goes, you know, the bad economic data coming in markets, repricing on earnings, etc. Earnings not probably going to be what, you know, even they're forecasted. Now we've got more repricing to go long term. You know, you were pricing in more structural differences. Are we going to get back to inflation at two percent or are we going to be living in a world a little bit higher inflation for longer? Three percent, maybe, etc. You know, those are longer term risks. And that leads you to say, hey, you know, P multiples may not be what they were in the past. The expected return on stocks may not be what it has been. And what would you think we'll get to some sort of sense of normalcy? Obviously, it's still macroeconomic pressure, still weighing on earnings, keeping an eye on margins. At what point do you think we'll see perhaps a leveling off of some of this volatility? Yeah, it's an interesting question because like what is normal, you know, at this point, so much change in the last few years. You know, we've gone from a world where tech is kind of defensive to back to growth being more risky because, you know, there's cost to money. I would say in terms of normalcy from the Fed, we are getting there. You know, the highlight I would say is last year we had so much volatility in terms of just these very abrupt and very high increases. Now, at least we kind of have we're kind of in a place where the data is coming in, where we expect it to write inflation is coming in, where we expect it to. We're seeing a rolling over. So I do think that markets will benefit if not by a Fed pivot by some understanding of what the Fed's going to do, not as much volatility and what that rate is going to be. And I do think to a certain extent that is its own return to normalcy. And as we await a pivot, whenever that does end up happening, obviously, we still have to have a pause before we even get to the pivoting point. Then how should people start looking at their portfolios trying to plan for the future right now? Yeah, well, so in addition to, you know, kind of that whole global diversification, we do get asked about, you know, should fixed income be part of the portfolio or in the same, you know, amounts that it that it was. And I would say planning ahead, you're you do want to think about what your fixed income position is in the portfolio. You've already experienced a lot of the pain, right? So watching the AG drop 13 percent double digits in the same year that the S&P drops 18 percent, very painful and raises questions about, you know, the traditional 60 40. But on the other hand, how much more pain do we really expect? Even if the Fed goes as high as it says it is and the market has to reprice a little, that's nothing like what we experienced last year. So I would say, you know, just dealing with advisors and retail clients, looking at how much ballast you have in the portfolio, whether you expect a pivot and great markets ahead or not, making sure you're paying attention that clients risk tolerance and say, you know, do I have the right ballast? Do I have safer assets in there at the rate at the allocation that they need to be? So we have to take a closer look at portfolios right now. A big thank you there to Dana DiOrea, Investnet Co-Chief Investment Officer. Thank you so much.","Investors anticipate the Fed to pivot earlier than expected, but the Fed is expected to stay consistent, causing investors to consider asset allocation and global diversification. Risks include the debt ceiling, China reopening, and long-term structural differences. Investors should review their portfolios and ensure appropriate allocation and safer assets."
12,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koMhmrWeVPc,koMhmrWeVPc," Ritz crackers, Philadelphia cream cheese, Oreos. A few of my favorite products made by Mondaleez. You can see shares popping a bit after hours after reporting their fourth quarter earnings beat. Yahoo Finance's Brooke DePalma here to break down the numbers. You've got to love Ritz crackers. If you don't, we're not friends. Oh, we are certainly friends, Dave, because I love Ritz crackers, and it turns out investors do too. Oreo maker Mondaleez certainly beating on both the top and bottom line here as consumers look to their favorite chocolate treats and perhaps those Ritz crackers during inflation. As you can see here, they posted a beat revenue coming in at 8.7 billion. Adjusted earnings per share coming in at 73 cents, both higher than Wall Street's expectations, largely driven by pricing and volume. CEO saying that on the release today, as I noted before, consumers are hammered by their spending power, but they are still flocking to those known brands like Oreos, their favorite here. In addition to that, taking a closer look at full year revenue here, jumping across all markets. Latin America up nearly 30 percent, Asia, Middle East, and Africa up nearly 5 percent, Europe up 2.4 percent, North America up 16.6 percent. CEO noting that these results were underscored by the strength in emerging markets, largely Latin America there. In addition to that, they also did note that drivers of this past year, as well as the fourth quarter results, were based upon acquisitions of Clif Bar, among other acquisitions, but they were offset by unfavorable currency that impacted across the board in 2022. In addition to that, they did note that they announced an agreement with Profetti von Mali to acquire our developed markets gum business. So of course, they are the makers behind Trident and Stride. Those gum businesses are in U.S., Canada, and Europe. That deal expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2023. Another announcement made on this earnings release is a $6 billion share buyback program that's expected to go through December of 2025. So lots to unpack as investors and, you know, Main Street certainly look to this company for a sweet relief, I guess you could say. Taube-Lorone! Legendary airport purchase, the Taube-Lorone. Cadbury's pretty good too. Alright, what are analysts looking for on the call? What do they want to hear? Yeah, well I really think they do want to understand how exactly the consumer is responding during this time, largely looking at Easter is around the corner for that Cadbury purchases, perhaps, you know, are they responding to a higher price? Are they still going to flock to those favorite treats, especially upon the Easter season? I think in addition to that, they definitely want to hear more on just the impact that we're seeing overseas as in Europe continues to work through those high inflationary pressures as we heard from other executives like McDonald's today on the call. In addition to that, as we spoke to Mondalis last year, and I believe it was 2021, Ukraine continues to be a major business for them, so perhaps analysts hoping to hear more on that front as well. Huge number in Latin America, about 30% revenues. Brooke DePalma, thanks so much, good to see you my friend.","Mondalez surpasses Q4 earnings estimates with $8.7 billion revenue and 73 cents adjusted earnings per share, led by pricing, volume, and success in emerging markets. They plan to buy back $6 billion in shares and acquire Profetti von Mali's developed market gum business. Full-year revenue saw significant growth in various markets, including Latin America (up nearly 30%), Asia Middle East and Africa (up nearly 5%), and North America (up 16.6%). The company also announced a six billion share buyback program, and analysts are interested in consumer response and overseas performance, particularly in Europe's high inflation environment."

You can see 4.6% gain on the day. UPS projecting full year revenue for 2023 between 97 and 99 billion, 0.4 billion, just shy of the street's estimates. UPS CFO Brian Newman saying on Thursday's earnings call, quote, we expect 2023 to be a bumpy year. Headwinds that will impact the business, including record high inflation, recession fears, a war in Eastern Europe, COVID disruptions in China and U.S. labor negotiations. Still, shares of UPS edging higher today as the company projects some of those concerns to subside in the second half of the year. So again, just reiterating, they see a recession first half, a recovery in the economy and in their business in the second half. Yeah, you got to look at this package volume. It's a little bit concerning when you take a look at the broader economy, what that could signal at least for the coming quarters. We know that the holiday period is so important for UPS, so important for its rival FedEx. And when you see that package volume drop, coming up a bit short rather, I should say consumers really pulling back on their spending. What exactly the signals here for the next quarter or two could be something to really keep an eye on. And then also labor negotiations. We know that's going to be front and center for UPS over the next couple of quarters. Those negotiations are expected to start in April. Of course, how that pans out could have real implications for UPS. Yeah, some feel this will be the most contentious labor talks they've had since the strike in 1997. They're dealing with the teamsters. This is going to be a real tough road and it's going to cost them a pretty penny. They did increase shipping prices 6.9%. That's on top of the 5.9 the prior year and 4.9 prior to that. So not a great story in terms of inflation coming down because they are continuing to increase prices there at UPS. Yeah, they certainly are. When you take a look at that price increase, it's also going to be a question of whether or not consumers are willing to spend how much they will be shipping, whether or not that of course is going to impact their behavior down the line. Certainly something to watch.","UPS stock rose despite missing revenue estimates by $1 billion.

14,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoG7bx3Czb0,JoG7bx3Czb0," Alright, let's get you up to speed with McDonald's. Another big mover here. The company reporting better than expected earnings yet we're looking at the stock off just about one and a half percent. The beat coming after McDonald's raises prices by about 10 percent in its previous quarter to combat those higher operating costs that we've been hearing about. Now to put the prices in perspective, we took a look at some of their most popular items. You have the Big Mac, fries and the McChicken. So this is comparing to prices back in 2019, about three years ago. The Big Mac price is up seven percent. Fries have jumped nearly 25 percent. The McChicken up nearly 28 percent. Despite these price hikes, Dave, it looks like when you take a look at some of the traffic inside their stores, consumers are trading down to McDonald's and willing to spend there. Look, when I look at this report, I'm shocked at the investor reaction across the board. They do say their prices, to your point, up 10 percent on average from a year earlier. But dive inside these numbers. U.S. visits up 26 percent. That's from pre-pandemic, from 2019 levels. They're up 30 percent from a year ago. And if you want one more thing, how about an operating margin of 45 percent? That was 40 a year ago. They have raised prices. Consumers continue to pay it. And we have seen in the past, McDonald's has proven to be recession resistant. I think it's a pretty stellar report. It is a stellar report. And also when you look inside and see what is working for McDonald's, yes, they're able to raise prices. Yes, consumers are continuing to spend. But some of their initiatives, we talked about the McRib. That clearly was a huge hit from McDonald's. You ever had it? I've never had it, have you? Oh, yeah. Do you like it? You have. You've had a McRib and not a Big Mac? I have had several McRibs in my life. The texture bothers me now. Does it live up to the hype? As a young kid, the texture will freak you out. Yeah. And I can't do it anymore. But as a young kid, I loved it. Still never had a Big Mac, though. Yeah, that blows my mind. Their fries are my favorite. McDonald's fries are my favorite, but they're not yours? No, no, not not close Wendy's. But no, I actually wanted to mention something in the report caught my eye. Difficult decisions coming when it comes to corporate staffing levels. Sounds like layoffs are ahead, although they are opening new stores in 2023. A lot to digest, like always with McDonald's.","McDonald's beats earnings forecast despite a 10% price hike, but stock declines. US visits increase, operating margin improves to 45%.

Over the past three years, the price of a Big Mac has increased by 7 percent, fries by nearly 25 percent, and the McChicken by almost 28 percent.

16,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYY-4FvDzXk,vYY-4FvDzXk," Well, investors may be warily watching the Fed's balancing act between its fight against inflation and the threat of recession. Now, the uncertainty leading some analysts to consider ETFs this year for investing. Here with more Ben Slavin, BNY Mail and Global Head of ETFs. Good to see you, Ben. Obviously, investors have a lot to take on at the moment. You have obviously that Fed uncertainty, this holding pattern that we're in at the moment. What are some of the top questions that clients who are interested in ETFs really have for you right now? Well, certainly investors are watching the Fed, but we see ETFs off to a strong start here in 2023. But what the data shows really is to some degree a lack of conviction. We've seen it really flow across the board. And what's interesting to note is with all the investor choice that's available in the ETF market, we see investors looking at actively managed ETFs here in January, both in fixed income and equity as a way to potentially play this market and potentially get some advice. And Ben, I want to talk about some of these inflows. We're seeing 610 billion inflows into ETFs last year. You're predicting a record one trillion dollars this year. What is going to get it there? Well, look, we've seen an acceleration of ETF flow into the market investors just simply choosing ETFs as a preferred way to invest really at the expense of mutual funds. And we saw that trend play out last year and the gap between outflows coming out of mutual funds into ETFs has grown really to the widest gap ever. And that swing was about 1.5 trillion this year. This year, again, we're off to a strong start and we see more issuers coming to market with new products. So it's not just passively managed product. It's certainly active. And now that the investor preference seems to be accelerating here at BNY Mellon, we're seeing really a large queue of clients lining up either to enter the ETF market or to bring new products to market. And we think that trend will continue here. And I think we could really be within reach of getting to that one trillion dollar mark this year. So Ben, in terms of standouts, specific ETFs that have offered the best returns over this period as we get ready to get into more traditional quarter point rate heights from the Fed. Well, you know, certainly we've seen investor interest in international equities, which is not something I've been saying much the last couple of years. And if you look at the top of the leaderboard, you see European equities at the top of the leaderboard gathering flow. And certainly they've performed well with investor sentiment thinking like dollar may have peaked and certainly valuation seeming attractive. And we started to see a run up there really in the European equities. Also, fixed income is continuing to catch a bid from investors. But what's interesting about that fixed income flow is we're seeing it really across the board. It's high yield, it's investment grade, it's short duration, it's long duration. And we're even seeing sort of the mortgage side of the market also pick up investor interest, really, again, trying to position around expectations around what the Fed may or may not do. Obviously, a lot of options out there, as you mentioned that you have the equity ETFs, fixed income, you also have the dividend ETFs as well for people who are trying to position themselves right now. What sort of allocation should they be looking at? Well, you know, certainly last year, what we have seen was a real sort of wake up call. Those who were invested in a traditional 60 40 type allocation had a really rough go of it, really a historic rough go of it. So what we've seen really is a lot of repositioning by investors looking at those allocations, harvesting tax losses in many cases, and using that opportunity to take a look at other possibilities in their portfolio, specifically to lower cost reposition tactically, and certainly adjust their fixed income allocations, you know, after the large route in the bond market last year. And so, again, we've seen a really historic volume in ETFs that was in place last year. We've seen again a strong start here to January and again a lot of repositioning. So the advice to investors is really to look at this opportunity to readjust, reallocate your portfolio and take a look at the new options that are out there, whether it be again to offer a new slice of your portfolio with some exposure. You didn't have before lower fees and again, harvest your taxes as well. If there are losses inherent in your your allocation. Certainly, at least something that we don't want to jump with both feet into the market right now with all this uncertainty ETFs, a great option there. Ben Slaven, their BNY Mellon Global head of ETFs. Thank you for joining me this morning.","The ETF market is expected to reach a record $1 trillion in 2023.

This comes after its board found evidence supporting claims of harassment and the suppression of worker unions. Yahoo! Finances' Ali Garfinkel has the latest. Ali, another development for unions here. Another development for unions here, definitely, Rachelle. This is actually kind of a different sort of labor story we have coming out of Apple. The NLRB here has essentially ruled that Apple's policies as they currently exist are violating workers' rights. Now, what does this mean? So what the NLRB is basically saying is that Apple's higher-ups and their imposition of strict confidentiality rules are what violate and limit collective action, that they're even coercive. Now, what is this really all about here? It's really all about how Apple is paranoid about employees leaking information is what we're getting. At the center of this all is a whistleblower who's in the midst of a lawsuit with Apple. Her name is Ashley Jovic, and she used to be a senior engineer program manager at Apple. As part of her case, she submitted a number of documents, including a rather newsworthy email from Tim Cook. The email basically says to workers, hey, here's the deal. We don't want you linking. We are actually looking for places where you are leaking. So there's been no comment from Jovic or Apple so far. However, based on the complaint and the ruling, it seems like they're also on the hunt to and fire anyone who's leaking confidential information. You see it here from this 2021 email that Jovic leaked. We know that leakers constitute a small number of people. We know that people who leak confidential information do not belong here. Apple has been the good guy in the tech unionization story so far in certain ways, especially because they've been the first to come to the table with workers in their Taosan Maryland store. However, this also comes after the NLRB's December ruling that Apple illegally interfered with elections in both New York and Atlanta. So where does this all leave us? In the end, I think this is important to remember that the NLRB has no ability whatsoever to impose punitive damages. However, this does also show that the NLRB is really not letting this go. And it also, I think, gives credence to the claim that Apple is surveilling its employees right on the edge of legality. And sometimes it appears they're crossing the line. We'll certainly be following in that story. Interesting to see how that plays out. As you mentioned, they're given Apple's appearance, at least, of being the first to come to the table when it comes to these unionization pushes. Great stuff there, Ali Garfinkel. Thank you so much.","Earnings season is in full swing with winners such as Spotify (+10%) and Exxon Mobil (record profit), and losers such as McDonald's (-2.5%). AMD's earnings report is awaited with a potential 19% move after the bell."
18,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7vgR4w0e7k,_7vgR4w0e7k," All right, well, earnings season is in full swing as investors digest the flood of quarterly reports. We have Yahoo! Finances Jared Blickery here to highlight some of the day's victories and losses along with some key earnings to watch this week. Hey, Jared. That's right. Let's get to it. We got some winners and some losers. This is our earnings heat map. Oh, let me get to this. This is our earnings heat map of what's happened today. Now, let's start with Spotify. This stock is up about 10%. Let me just show you on a one-year basis what it's done. Now we can go through some of the numbers. This is the highest price that we've seen in Spotify since September, and that's after beating expectations on the key metric of premium subscriber gains. And you can count 10 million of those people in the fourth quarter. Now, leading Bloomberg Intelligence to suggest that, quote, guidance for two million additions in the first quarter may be conservative, so maybe some upside there. Also gross margin catching the eye of Citigroup. They rated it with a buy with a price target of $140. They're saying that they should elevate the stock along with the monthly active users beat. And this is because the biggest concerns, or this is in spite of some of the biggest concerns being that the macro environment and a slowing economy may weigh on the stock. But I think everybody's kind of saying that. Now, here's a max chart, and you can see a lot of stocks like this look like that round trip over the pandemic. Now it's kind of a long slog to get back to the top, but a decent start there for Spotify. Now, we got to get to Exxon Mobil, and let me dial this down to a one year chart. We're talking about records for the oil major. Now they missed on revenue, but they posted a record profit of $59.1 billion for the year. Now this is a bit shy of the $98.8 billion that's expected from Apple this Thursday. But when it comes to cash flow, it's knocking on Apple's door there too. And let me just show you this chart that we have prepared here. This has to do with the cash flow, record cash flow, raked in by U.S. companies as part of the S&P 500. Here's Apple, the top spot in 2022. They raked in $122 billion. And then at the bottom we got Exxon. They raked in $76.8 billion. So for the U.S. oil majors, it's all about the return of cash flow. And now we want to move on just a little bit here because we got McDonald's. Now that stock is taking a little bit of a hit here. It's down about 2.5%. And let's see what we got here. We can see it's in the upper end of its range here on a one-year basis. The key metric of global same-store sales, that was a nice beat for the comps. That was up 3% in the quarter. Now CEO Chris Kyrzymski highlights the company's focus on technology, also its ability to deliver options through that delivery system. That's reaping dividends for the company. The delivery sales more than doubled in the quarter. And after the bell, guess what? Focus going to turn to AMD. So let me get up our chip sector here. Now the chip sector is very highly levered to the business cycle, meaning it has the vicissitudes of the ups and downs. We can see AMD up 2.5% today. Chipstock's doing pretty well this year. You can see AMD is up 15%. And the company is potentially set to beat its test about its prospects for growth this year. This is amid a general malaise among its competitors. So AMD is still making headway into the server space. And if Mark Zuckerberg's metaverse stream ever comes through, AMD is set to profit. Now traders are pricing a 19% move after the bell, so stay tuned. You're not going to want to miss it. We're going to bring that to you live. Guys? All right, great stuff. A very long play on that metaverse. But you know, we're seeing a lot of movement in metaverse. It could happen. Some people still bullish on it. It could. Anything could. We're going to have to edge our bleakery for us.","In the given paragraph, Spotify's stock rose by about 10% on a one-year basis after beating expectations on Premium subscriber gains, Exxon Mobil posted a record profit of $59.1 billion for the year despite missing on revenue, and McDonald's stock was down around 2.5% despite a positive beat in global same store sales. AMD's stock was up 2.5% and the company is up 15% for the year, potentially set to beat growth prospects, especially in the server space. The chip sector, including AMD, is doing well this year, and there is a 19% expected price movement after the Bell for AMD."
19,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PYAHt-8du4,4PYAHt-8du4," All right, well, staying with the chips conversation, the United States reportedly furthering its crackdown on the Chinese tech sector and specifically Huawei. Now, this is the likes of AMD and Qualcomm gear up to report quarterly results. Here to discuss the wider sector is Thomas Hayes, a Great Hill Capital Chairman and managing partner. Good to see you, Thomas. So a lot to unpack here. Thank you. So as we look at some of the pressures that are in this sector, give us the temperature of what's been happening as we look at this push by U.S. policy makers and the ripple effects. Yeah, it's been a strong move since October. The U.S. kind of made U.S. chipmakers get a license in order to sell advanced calculations and semiconducting equipment to China. So moving forward, the big news now is that they've gotten the Netherlands and Japan to join on restricting exports of advanced chipmaking equipment. This is a big deal because ASML focuses on the extreme ultraviolet lithography machines. They're the only company in the world that makes them, whereas Japan focuses on the deep ultraviolet light lithography machines. And this will hamstring China's initiative to develop their own semiconductor business domestically, but it won't completely impair it. I mean, right now SMIC, which is the big fab that was developed in 2000 to compete with Taiwan Semiconductor, is producing chips at about 45 nanometers versus Taiwan Semiconductor, though, is producing at 7 nanometers. So I think the big issue that came today is now it's a unified front. It's not just the U.S. unilaterally making these restrictions. It's now the Netherlands and Japan, which are the major suppliers for this advanced machinery. And obviously this is coming at a time where we have a chip glut at the moment and we're seeing that ripple effect then affecting some of these Asian suppliers as well. What is the outlook then? Because obviously demand isn't going to be picking up anytime soon from some of the estimates that we're looking at. What is the play here for some of these chip companies? Well, we may have hit peak inventory. And usually when we hit peak inventory historically, the sector starts to rally in anticipation of it easing. And we may have actually seen the bottom of semiconductors in October. I know that's hard to believe when you saw Intel really not deliver what everyone expected last week. But I think if you look longer term, and I think we're going to see some more green shoots from AMD tonight and maybe even Qualcomm. Qualcomm is with the handsets, but AMD has the data center and the PCs has been the most hurt. The other thing to keep in mind when you see like Texas Instruments, the auto industry, the amount of chips that go into each car is accelerating. And there's been two years of pent up demand for new cars. We do think used cars will do poorly in the next year or two. However, we think new cars with dealer incentives, and you're already seeing it with Tesla cutting prices, with Ford following suit with their Mach-E, that demand for chips and capacity is going to shift to auto chip demand. And with the average car on the road at 13.1 years old, Rochelle, I think that the chip sector is going to do just fine reallocating that capacity until the data center, the PC and the handsets recovers after some pull forward in 2020 and 2021. I mean, and as we look at things like handsets in terms of strategy, we're looking at Samsung. They're actually expecting, they're actually going to be increasing their keeping their capital spending at last year's levels when you have Micron, Hynix, Kyosha, all pulling back on their spending. What's your take on that strategy? What could they potentially be risking by focusing so much on market share that they might end up losing out on profitability? Well, I think they're certainly playing the long game. I think you saw the IMF last night come out and say that global growth is going to be better than expected. I think a lot of people really underestimated the impact of China's reopening. The government set 5% reopening targets. The government in China has also been stimulating and easing since March of last year, but it didn't matter until they opened the doors and allowed people to leave their apartments and get back to life. All the stimulus in the world wasn't going to help. Now it's all happening at once. You have nine months of backlogged stimulus, monetary policy easing, coupled with people getting back to life and the pent up demand, revenge spending, revenge travel like we saw in the US from late 2020 to 2021. That's now just starting. I do think those 5% GDP targets that the government set are going to be very, very conservative. We're seeing a lot of banks now come out expecting growth. What that means for the global economy, a rising tide lifts all boats. The second largest economy in the world is going to grow faster than expected, and that's going to help Europe tremendously, which is why everyone calling for a recession in Europe this winter has been incorrect. In part, number one, the US has stepped up as a natural gas producer. Number two, that China reopening is really helping get things back in gear. Number three, it's going to help US earnings. That's a key factor moving forward because the S&P 500, some of the considerable amount of those earnings will benefit from China's reopening as well. I think things are pointing in the right direction and I think Samsung might be right to play the long game, pick up share while everyone else is weak. Inventories are peaking and then when the demand picks up in 12 or 18 months, they've gained share. Now it's interesting because Samsung is expecting the chip recovery to begin in the second half of this year. Are you seeing anything that supports that kind of recovery starting that quickly? I do. I see it in the auto sector. You have seen capacity reallocation, where there's excess supply in the handsets and the PCs. They've been moving towards auto and every single company that provides auto chips has been reporting record sales, demand is picking up, and you're seeing it also in the automakers starting to rise because they're finally getting the chips they need to sell cars. For two years, on the one hand, they had the luxury of selling above sticker and people would pay whatever they could to get the limited supply. Now, the chips are coming in, the semiconductors companies are making a lot of money on the chips, but now the OEMs, the car manufacturers are putting supply on the lots. They're going to start to do incentives and you're going to see a massive amount of new cars. We do think used cars will do very, very poorly over the next 12 to 24 months. New cars are going to do much better than expected. Everyone's saying in a slowdown, no one's going to buy new cars, but in a 7% interest rate environment, when the dealers start coming out and saying 0% APR, 2.9% APR, you can buy it at sticker or below sticker, I think people with their 13-year-old cars on average are going to get out there and take advantage. That offer certainly will start looking a lot better. A big thank you there, Thomas Hayes, Great Hill Capital Chairman and managing member. Thank you so much.","The US, Netherlands, and Japan are cracking down on China's tech sector and limiting chipmaking equipment exports. Despite this, the chip sector could rally as the inventory glut ends, and auto chip demand grows. Samsung expects a chip recovery in H2 2023 and is playing the long game."
20,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8k2TuCjh7U,w8k2TuCjh7U," The cost of living indices have peaked in the last part of last year and are now coming down. Broader measures of inflation that are more exclude energy and food prices, what we call core inflation, these have not yet peaked and come down in many parts of the world. Well, that was IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Grunscher painting the contrast between the US and other countries still struggling with inflation. Now, one surprising entrant in that second category, the UK, the only leading economy, the IMF says, will see a recession this year. Now, the bank calling for a contraction of up to 0.6%, citing the country's energy exposures and lower numbers of job seekers compared to other countries, allowing prices to rise unchecked. And of course, still waiting for the hangover of Brexit to kick in all the way in the UK as well. Well, before we go, let's give you a final check of the markets as we head into the noon hour. We see still positive territory, though relatively flat, at least for the Dow, they're just up slightly there, about a quarter of a percent, 87 points. The S&P 500, they're up two thirds of a percent of 30 points and the NASDAQ up 1%. As we keep an eye on what's been happening with the earnings season, seeing how as everything rolls out, really people, investors trying to get a gauge on what this means for consumers going forward. We know consumers have been pulling back on spending and we'll be getting some more bellwether earnings coming out this week. And of course, everyone holding their collective breath from the Fed meeting today will get the Fed announcement tomorrow. So a lot of investors holding back on that as well, expecting that 25 basis point hike. But then this is a new phase that the Fed is entering here. It's gone to that normalcy of 25 basis point hikes. So we'll see how that plays out for consumers and fears of recession, which hasn't come off the table yet. And of course, a lot of analysts debating whether or not this is going to be a deep recession or prolonged stagflation. Well, that'll do it for now. I'm Rochelle Okuva. I'll be back with you at 11 a.m. Eastern. I'll see you then.","IMF's chief economist talks about the inflation disparity between the US and other countries. The UK is predicted to be the sole leading economy experiencing a recession in 2023 with a projected contraction of up to 0.6 percent, attributed to energy exposures, fewer job seekers, Brexit-related impacts, and unchecked rising prices."
21,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBPN9IMUWuI,oBPN9IMUWuI," Pfizer reporting that earnings beat for the fourth quarter, but issuing some weak guidance for its COVID-19 vaccine products. Yahoo Finance's Anjali Kemlali joins us now with more. We see there the stock under pressure as a result. That's right, Rachelle. Unfortunately, we know that with everything that is going on with the pandemic as it stands right now with the White House itself calling for the end of the pandemic in May, the companies, including Pfizer, are now looking for a downgrade in what they expect for sales related to their COVID products. That includes for Pfizer specifically the Comoranati vaccine that it shares with BioNTech as well as Paxlovid, the treatment downgrading those to basically a fraction of what we saw in recent years. Thirteen point five billion is the revenue estimate for twenty three and eight billion for Paxlovid there you see on your screen. Meanwhile, the company boasting a beyond one hundred billion dollars for the first time in full year revenue for twenty twenty two. That's the first time the company has reached that high in its one hundred and seventy four year history, I believe. And so that's something that they're pretty excited about. And of course, we know this all comes because of those covid products. If you look at the quarter over quarter when the company was breaking out its revenue for a time, you saw that operational growth really surpassed. I mean, significant numbers. They were just 82 percent, for example, in the first quarter of twenty two compared to without covid products, an increase of two percent. And you can see on your screen just how that progressed over time. So getting beyond that now, the company is really looking beyond what they can do. So the covid products is one obstacle. The other one is a loss of exclusivity on some of their products. Looking at a hit of 17 billion in the coming years. And that is something that Pfizer's CEO Albert Brouillard has specifically talked about with recent acquisitions as well as 19 products in the pipeline being able to offset that 17 billion. That's the expectation for this year and through the upcoming years. And so we'll have to see how that all pans out. And that's one of the reasons why some analysts, including at Wells Fargo, they downgraded Pfizer recently, hoping to see some of that come to fruition. So right now, the company really focused kind of back to square one a little bit of where they were pre pandemic on trying to focus and prove the point that they are more than just a X, Y, Z company, in this case, more than just a vaccine company and more than just a covid company. So really setting the stage here as many of the comments from the executives today, really setting the stage for strong capital allocation, including, by the way, more focus on the commercialization of the covid vaccine. And that is going to need as well, you know, sales and support. So they're spending on that as well as R&D. So full picture, a lot still going on for Pfizer right now. So a lot to adjust to as we come off the peak of the pandemic and look for the path forward. Aisley Kenlani, thanks so much.","Pfizer's Q4 earnings strong but weak guidance on COVID-19 vaccine products puts stock under pressure. Company looking beyond with acquisitions and pipeline products to offset loss of exclusivity.Pfizer's revenue estimate for 2023 is $13.5 billion for the Comirnaty vaccine and $8 billion for Paxlovid treatment. The company achieved over $100 billion in full-year revenue for 2022, a historic high. Pfizer experienced significant operational growth due to COVID products, with 82% growth in Q1 2022 compared to 2% without them. Pfizer is facing a potential loss of exclusivity on certain products, projecting a hit of $17 billion in the coming years."
22,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLNhSuRMW4s,TLNhSuRMW4s," The Federal Reserve is expected to announce it will continue hiking interest rates as Fed officials meet for their first policy meeting of 2023. Here's what you need to know. Economists widely expect the Fed to raise interest rates by a quarter point at this week's FOMC meeting, further slowing the pace of increases following a year of aggressive action to tame inflation. They're telling us the intent is to take policy into a restrictive stance and then to hold there for an extended period of time. But the battle against inflation is complicated, and the Fed walks a fine line between bringing down prices while also avoiding a major recession. We do have weakness in a lot of data, but they're focused mostly on the labor market, and the job gains while decelerating have still been pretty resilient. Although job growth has slowed in recent months, the unemployment rate remains at historic lows, coming in at just 3.5% in December. The latest inflation data has also shown some easing. The PCE index coming in at 4.4% in December, down from 4.7% the month before, though that's still much higher than the Fed's preferred 2% inflation target. The economy is beginning to show cracks in other areas as well. Consumer and business spending slowed in the fourth quarter, followed by weaker retail sales and recent layoffs across the tech sector. FED officials will be weighing all of these factors as the central bank determines its interest rate policy, and investors will be watching closely for new insight into how much further rates will rise and any signs the Fed may pause in the near future.","Fed expected to raise interest rates despite weakening data to tame inflation and avoid a recession.  The unemployment rate stands at three and a half percent as of December, while the latest inflation data shows the PCE index at 4.4 percent, down from 4.7 percent the previous month but still above the Fed's two percent target.

23,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5w36_0GlAQ,h5w36_0GlAQ," Alright, let's take a look at some of the big movers of the day and take a look at Lucid because this stock has been on a wild ride over the past two trading days. Lucid closing off just over 8% today, still up about 30% when you factor in today's trading action and Friday's trading action. The two-day jump coming on the heels of news that Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund will potentially want to buy out the rest of the EV makers shares here. Saudi Arabia's fund already owns about 60% of Lucid, a lot of excitement following that speculation. Those reports, Dave, on Friday coming back down just a bit, giving up some of those gains today. But I think the big question here going forward with Lucid is what this company is going to look like given the broader macroeconomic landscape right now, given the competition from Tesla, given the fact that the price cuts placing even more pressure on a name like Lucid. You're scratching your head here really trying to figure out what this company looks like when you move forward. Yeah, I don't know how much they're impacted by those price cuts. This is a much more expensive end of the segment. You're talking about the cheapest Lucid car, $87,000, and most of them priced well north of $100K, so it's a very different consumer. But Morgan Stanley did say they are impacted by what they call the Hunger Games pricing war, which is pretty descriptive. But that stock, just a wild ride Friday, 43% climbing was halted 12 times. I think they really do need that Saudi acquisition, although the Saudi fund did not comment and Lucid did not comment. It sounds as though that has not been squashed. It sounds like it is still a distinct possibility out there and something they desperately need because to your point, fundamentals of this company, a record 3,500 cars produced in Q4, 3,500. They squandered whatever first mover advantage they had over Tesla. And it seems like, I know we're in the early innings of the EV game, but when you don't take advantage of that first mover advantage, it seems like it can get dark really early. Yeah, exactly. And especially right now, just given that broader economic landscape, a shrinking consumer wallet, clearly an issue here for Lucid, for Rivian, some of those cars that are so expensive. Like you said, Wall Street seems to be a little bit mixed. We had a number of price targets cut in the week or so leading up to this report on Friday. Morgan Stanley lowered its price target to five bucks a share. CFRA lowered their price target to 12 bucks a share. So we'll see whether or not this deal, in fact, it does go through.","Lucid stock surges 30% amid buyout speculation by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, but concerns persist about the company's future given competition from Tesla, high prices, and missed opportunities.The stock of Lucid has recently experienced significant volatility, with an over 8 percent decrease in its closing price today. The surge in the stock's value followed news that Saudi Arabia's public investment fund, which already owns about 60 percent of Lucid, is considering a potential buyout of the remaining shares. The company produced a record 3,500 cars in Q4, but it appears to have lost its initial advantage over Tesla in the electric vehicle market. The stock's price targets have been adjusted, with Morgan Stanley lowering its target to five dollars a share and cfra lowering theirs to 12 dollars a share, reflecting mixed sentiments on Wall Street regarding the potential buyout deal."
24,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFnW4D6bDOY,WFnW4D6bDOY," Will 2023 bring the dreaded return to office? We're already here. Data from Castle Systems who track bad swipes. So a 10-city average occupancy is at a post-pandemic high, albeit still below 50 percent. Well out of the pandemic, what's the impact of remote work on commercial real estate values? Kevin Fagan is the head of commercial real estate analysis at Moody's Analytics. Kevin, good to see you. How do you measure the impact of remote work on commercial real estate values? Well, that's a million dollar question right now. And I think there are a lot of us in the forecasting and analytics side have been working on that for the last three years, actually. I think this is going to be a really exciting year because we're finally going to be really this the first year we'll be fully past covid. And we'll be able to use this as a bellwether year to see what the return to office actually looks like. You know, we had Omicron last summer and we had Omicron last year. And then the summer, the fall, there was kind of a comeback. But now this is the real full comeback. And we'll get to see exactly when these leases start expiring, these long term leases for offices, of which there's a lot expiring in 2023. We'll get to see what's actually happening when tenants are making decisions about how much space per employee they want to take versus what they did pre covid. We've seen a little bit of that, but at this stage right now, we're in such a transition period where companies are trying to figure that out. We haven't gotten a lot of really solid clues yet. There's been just as many stories of, you know, tenants resigning for as much space or more than they had before, like in the last three years. And we've also seen a lot of the stories where tenants are pulling back. It really depends a lot on the individual companies. But we haven't seen a widespread shift away from it. But this year might offer some real clues for the first time. Yeah, it seems like most you talk to are reducing that footprint. Do you get a sense that returned office versus remote work is at least beginning to level out in twenty three? Yeah, I think that I think that castle number that you showed there of nearly about, let's say, right around 60 percent makes a lot of sense. You're going to have a lot of hybrid working now where you have people coming in maybe two days a week, three days a week. Maybe it'll average around three. That's kind of what we see from a lot of surveys. So you kind of lop off the beginning and the week that basically means your badge swipes. The cat, the castle is monitoring has is going to level out somewhere around 60 percent. And that makes sense. Now, the real key here is of that 40 percent where you don't have people in the office. How can you how efficiently can you turn that into less office space? And it's not really clear that you can be that efficient with that. So that's that's the kind of magic number, your efficiency factor. So how have those buildings that that are now much more competitive, those buildings, those landlords, how have they been forced to evolve in what they're offering potential tenants? Yeah, we started to see offices get to be managed more and more like hospitality, even pre-COVID. That was really kind of starting to ramp up. We actually saw a lot of partial remote working somewhere around the order of nine to 10 percent on average across the nation. So obviously, COVID changed that. But even even before COVID, we started to see hospitality like management of offices, especially in that high end class, a high amenity space already start to happen. Hudson Yards is a great example in New York. And really, I think that's going to evolve in a really major way. I wouldn't say it's kind of like the iPhone revolutionizing cell phones back in 2007 exactly. But we are at a real precipice here where the experience of the office is about to be very different. So dynamic social spaces actually here at Moody's, we just finished a floor that's very archetypical of what we're seeing now and a lot of renovations of office space where you have just an incredible amount of collaborative, different kinds of collaborative space, recharge areas. We have two libraries in that new space. We have like three different types of collaborative space. You have recharge space. I think you're going to see a lot more of that, a lot more outdoor space. So, yeah, that's really the design changes are pretty dramatic. I recently played pickleball at a New York office building. Moving forward, the concept of conversion from commercial slash office space to residential. Where are we seeing that and how much do you think it'll pick up in 2023? Yeah, you have to have a pretty steep decline in values and rents for offices to be viable, viable candidates for conversion into into apartment. We had done a study on New York where we found that maybe three percent were viable candidates from both like a physical shape of the buildings, because some buildings cannot really be efficiently converted into apartments, but also just economically. We hadn't seen a big enough decline in office space, excuse me, office values and office rents for it to be profitable for builders to actually take the risk of that kind of conversion. Very interesting trends to watch this year. Moody's Analytics, head of commercial analysis. Kevin Feigen, good to see you. Thank you.","Long-term impact of remote work on commercial real estate values uncertain; offices evolving to hybrid workspaces with more amenities, but conversion to residential buildings unlikely without significant decline in office values and rents. Castle Systems data reveals a post-pandemic high occupancy below 50%. The year 2023 is seen as a bellwether for understanding the return to the office, as long-term leases expire and companies decide on space per employee. "

Kicking it off with Whirlpool. We're looking at gains here in extended trading up just about 2%. Some nuggets here from this earnings report. Guidance meeting the street's expectations. They see revenue of $19.4 billion for the year. EPS outlook in line with the street's estimates as well. A reason why we're seeing the stock pop here in extended trading.

The stock closed their trading day a lower here over the last three months. Looking at gains of nearly 10% ahead of this earnings report. The company announced that its president and COO would be leaving the company. All right. Let's take a look at NXP semiconductors again. A mover here in extended trading will get losses of nearly 4%. Now the company here revenue forecast missing the streets expectations. That's a huge driver in this extended hours trading activity right now Q4 EPS did beat the streets expectation revenue coming in just in line up about 9% on a year-over-year basis, but that weak guidance that is what's dragging the stock lower after hours over the last three months. We're looking at gains of just about 18% over the last six months of a bit of a longer-term chart there. The stock has essentially been flat off just about 2% Dave. Okay, Shawna. Thank you.","Whirlpool beat earnings expectations, stock up 2% in after-hours trading. NXP Semiconductors missed revenue forecast, stock down nearly 4%.

Injuries no doubt hurt the ratings as the Eagles eviscerated the Niners down to their fourth string QB. But a massive number well north of 30, probably 40 million no doubt watched Patrick Mahomes escape to top burrow. And the Bengals should get those numbers later tonight. Just the latest example of the NFL continuing to assert its will over the entire television landscape. However, the league took a big L in their streaming kickoff ratings for Amazon. Third, they night football down astounding 41% from 2021 from an average of 16.4 million to fewer than 10 million viewers ratings for ESPN solid. Just slightly down from last season 13.4 million Eagles Chiefs will be awesome. More than 110 million people. Excuse me will watch while the battle bean counters are considering is ratings versus revenue. And this one is a blowout unlike the Super Bowl. Amazon and the NFL want more viewers on Thursday night, but cash is king here. The league still featured 88 of the top 100 most watched shows in 2022. And here's the score that matters most 113 billion dollars over 11 seasons. That's how much the league's media partners will fork over YouTube Sunday NFL ticket deal said to be worth as much as 2.5 bill per year. The commission he sees cord cutting accelerating more than 20 million since 2014. A number expected to grow to 80 million by 26. The most common age group to audios cable 18 to 29 year olds. Amazon would point out their median age viewer this season is 47. That may sound old. It's seven years younger than the legacy networks. The ratings will improve as streaming picks up and the matchups will also improve. Al Michaels called him dreadful and acquitted them to selling used cars. They have to be better, but like the big banks, the NFL is too big to fail and they're too big to care about one ratings miss like recent earnings reports. Guidance is all that matters here and football is 100% recession proof. My point being a lot of people are making a lot of the streaming number Shana and for good reason. It's Amazon, but they're not scared. They're not scared one bit growth is all there. The league will continue to explode when it comes to television ratings and Amazon's numbers. I think will grow over the years NFL's big question was would it look competent? Would the stream go down with the broadcasters be solid? It looked like just like NBC or CBS except for the awful matchups. Well, it was just an amazing amazing way that they did this season. Like you were saying expectations were so low. I think initially there was a lot of fanfare about how maybe they would include certain things that would stick out just in terms of streaming versus traditional cable. Clearly we didn't get that but like you're saying there is no huge mishaps in terms of airing these games. That was a massive win for Amazon. Everything that's come out of Amazon saying how pleased they were how excited they were with how smooth this season went big question. I think going forward as we do see more and more games stream year over the next several years just how that of course then differs lots of questions about how Amazon might be able to incorporate more of its business its prime business into those broadcasts. But clearly NFL is a massive winner here Super Bowl coming up. Like you said about 110 million people expected to watch no slowing down in the NFL right now. I expect that shopping will inevitably become part of the NFL Amazon broadcast. I don't think we're going to see it for three four, maybe even five years as they want to prove competency first. But keep an eye on this Black Friday NFL game this coming season on NFL on Amazon. I don't know how there won't be some type of shopping collaboration. It's unavoidable. Oh, it's unavoidable. And it's so so smart here. What do you got Eagles or Chiefs? Eagles. I'm from Philly. It's not even a question. You do. We're going to talk about it. We got two weeks to convince you otherwise.","NFL dominates TV ratings, media partners pay billions for broadcast rights. League remains highly popular and recession-proof.

27,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwjZL3_FaL0,TwjZL3_FaL0," Tech earnings on tap this week. Meta, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, just to name a few, all up between 9% and 16% this year, all reporting earnings this week. Overall, analysts are bullish on the tech sector despite recent headwinds. And Amazon has the highest percentage of buy ratings on the street. Let's just start with a little Amazon talk. Basically nothing is out of their reach right now. Still an AWS story, but they're into healthcare now, streaming gets the most headlines, probably the slowest part of the story. Stock down 32% in the last year, up 16%. A lot of upside ahead. Not clear what to make of this week's earnings report. It's not clear what to make of this week's earnings reports, especially after what we saw last week from Microsoft. One of the big worrisome headlines in that report from Microsoft was slowing growth going, looking ahead for its Azure business. So that placed a lot of questions just in terms of what we could hear from Amazon for AWS. We know that's so important there to their business. So any guidance there, I think is really going to be key. But it's interesting when you take a look at those analysts ratings with Amazon, the largest percentage of buy ratings here on the street when it comes to some of those bigger tech name plays. Clearly a huge focus will be on Amazon. Dave, I'm also closely watching Meta because we talked about the fact that Meta clearly, one of the worst performers of the year, looking back to 2022, it's hard to really see that changing when you take a look at the fundamentals at least of their business outside, just a pure valuation play at this point. Clearly a tough road ahead, losses in the reality labs segment that of course could actually exceed what they predicted, exceed that 4 billion number. So that of course will be a focal point here in this report and layoffs. We know layoffs is something we've heard from many of these companies except for Apple. So we'll see whether or not that changes. No way, you think it'll change? I don't think so. No way. Tim Cook's not going to do it. I don't think we can count it out. Only increased headcount about 20% from pre-pandemic. So I guess I'm not ready for Tim Cook to declare layoffs are here. Yeah, Meta is the one that, I still don't think they're through the woods yet, but if you look back to November, the stock's up more than 60% since November 3rd. So investors feel otherwise, they're not through the Metaverse mess, right? They've still got some cost cutting, still probably some more layoffs. Amazon, we showed that chart. 93% are bullish on it. How about Alphabet real quickly? 92% of analysts are bullish on the case for Google Parent Alphabet. And when it comes to them, two threats for me. AI, which obviously the chat GPT threat, some have now suggested this is a major threat to search. We're not going to see that in the earnings report. We probably won't hear about that in the call, but the threat of AI and the threat of anti-tech, anti-trust regulation from the government, those are the two things weighing on Alphabet. Yeah, certainly a massive challenges here for that tech giant ahead of these results. I think we might get a question or two from analysts about those things, because clearly when you look at the forward looking picture here with Google, with Alphabet, a lot of those question marks about the second half of 2023 into 2024 really weighs heavily on those two huge issues that you just brought up.","Major tech companies including Meta, Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet are reporting earnings this week. Amazon is expected to perform well, while Meta faces potential layoffs and Alphabet faces regulatory risks. Analysts remain optimistic about the industry overall. Tech stocks have shown mixed performance, with Amazon down 32% in the last year but up 16% this year, while Meta has surged over 60% since November 3rd; analysts express bullish sentiment with the highest percentage of buy ratings for Amazon and a 92% bullish rating for Alphabet.

28,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q82tnt-26-A,q82tnt-26-A," All right, well as earnings season heats up this week, a slew of high profile companies have a proven track record of performing better than others. Jared Blicker is here with a closer look. And Jared, who's expected to top expectations this time around? Well not surprisingly, Apple is looking the best on my list here, but I just wanted to go over the performance of some of these mega caps. Now this is the Nasdaq 100 year to date, so some high flyers here, especially in terms of the big names. We've got Amazon up 20%, we've got Meta up 23%, Tesla up almost 40%, NVIDIA up 32%. And this comes after a terrible year. Let's not forget that Meta had two quarters last year where they missed something by like 20%, well the price reaction was something like 20% down the next day. So what I've done is I've looked at three stocks that are reporting this week. We've got Apple, Meta, and Amazon. And Apple you can see usually beats its number 91% of the time. You think that'd be great and everything, but the one day price percent change, that is going to 52%, so barely better than half. And this goes back 10 years. And the results are, for all three of these, the results are all three, skewed a little bit to the downside by what's happened over the last year. Now sticking with Apple, the median EPS price is 4.1%, so that's in terms of the earnings per share amount beat. And then the median one day price change, 2.1%. That is only the, for Apple, I got to say that is actually pretty low. Throughout history it has been higher at times. And then you do the same analysis for Meta and Amazon. Now Meta EPS beat 86%, notwithstanding what I was talking about those misses over the last year. One day per percent price change, 52%. These numbers really don't square going down the mark. So I think what I want to say here is day traders, great. If you have the opportunity to get involved in one of these trades before the bell the next day into the close, great. But this doesn't necessarily have predictive power about the stock, and that just has to do with the environment that we're in. One of the stats that I like to look at is options implied one day price change. And that's done, that's signaled by the options market. So for instance, for Apple, we're looking at an options market that is pricing in a 4% price change after the fact. What happens historically, usually only about half of that, 2.1%. Meta, we're looking at an 8% change. Amazon, we're looking at a 9% change. So my other conclusion is this is probably going to be a volatile week and we're probably going to see some bigger reactions even in these big names than we would ordinarily. Alright Jared, good stuff. Thank you my friend.","High profile tech companies such as Apple, Meta, and Amazon have a history of beating earnings expectations during earnings season, but the percentage change in stock price can be unpredictable and volatile. This week is expected to be a particularly volatile one. Amazon's stock has gone up 20%, Meta (formerly Facebook) has increased by 23%, Tesla has risen almost 40%, and Nvidia is up 32% year-to-date on the NASDAQ 100. Apple usually beats earnings expectations 91% of the time, with a median EPS price beat of 4.1% and a median one-day price range of 2.1%. Meta's EPS beat is 86%, with a one-day price range of 52%. For Apple, the options market indicates a predicted four percent price change, while Meta is at eight percent and Amazon at nine percent. This suggests a potentially volatile week with significant reactions in these stocks after earnings reports."
29,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpjf1DhEMok,fpjf1DhEMok," Ford, we talked about them earlier, Ford will report earnings on Thursday and share as well. A bit of a rough day today. Up more than 10% though this year, you see the fall today. The automaker plans to make your life easier though when it comes to repairs. Most Ford dealers will actually participate in a program that promises to pick your car up for service, drop it off when it's repaired. If however it's routine maintenance like an oil change, mobile technicians can do the work right there at your house. Ford will pay dealers to participate in the program. So basically if you're one of those people that likes your dry cleaning picked up and dropped off on hangers with starch, this new service is for you, Shawn. Does that sound like something that appears? Certainly for me. I think it's a huge deal. It's really difficult. You've got to go get a deal, you've got to have someone pick you up, you've got to have someone drop you off. It seems like a big win for the customer. It's a massive win for the customer and it really just speaks to the competitive landscape right out there right now for automakers. They need to be creative, they need to come up with certain segments, certain offerings that are tailored directly to their consumer. I think this is very, very smart. Guessing GM is going to have to match that in the year ahead.","Ford is launching a service where dealers will pick up and drop off customers' cars for servicing, with mobile technicians available for routine maintenance at their homes. It has dropped by 2.82%."
30,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dq27q7mI2BQ,dq27q7mI2BQ," Well, while long term sentiment on crypto is bullish among financial advisors, limited access and regulatory uncertainty concerns remain a pain point for greater crypto adoption in portfolios. Here with more of the details is Matt Hogan, Bitwise Asset Management CIO. Good to see you, Matt. So obviously a lot of retail investors have a lot of concerns with the FTX fallout and everything else. But in terms of what you're seeing financial advisors, what are they hearing from clients? What's standing out to you right now? Yeah, the incredible thing. We just finished a survey of financial advisors and they are hearing from clients. That's the incredible thing. You know, last year was such a massive pullback in the crypto markets, but we heard that 90 percent of financial advisors fielded questions from clients about crypto. And the number one question was, should I invest? I think investors have seen this bull and bear market in crypto in the past, and they know that each time crypto has pulled back significantly, it's gone on to recover and move to all time highs. So financial advisors are hearing from clients. Should we be exposed to that? And an increasing number of them are saying yes. And then, Matt, when we translate that interest into what we actually see in client portfolios, I mean, it is a low number, 15 percent allocating in client accounts. And you attribute that mostly to access as well as some perhaps a bit of uncertainty as people try and figure out what's going to happen with this crypto environment. That's exactly right. More than half of the financial advisors we surveyed said they could not get exposure to crypto and client accounts, maybe because they work for a firm that blocks it or their regulatory hurdles for them. Among financial advisors who can allocate more than 50 percent do. And the reason is simple. Crypto is an incredible, asymmetric return asset that you can put in portfolios in small amounts and have a large impact on that portfolio. It is the case that access is improving. The number of national account platforms that Bitwise products are on tripled over the last year and increasingly advisors are looking at things like crypto equity ETFs as an easier on ramp into the space. So access remains a major gating factor, but it's improving quickly. And that's going to bring the assets that financial advisors manage into the crypto space in the next year, two years and three years. So, Matt, then for those who do have access, but it's still choosing not to invest, what are the biggest headwinds for them? What's giving them the most pause? Yeah, it's funny. We've asked that question five years in a row and the answer has been the same regulation. Advisors want more regulation of the crypto space so they feel more secure, so their client assets are more secure. And that's actually an interesting insight for viewers. There are a lot of people out there who think the headlines around regulation and crypto are scary. Like every time the White House puts out a report or Congress takes steps, that's going to be a negative for the crypto market. That's actually not right. More regulation is going to be a positive for the crypto market because it's going to bring the professional investing class into the market. And remember, financial advisors and institutions have about four times as much assets as retail investors. So this is a huge wave of money. When you see regulatory headlines around crypto, you see that the market is going to be biased towards thinking that's a good thing and not a bad thing. And you'll be able to interpret how the market responds. And Matt, we know that one of the reasons that the government doesn't want to see crypto and things like 401K and other things is because really that explanation of risk, really understanding, because there's a lot of people out there with a lot of high evaluations for where Bitcoin could go long term. A lot of that's still unproven at the moment. So then how soon do you think this will be a really great opportunity for financial advisors when you do still have so many policy headwinds in between? Yeah, look, I think it's an incredible business development opportunity for financial advisors today, because right now their clients are doing it on their own. Remember, Coinbase has 100 million retail accounts. When advisors ask clients if they're investing on their own, they said, yes, those clients would do better if they brought the assets in-house with the advisors so they can be managed in a professional fashion. The percentage of advisors who allocate to crypto and client accounts has been going up for the past five years. When we started this survey, only four percent of financial advisors had allocations. Today, it's 15. I think four years from now it will be over 50 percent. So it's coming. Regulation is coming and advisors need to educate themselves around the space to stay ahead of this trend. But Matt, we know that a lot of people switch to some of these hard wallets. They don't want to have another person managing their crypto. What's the selling point then for having a financial advisor versus keeping everything on your own hard wallet? Yeah, I think there are valid instances of both. If you have incredible security hygiene as an individual and you're a really strong sort of institutionally oriented investor that you'll not panic and sell when the market goes down, that you'll rebalance your portfolio, then absolutely do it on your own. But if you're not, if you're like 90 percent of Americans who don't have days and weeks to dedicate to this yourself, you're probably better with a financial advisor surveying the market, finding the best product, deciding if you want to be in crypto equities or crypto assets like Bitcoin and then using crypto in a portfolio the same way you use stocks and bonds and other assets. You don't need to think of it outside those bands. So sure, some investors will do well doing it themselves if they have that incredible security hygiene. But if not, trust an advisor to find a regulated partner who establishes funds in the market, has been doing it for a number of years and go in that direction. They're both valid paths. And Matt, it does seem people are really playing the long game here. I mean, 60 percent of the clients surveyed bullish on Bitcoin going up at that five year point. And we are expecting a halving for Bitcoin to come in 2024. What do you think is going to be the triggering event for a bull run in Bitcoin? Yeah, I actually think we're already in it. If you look at the returns this year, we're up more than 40 percent. I think we'll end the year higher than we are today. Crypto has historically moved in four year cycles with three up years and one pullback year. We saw that again. Twenty twenty two was the pullback year, but there's a lot of exciting technological developments. So I think we're in the new bull cycle. But when does it go back to all time highs? That will take regulatory progress. It will take the passage of time. It won't be easy. I suspect it'll be volatile. But as you said, a large number of advisors think it's going in that direction over the next five years. I think that's a good time window. We will get there. We're already starting on that bullish path. And and you can expect that to continue. We'll definitely check back with you. See, we see where Bitcoin goes. Obviously, anything can happen. Black smart events like Covid or what happens in the Ukraine and Russia can certainly throw a wrench into things. A big thank you for joining me this morning. Matt Hogan, Bitwise Asset Management CIO. Thanks so much.","Financial advisors report growing client interest in cryptocurrency but face limited access and regulatory uncertainty. They call for increased regulation in the crypto space, highlighting the need for education to stay ahead of the trend. it was found that 90% of them received client questions about crypto, with the top question being whether to invest.

31,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQCf7Or0xZ4,XQCf7Or0xZ4," Well, the Fed isn't the only thing weighing on markets. The ongoing debate about the debt ceiling also has the potential to dampen sentiment. This alongside recent economic data is leading some economists to say there won't be a soft landing for the US, but also that the recession won't be as dire as some say. Joining us with more is Elliot Hentoff, head of policy research at State Street Global Advisers. Good to see you, Elliot. Obviously a big steward of things. We are expecting some volatility ahead of this debt ceiling standoff, though I don't think anyone's actually expecting a default. But when you add that with already uncertainty about when the Fed will pivot and perhaps bond markets pricing a little too much optimism, how should investors be looking at this period? Yes, I think we are in for an unfortunate alignment of circumstances with the debt ceiling going to emerge when the macro data really takes a step south. So the bond market, as you pointed out, has been very optimistic. I just want to remind viewers here that last summer or last spring, the bond market was forecasting the first rate cut now. Yes, for February of 2023. And obviously we're very far away from that. So I would caution viewers again to look at the bond market's assumptions and rethink whether indeed they think inflation and growth comes down at a pace that allows, gives political cover to the Fed to undo some of the rate hikes they've done over the past year. Final word on the debt ceiling. What did I want to talk about? A lot of the macro data. Yes, US economic data has been pretty decent so far, particularly the fourth quarter of last year. But when you look at a lot of other indicators that are forward looking, it suggests we're about ahead for a much stronger slowdown than anticipated. And obviously there's a lot of noise in the market with every data point that comes out. Which factors are you focusing on when you're trying to determine the path, not just that the Fed might take, but perhaps the sort of recession that might be ahead as well? Well, there's no great mystery here. This is the usual stuff. I would say some of us economists look a little bit more at indicators that have had, let's say, a better track record in terms of forecasting recession. So if you look at jobs numbers, for instance, the continuing job claims have had a much better predictive power in terms of future economic cycles. And there, for instance, we hit a critical threshold towards the end of the last year, which is that continuing job claims are up only about 14% off their lows. Now, that may not sound like much, particularly because in absolute numbers they're still pretty low. But whenever those numbers have gone up by that extent, that has usually brought a recession. Or put it this way, every recession has been preceded by that type of jump within the six to nine months beforehand. So again, that's just one example on the jobs front. If you look at inflation, if you disentangle the inflation numbers, you see that particularly wage-related inflation is still very sticky. Services-related inflation, very sticky. It does not look like the whole disinflation wave that is supposed to basically precede the rate cuts is really taking hold in critical areas of the inflation metrics. And we know, of course, the Fed will be keeping an eye on that employment data. But as we look at other central banks, what we've seen in the ECB also coming out this week, as well as the Bank of England, how are those expectations differing? Obviously, they have different pressures as a result of what they saw with their energy crunch. Well, they have divine intervention in support of their actions. What do I mean? Obviously, one thing we were all worried about was the nature of the winter in Europe. And that obviously has passed, at least from an economic point of view, passed incredibly well, well above expectations. And so basically, it's not an equal distribution curve of outcome.","Elliot Hentoff warns that the ongoing debate on the debt ceiling and economic data may lead to a volatile market period. He suggests that investors reassess bond market assumptions and focus on better recession forecasting indicators. Meanwhile, ECB and Bank of England have taken divine intervention to support their actions due to the unusually harsh winter in Europe."
32,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtOzuuCXLJ0,qtOzuuCXLJ0," Well, fears of Bitcoin's price action pull into view. The digital asset's long-term trend hangs in the balance as the Fed's next rate hike decision fast approaches. Here with more on what to watch for Bitcoin is Yahoo Finance's own Jarrod Booker. Hey, Jarrod. Hey there. It is all about the Fed. And well, this is what's happened over the last 24 hours. Let's get a quick look of what happened over the weekend. And why did I say all about the Fed when we're talking crypto? That is because crypto is very levered to the Fed's balance sheet and to its money printing operations to monetary policy in general. So here's Bitcoin up a whopping half a percent over the last three days. But here's what it's done year to date. Now up almost 40 percent. We haven't seen a January like this since way back in 2013. And let me just show you what was happening back then. So this is a max chart. This goes back to what, 2009. Now back in 2013, you're not even be able to see the line. We did have a huge run up for about four months, I believe. And is it going to look anything like this? Well, what I want to focus on is this huge peak that we had back here in 2017. That was a high of 20,000. Now they say markets have price history, price memory, excuse me. And we can see that playing out. In fact, we dip below 20,000. You might call this potentially a false breakdown. Why false? Because if the direction is now up, that would be a little bit of a scare to the downside that we often see in in technical trading here. Now the point is we could be on the upswing here, but we have some obstacles. Now let me show you a Yahoo Finance chart. I pulled this from our website, a little bit of copy and paste here. What I wanted to what I wanted to show here, this is a free indicator called volume profile. This tells you all the volume that has been transacted at a given price level. So this goes back two years. This is the top here at almost 79,000 and right here. This is 30,000. So this line right here is a huge area and you can see indeed that most of the volume is concentrated between 30 and 60,000. Now we're also coming off a very, very strong base. The fact that this line right here at 20,000 is this big probably means that that's a very good support and we would not want to see that violated should prices come down again. Suffice to say, once we get above 25,000 should be smooth sailing to 30,000, but that's where the rubber meets the road. So this Wednesday with the Fed is going to be very important. As I said, these crypto assets tend to lead the Fed, tend to lead stocks and bonds more than anything else. It is what it is. So on Fed Day at 2.30 p.m. when Chair Powell takes the lectern, I'm going to be watching Bitcoin to see where we might be ending the day with stocks.","Bitcoin's price is highly dependent on the Federal Reserve's monetary policy, with a 40% increase seen this year. The key support level remains at 20,000, and reaching 30,000 faces obstacles."
33,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PM9FRudEvMc,PM9FRudEvMc," Markets anticipating the Fed's next moves and so far they've given no hints they'll let up on the fight against inflation. Here with a summary of what to watch, Yahoo! finances Jennifer Schoenberger. Hey Jen, a big week. Good morning to you. That's right, a big week indeed. The Federal Reserve kicking off its first policy meeting of the year Tuesday where it is widely expected to slow down the pace of rate hikes while looking at how much further it needs to raise rates ultimately this year after three months of slowing inflation. Here are three things to watch. Number one, a 25 basis point rate hike. A chorus of Fed officials have signaled a quarter point rate hike at this meeting, which would mark a further slowdown in pace from the half a percentage point hike seen in December. Markets are pricing in a nearly 100% chance that this happens. That would bring the policy rate to a range of four and a half to four and three quarters, marking the highest levels since October 2007. The Fed wants to slow down the pace of rate hikes to assess the impact on the economy so far and see how much higher they need to raise the policy rate to continue bringing down inflation. Number two, how much further will the policy rate rise and when could the Fed pause? Read the Fed's statement closely and see whether they leave in language that quote ongoing increases in rates, emphasis on plural there, will be required. Also listen to comments from Fed Chair Powell during the press conference since there won't be any new interest rate projections this meeting. Most Fed officials estimated in December that the policy rate would need to rise to a peak between five and five and a quarter, implying about two more quarter point increases. Number three, what does Fed Chair Powell say about financial conditions? The Fed has said any easing in financial conditions will make it harder for them to do their job and could require further rate hikes. If you look at the yield on the 10-year Treasury and the level on the S&P, they're about roughly where they were mid-December, perhaps a hair higher when the Fed met last. Some officials have talked about the potential to raise rates even after the Fed pauses if financial conditions loosen or inflation remains high. Watch to see whether Fed Chair Powell will say the same thing. Now, Rochelle, I just want to point out one other major data point that Fed officials are closely watching tomorrow morning is the employment cost index. This is important because it is an indicator of wage growth, which they believe is feeding into inflation. Now depending on where that number comes in, it probably won't change the calculus for a 25 basis point rate hike, but could have implications for how they see things going forward.","Federal Reserve expected to slow down rate hikes, markets anticipate 25 basis point increase. Chair Powell's comments on financial conditions to be closely watched. Market expectations suggest a nearly 100 percent chance of this happening, which would raise the policy rate to a range of four and a half to four and three quarters, marking the highest levels since October 2007.

34,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GelgEFy0tdU,GelgEFy0tdU," Spotify is set to report fourth quarter earnings on Tuesday before the opening bell. Yahoo Finance reporter Ali Kanal is here with what we can expect from the music streamer. Ali, what are you expecting? Hi, Rochelle. Spotify had a really rough 2022 with the stock losing more than two thirds of its value. And if you look at the stock performance, since we saw that record high in February 2021, the stock is still down about 65%. So investors are really going to be focused on this earnings report to see if there are any improvements when it comes to profitability along with gross margins. Now here are top and bottom line expectations and reminder that Spotify does report in earnings estimates revenue coming in at roughly 3.2 billion euro on an adjusted loss of roughly 130 a share total monthly active users. That's expected to tick higher to reach 479 million on a premium subscriber basis. Those numbers expected to grow 7 million in the quarter to reach 202 million with ad supported users estimated to come in at about 287 million. That would be a 14 million jump compared to Q3. But again, I think the main focus here is going to be on gross margins. Those numbers did disappoint in the third quarter, sending shares down about 13% following the results. When it comes to Q4, those numbers are pretty muted in comparison to Q3. Current estimates calling for around 24.5%. So anything less than that, you will likely see a major sell off. And really, this is a narrative that Spotify has been grappling with for quite some time. Really solid top line growth, really solid subscriber numbers. But those medium to long term investments, especially when we think about podcasting, that's just been hammering the bottom line. And investors, they don't have the patience for it anymore. I mean, when you think about how podcasting especially blew up during the pandemic when people were under lockdown, different story now. So, I mean, will Spotify be forced to pivot that growth at all cost strategy in order to reach those profitability targets? That certainly seems to be the vibe over these past few weeks heading into earnings, especially after last week when we saw Spotify lay off 6% of its workforce restructure the business. Dawn Ostrov, who led that podcast division, she will now be stepping down. And it seems like Spotify is finally starting to understand that it's very expensive to create original programming. It's very expensive to lure these high profile celebrities for podcasting. I mean, if you look at some of these deals, we're talking hundreds of millions of dollars for deals with Joe Rogan, Kim Kardashian. So there needs to be a better way. Spotify has been developing advertising technology for audio so it can take advantage of those ad dollars. The company did reiterate to Yahoo Finance that 2022 was that peak investment year and that in 2023, you'll start to see incremental improvements on profitability, on operating income. But this is going to be a long term effort and investors really, really want to see improvements. So I think we're going to see a pivot in this podcasting strategy. And I also think I know subscribers don't want to hear this, but I do think we could see some price hikes, especially with YouTube premium and Apple Music recently hiking prices as well. So we'll see if we get any of those announcements on the earnings call tomorrow morning for Spotify Q4 results.","Investors are keen on Spotify's Q4 earnings report, looking for signs of improved profitability and gross margins. The company may need to pivot its growth strategy and reconsider its costly podcasting investments, potentially leading to price hikes for subscribers. The fourth quarter earnings report for Spotify is anticipated to be released, with expectations for revenue around 3.2 billion Euro and an adjusted loss of roughly 130 Euro per share. The total monthly active users are projected to increase to 479 million, including 202 million premium subscribers and an estimated 287 million ad-supported users. The focus will be on Gross margins, as they disappointed in the previous quarter, and estimates for Q4 are approximately 24.5 Euro. The company has experienced significant challenges due to costly podcasting investments, including layoffs and restructuring. Investors are eager to witness improvements in profitability and operating income in 2023, potentially involving a shift in the podcasting strategy and potential price adjustments for subscribers."
35,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeWvAWsR568,IeWvAWsR568," Ford's new EV supply chain is coming online and the company is ramping up production of its Mustang Mark E to help reduce customer wait times and take advantage of streamlined costs to reduce prices across the board. The move prices Ford's Mark E more competitively against Tesla which recently cut prices as well. For more on the EV market, let's go to Yahoo Finance's Price to Bremenian. Good for consumers, I know they like to hear these price cuts coming in. Everyone loves price cuts but Rochelle, really the big news here is this is all in response to Tesla cutting prices of that Mustang Mark E here. You know, from as little as $600 to $6,000 for certain models. Now you have four models below that very, very, very important $55,000 IRA price tax cap that you need to get that big tax credit. So that's a huge deal for Ford there. Ford said in a statement though, we're not going to cede ground to anyone. A very strong statement there because they're basically talking about Tesla there, right? So strong words but will it be enough to sort of compete? Like you mentioned, Ford also boosts production. They didn't say by how much but I want to note that they sold around 40,000 Mark E's last year. So I imagine looking at least double that capacity by 2023. And you know, people are always looking for things like new models. We haven't seen any new models from Tesla in a while but then when you look at the prices, some of it might be apples to oranges depending on how different they are. But how do the prices for the new Mark E compare to Tesla's vehicles? So after the price cuts, the most compelling sort of trim here for the Ford Mustang Mark E is the, it's called the E all wheel drive premium model that compares, that costs around $54,000. That compares very favorably to the standard model Y long range, which is around the same price. Both are all wheel drive. Both will qualify for that $55,000 price tax credit. So that's probably where the battleground is for Ford versus Tesla. But Tesla has a secret weapon in the sense that their seven seat trim versions qualify for an $80,000 price cap for the IRA. So if you add that $4,000 seven seater trim selection for your model Y, you get that higher price cap for the tax cuts and that means you can buy more expensive versions of Tesla's cars which are then better for Tesla from a margin point of view. So definitely keeping that in mind, sort of doing the math here to work out what ends up better for you and your tax breaks. Also want to talk Toyota, still selling more cars than anyone else. What's the story there? Yeah, you know, they globally, they eked out a win over Volkswagen. I think it's the third year in a row they've been the number one car seller in the world. You know, it's sort of like a, it's a good thing to kind of have as a feather in your hat, but when we're talking about margin shrinking component crises, it's actually hard to sort of execute and get that, take that crown away. So you know, Volkswagen is sort of coming on their heels and Toyota had to actually, they've changed up their CEO, they switched over CEOs now because they're kind of behind the game in terms of EVs. They haven't been selling them in EVs at all. They sell a lot of hybrids, which are very competitive, very, very in demand for consumers still. So in a good spot for Toyota here, but I think that down the line, I don't think they really want to be that number one model, the one number one builder because it's too much pressure there to actually perform when you're trying to actually boost prices and boost margins in this kind of changing world in the autos. It's changing fast after they took the crown from GM. But interesting to see what happens when they do really make that push into the EV space. That's Romanian. Thanks so much.",Ford is responding to Tesla's price cuts by ramping up production of the Mustang Mark E and reducing prices. Toyota is still the top-selling car brand globally but lags behind in the EV market.
36,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3FC-wA4nQY,L3FC-wA4nQY," All eyes are on Apple this week as the $2 trillion company releases its first quarter earnings report. Investors and analysts will be looking to see just how much the recent COVID lockdowns in China's iPhone City have disrupted production. Layoffs across the tech sector have rocked an already jittery Wall Street and while Apple has so far managed to avoid eliminating jobs this year, investors are bracing for a tough report. Wall Street isn't anticipating much to celebrate as it expects Apple to post lower earnings and revenue than it did a year ago. Apple's stock price has outperformed much of its big tech competitors over the past year. As of January 27th, it's down about 8% in the past 12 months while Microsoft's share price is down 17% and Google parent Alphabet is down 23%. But despite Apple's performance relative to the broader tech sector, shareholders voted to cut CEO Tim Cook's pay by more than 40% to $49 million this year. A move quickly followed by Google CEO Sundar Pichai who also announced a pay cut following his company's decision to lay off 12,000 of its employees. And to its credit, Apple has managed to avoid large-scale layoffs unlike its peers, partly because Apple's headcount grew at a slower pace than other tech giants over the course of the pandemic. According to the Wall Street Journal, Apple's workforce grew by 20% between September 2019 and September 2022. During that same period, Microsoft's headcount increased 53%, Meta's 94%, and Amazon's workforce more than doubled. And that rapid growth, experts say, is what's driving cutbacks across the industry. We're seeing it across tech. These companies were spending like 1980s rock stars at a pace that was unsustainable. But the iPhone maker isn't without its own issues. Throughout November and December of 2022, Apple faced significant headwinds from COVID lockdowns and worker protests at manufacturer Foxconn's facility in Zhengzhou, China. The plant, which employs 200,000 workers, produces the bulk of Apple's iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max handsets. The iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max, which start at $999 and $1099, are two of Apple's most important devices. Their steeper prices help boost the average iPhone selling price, driving higher revenue and margins for the tech giant. According to IDC's Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker, shipments of Apple's iPhone fell 14.9% in the fourth quarter of 2022, down from 85 million units in Q4 2021 to 72.3 million units. But it's not just the iPhone that's faced trouble. During Apple's Q4 earnings call, Apple's CFO Luca Maestri said that Apple expects nearly 10 percentage points of negative year over year impact from the strong dollar. What's more, Maestri said he expects Mac revenue to decline substantially year over year and expects services revenue to grow but face those currency challenges as well. And while many investors sense trouble for Apple and others in the tech sector, some analysts are seeing signs of optimism in the months ahead.","Apple's Q1 earnings report is expected to show lower earnings and revenue, with production disruptions due to COVID lockdowns in China's iPhone City as a likely factor. Apple has avoided large-scale layoffs, but faced worker protests at manufacturer Foxconn's facility in China. Despite its relative outperformance in the tech sector, Apple's CEO Tim Cook's pay was reduced by over 40 percent. Apple avoided large-scale layoffs due to slower workforce growth compared to other tech giants. Shipments of iPhones fell 14.9 percent in Q4 2022 compared to the previous year. Apple anticipates negative year-over-year impact from the strong dollar, expects Mac Revenue to decline, and Services Revenue to face currency challenges. Some analysts see signs of optimism despite challenges in the tech sector."
37,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_Hd44edN0s,u_Hd44edN0s," Well, it's been two years since meme stocks became a thing. It started in January of 2021 with investors buying up shares of video game retailer GameStop. Retail traders would also get on to buying shares of AMC and Bed Bath and Beyond at wild rates. Yahoo! Finance's Inez Ferre got to speak to some of these traders who were reflecting on the meme stock craze and probably not feeling so good about it, huh, Inez? Yeah, that's right, Dave. Some lost. Some did, though, see some gains. I will say that one Reddit user reached out anonymous to me and said, look, I bought 100 shares of AMC at around $8.50. Then he sold them at $35.55. He saw this cult-like phenomenon building around GameStop and AMC. But then I spoke to another retail trader who sells stock-related merchandise online, and he said that he bought AMC thinking it would be the next Tesla. He said to me, I was so stressed. I lost so much money that my wife threatened to divorce me. Now, luckily, they're still together. They went through that rough patch. But nonetheless, look, some people definitely lost money with this. We reached out to Vanda Research that showed us this chart that you're seeing right there. And that's a net buying for GME, AMC, and Bed Bath and Beyond since January of 2021. The peak for GME was around January 27th of 2021, the day before some brokerage firms had temporarily halted the buy button, remember, for GME and some other stocks as well. Certainly, these stocks have gone through volatility in 2021, 2022 as well. Will we see another meme wave the way we've seen with these going forward? Well, I spoke to Vanda Research and said, look, we struggle to see how that will happen, to how these levels will be revived to those 2020-2021 levels, mainly because stimulus checks are gone. You've got a tighter monetary policy. Most retail trader portfolios are down about 35% on average. And they've noticed that as a P&L has worsened, activity has also waned as well. A meme stock love story. I really think that that has a nice ring to it, Inez. We might want to make a little reality show out of that. I think there's potential. Inez Ferre, thanks so much. Enjoy the weekend.","Yahoo! Finance reports on the ups and downs of meme stocks, with some retail traders seeing profits and others experiencing losses. Vanda Research predicts a resurgence is unlikely due to tighter policies and decreased retail trader activity.  It mentions a Reddit user who made gains selling AMC shares from $8.50 to $35.55. Vanda Research data shows net buying trends for GME, AMC, and Bed Bath and Beyond since January 2021, with GME peaking around January 27, 2021. Retail traders' portfolios are down about 35% on average, and the meme stock activity has declined due to factors such as the end of stimulus checks and tighter monetary policy."
38,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nARObvoWymM,nARObvoWymM," US employees are getting more disgruntled. A recent Gallup poll finding that employee engagement, which had its first year-over-year dip in a decade in 2021, fell again last year, going from 36 percent in 2020 to 34 percent in 2021 and then falling to 32 percent in 2022. This is for full-time and part-time employees. The poll also finding that 18 percent of workers are actively disengaged at work and active disengagement actually ticked up six points since 2020. The ratio of engaged to actively disengaged workers is at the lowest rate that we've seen since 2013. Indeed, this is concerning when you take into account workers right now. Employers are doing everything they can to keep the workers that they have because of the fact that the labor market is so competitive. It's hard to hire for the jobs that you need and those quit rates keep rising. They're incredible when you take a look at the labor market, what those numbers are on a month-over-month basis, and this is a very worrisome trend for employers. Yeah, but employers don't seem to understand that the world has changed. We've all changed, and yes, like everything else, that's because of COVID. The expectations of workers are different now, and employers have no idea what to do with that. It's not simply using buzzwords that HR passed down to them that pass on to their employees. They have to learn to be different, to actually engage those employees, to create a different atmosphere, and to be, uh, acknowledge the fact that mental health now is of utmost importance. At first glance, Shauna, my guess was this was largely generational. It is the best correlation. Young people are more burnt out, are more disengaged than old people because their expectations are frankly different than older people who worked 20, 30 years ago and have a different expectation. It's not as simple as remote work versus fully in office, though, and that was surprising to me. The biggest correlation was among those people whose jobs could be fully remote but were actually fully back in the office. That was the most disengaged group. I thought you needed to be in the office to be truly engaged. The numbers don't bear that out. The numbers certainly don't bear that out, especially when you take a look at those productivity numbers really showing that you can be even more productive when you're working from home. You're not worried about commuting into the office, and a lot of people are much happier about that. Clearly, employers need to make some changes if they want to keep the employees that they currently have. They don't know how. Those numbers, they need to figure it out quickly, that's for sure.","US employee engagement has decreased, with only 32% of workers engaged and 18% disengaged, the lowest rate since 2013. Employers need to make changes to retain their workers."

You can see it nearly doubled in price, still up almost 50%. And that was after seven volatility halts and the news, the Saudi private public investment fund thinking of buying out the EV maker, the Tesla competitor. They already own two-thirds of it and while we haven't heard any rumors of funding secured just yet, if this sounds a little bit familiar, guess what? The Saudis were the ones who were supposedly about to buy Tesla back in the day and we know how that trial is ongoing right now. Suffice to say this is a SPAC that came to market under a lot of excitement, got caught up in the meme stock mania two years ago. Here it is today, up 33%, guys.","Nasdaq performs well while Intel's drop in earnings causes concern for chipmakers.

40,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRRaL1O2MwU,dRRaL1O2MwU," Time now for old people talking about Gen Zers. Adobe is out with a new survey talking about Gen Z in the workplace. Gen Z expected to account for 30% of the U.S. workforce by 2030, that's according to Adobe. And they have unique challenges ahead of them with fears of a recession and the pandemic-led rise in remote work. 70% surveyed say they are worried about a recession. Many of the college students and recent grads say they are saving money ahead of a possible downturn. And Dave, those macroeconomic factors are clearly having an impact because 67% in this survey say that those macro factors have influenced or will influence their job choice when it comes to picking an industry or a company. 55% will look at a company's financial outlook before applying. 75% say they are less likely to apply without a disclosed salary range. We know that's a very popular topic of discussion. This one was a little surprising considering the appeal of remote work. 75% say they would be willing to relocate to be closer to work. Clearly they are emphasizing that Gen Z does see a value of coming into the office. I think the big question there is how many days they really want to come into the office. Most likely they probably want some sort of hybrid situation. Another stat that did stick out to me was the startup and how only 16% say they would pursue a role with a startup or a small size company. I'm a millennial but I know there was so much excitement when I came out of college of people wanting to work in a startup. And that was in the middle of the recession, of the great recession. Still startups were attractive. A lot of people found that the growth that you could have there, the experience that you could get, it was willing to take that risk. That certainly does not seem to be the case now. Maybe they learned from our mistakes. I'm out of recessionary fears and of course I'm the Gen X here. So as far as the willing to relocate closer to a job, I think young people regardless of what generation they're labeled with, they don't have a lot of attachments. They don't really care to be home all the time. In fact they want a more social environment. They want to have happy hour. So that probably all lends itself to being in the office. And hopefully they want to learn in their first job because that is all you want to do in that first job is really learn for the job that comes after it. As for the rest of that entire survey, I'm curious to see how that changes over the next 12 months because if in fact their recessionary fears do come true, they won't be as empowered as clearly they are in that survey. They won't have those choices. They won't have that flexibility. They won't have the strength to argue for these things. So that is really a representation of how tight the labor market is right now. And that dynamic may soon change. I think really the most interesting trend we're seeing among that group is wage and salary transparency. And I think that's going to be better for all of them and quite frankly I hope for all of us. Yeah, I think so too. And I also think it's important to point out that those salary ranges, while there has been increased transparency, some of the ranges that are posted are mind boggling. There was one what, $90,000 to $900,000 didn't really do you any favors just in terms of narrowing down what you should be paid or what you could be paid in that role. But again, I think the step towards more salary transparency and people also, especially the younger generation, are more prone to talking about it. They think you should be talking about salary transparency. So again, a huge focal point here for Gen Z when they're looking for a job.","Gen Z faces challenges of recession fears and remote work, according to an Adobe survey. 75% want wage and salary transparency, and 67% say macroeconomic factors impact their job choices, while 55 percent consider a company's financial outlook before applying. Salary transparency is crucial, as 85 percent are less likely to apply without a disclosed salary range. Despite the appeal of remote work, 75 percent are willing to relocate for work. Only 16 percent are interested in pursuing roles with startups or small companies.

41,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7XgBj7ISA,tf7XgBj7ISA," All right, well, do you earn enough to be in the top 1% tax bracket of your state? A new study from Smart Asset ranking all 50 states from lowest to highest income needed to be in that top 1% of each state. Coming in at number one, your home state, Dave, Connecticut. You have to make around $955,000 to be in the top 1% of taxpayers there. Connecticut is followed by Massachusetts, New Jersey, my home state, New York, and California. In all of these states, you need to make over $800,000 a year to be considered in that top 1%. My goodness, those are astounding numbers for ordinary Americans just watching this. $900,000. And when I look at that top five, there's really a fundamental disconnect that I see. It's really untethered from what you would assume, because my assumption would be that these would be highly performing economies. Not at all the case. I love my state. Connecticut is a wonderful place to live. However, at best, it's middle of the pack. U.S. News has it as the 22nd ranked economy in the United States. Now, California is the one that stands out to me. Massachusetts, a pretty solid economy. California, no, in the top 10. But New York and New Jersey. New Jersey is the 33rd overall ranked economy, according to U.S. News. And New York is 43rd. So again, really untethered to the success of that state's economy shows how giant the wealth gap is in Connecticut, New York, and New Jersey, the tri-state area. Yeah, certainly a massive wealth gap. And like you're saying, when you compare it to the average, what Americans are making, the average American household earns an median income of under $70,000. So $70,000 compared to over $900,000, the top 1% in your state, obviously a massive, massive gap there. And Connecticut, I mentioned their economy losing Lego headquarters today to Massachusetts, one of those states on the list. And most of us cannot relate to those numbers. Let's look at the other end of the income bracket. And well, still pretty hard to relate to these numbers as well. But these are the bottom five, depending on how you look at it. The top 1% states, Kentucky, Arkansas, New Mexico, Mississippi, and West Virginia is number one or number 50, depending on how you look at it. But still, to be in the top 1% in West Virginia, $375,000 a year. Now, on the flip side of my observation with the top five, these are really tethered to, largely speaking, underperforming economies. West Virginia, Mississippi, Kentucky, and Arkansas, all in the bottom 10 of that U.S. News ranking of states' economies. Those are states that have been struggling, economically speaking, for a number of years. So that, on the bottom end, makes a little bit more sense. Still, an extraordinary amount of money. It certainly is. And less than 10% of all households earn more than $200,000, which is far below West Virginia there, which ranked fifth, which is just below $400,000. So clearly, there is a massive disconnect, a massive wealth gap, like you were talking about when you compare really all 50 states, what we're seeing, the average numbers there, comparing that to the average household, the American household, what they take home every year. It's no surprise that so many Americans are being hurt so drastically by inflation and with no relief really in sight. It's a very, very tough economy here for at least the next couple of quarters. I'm sure there's some people in that top 1%, but that is depressing seeing those numbers. It's very depressing. Knowing how far you are away from the top 1%. Yeah, and you're up against the stiffest competition out there in Connecticut.","Smart Asset's study ranks all 50 US states based on the income needed to be in the top 1% of taxpayers, with Connecticut coming in first and West Virginia last. The wealth gap between the top 1% and average American households is concerning. Connecticut is ranked first, requiring around $955,000 for the top 1% taxpayers. Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, and California follow, all needing over $800,000 annually to be in the top 1%. These figures reflect a significant wealth gap, especially when compared to the average American household income of under $70,000. On the other end, the bottom five states with the lowest 1% income thresholds are Kentucky, Arkansas, New Mexico, Mississippi, and West Virginia, with West Virginia requiring $375,000 annually. These states generally have underperforming economies, adding to the wealth disparity. Less than 10% of households earn more than $200,000, highlighting the disconnect between the top 1% and average incomes. "
42,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXfXCRKumew,RXfXCRKumew," Despite companies so far largely beating expectations for the fourth quarter, the softening S&P 500 earnings backdrop still spells trouble for stocks, according to a recent RBC Capital Markets report. Where may investors be looking to and where may the market be headed? We're here to discuss this. Neil Shah, Edison Group Director of Research. Good to see you, Neil. So as we're seeing here, I mean, this is a better cue for earnings season so far, as you said in your note, than you expected. But what do you attribute that to? I think that the consumer has been more robust than a lot of people feared, particularly around the holiday season. And it varies by region. So you're seeing signs that actually Europe is fared a lot better than perhaps the US has. And, you know, last time I was on the show, you know, I think there was a lot of nervousness about how Q4 ended. We've come into January, a lot of companies reporting actually positive trading updates. And I think that that's being reflected in a buoyant market that we're seeing today. And, Neil, you are saying that we're currently in a sweet spot between easing inflationary pressures and corporate earnings potentially deteriorating. So then how should investors approach this period? It's tricky. I mean, I think this year is going to be a tricky year for investors. I was reading one Investment Houses note and their assessment was that the portfolio you want for the next six to nine months is very different to the portfolio you want for a decade of investing. And you've got to make up your mind how long term you want to be in your positioning. Right now what we're seeing is that all the sectors that kicked you in 2022, you know, have been kissing you in 2023. Whether you want to be in those stocks long term, I think is a big question, Mark. So we've seen a rotation out of, for example, consumer staples until you can see the discretionary. There might be some good reasons for that. We can talk about some of the themes we're looking at. But I think that you need to be reasonably nimble as we are in this market. You can participate in the market. And I think you want to be rotating in and out of sectors. And Neil, speaking of those key themes that you're going to be watching this year, baby boomers wealth, geopolitical tensions, industrial automation, natural resources and oil. Which one do you think has, I guess, the most propensity to do the most damage to markets or to really shift the narrative this year? I think, look, there's, you know, my view is that the winners of the last decade will be very different to the winners of the next decade. I think we're seeing a pivot in the market. We started to see that rotation out of long duration growth stocks as rates started going up into old school economy names, particularly, you know, capital markets. Companies with real assets, cash flowing businesses, people looking for dividend yields and, you know, old school industrial names, where the valuations were slightly more attractive. Now, looking forward, some of the things that I would look to play are that I don't think I think that you're going to find upside surprises in certain sectors. So let's let's touch on this idea of, you know, you've seen actually consumer discretionary, particularly in Europe, outpaced consumer staples. One of the things that we're starting to see is that the baby boomer generation, who is coming up for retirement, is a massive pool of wealth. Well, he's not necessarily passing it on to the next generation. You know, I think this this COVID impact has meant that people are looking to treat themselves, spoil themselves a little bit, and you're starting to see them spend on some of the top performing sectors. So, you know, travel, leisure has done reasonably well. And that's a theme that I think you can start to you may look to play. I think it's early days, so you want to see some points validating that. But luxury goods, for instance, is an area where I think there's quite a lot of interest. I also think that the geopolitical environment is one which is going to persist. You know, we've got this situation in Russia. China's coming out of its lockdown, but I think, you know, that's going to remain an issue for the markets over the next 12 months. And one of the things I think, you know, policymakers are going to be focusing on more than ever is energy security. One of the things we're looking to play is the switch of energy from east to west to actually north to south. So the fields, the energy fields in Africa and Northern Europe, start to take much more of a sort of strategic importance. And we're starting to look for points of value in companies operating in these areas. So I think I think it's very much the nature of what I'm discussing is it's a stock pickers market. You need to find interesting long term themes that are going to contribute to growth that outpaces inflation, that offsets a depressed demand environment. And it's worth participating in the market. But I don't think that you could just, you know, buy a general ETF. I think you'll struggle if you do that. I think you need to find interesting plays in the market. So it sounds like a more targeted approach, as you're mentioning there. And I want to talk about a trend that you mentioned, because you're talking about this orderly deflation of assets that we're going to see. We saw it last year with tech and some of these longer duration ones. But this year, you're expecting private equity and real estate to be more in focus. How do you see that unfolding? I mean, you know, it's the Warren Buffett thing of, you know, when the tide goes out, you'll see who's swimming naked. It is, you know, a lot of private equity firms, for instance, you know, will have invested in things. Those where, you know, they've invested using financial engineering are likely to be caught up because it's getting more costly to borrow. And I think that the other possibility of write downs is there. Those who do the harder thing of actually improving the assets that they're investing in potentially stand a chance. So I think that the private equity sector is going to see some pressure in terms of, you know, the values of its holdings, etc. Are you going to see write downs? And a lot of the focus this year is going to be on that sector. I think it's going to be a slightly more challenging environment. Real estate is in a similar kind of situation. Rates are going up. You're already starting to see weakness in the housing market, but I think you're going to start back to see that more broadly in the commercial real estate sector. And again, I'd focus on are you going to start to see the possibility of some write downs in that sector? The main thing I focus on is that it's not panic. I think it's an orderly adjustment of valuations to a new environment. And I would, for the reasons I've set out, I'd be cautious about those two sectors because I think those are going to come into focus this year. Everyone certainly has to do their homework in this environment. A big thank you there to Neil Shaw, Edison Group Director of Research. Thank you for your time this morning.","RBC Capital Markets report suggests S&P 500 earnings are softening, posing trouble for stocks.

43,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3eEQUrU_0SQ,3eEQUrU_0SQ," As the price of eggs increases here in the U.S., so do the attempts to bring raw eggs and poultry across the U.S.-Mexico border. That's according to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Our Brock DePalma is here with the details. Didn't see this coming. This was not on my 2023 bingo card. This was not on the bingo card for me either, Rochelle. Of course, the price of eggs are up 59.9% year over year, up 11.1% month over month in December of 2022, according to the latest CPI data. And it turns out people are doing all that they can to get eggs for cheaper. In a statement to Yahoo Finance from a U.S. Customs and Border Protection official in El Paso, he said, quote, we are seeing an increase in people attempt to cross eggs from Juarez to El Paso because they are, quote, unquote, significantly less expensive in Mexico than the U.S. This is also occurring with added frequency at other southwest border locations as well. He said, while many headlines are saying that travelers are smuggling the raw eggs and poultry, he said most are actually declaring them during the primary inspection without consequence. Now, if, however, they are discovered during an inspection, that's when a $300 civil penalty comes into play and they're then seized from the traveler. But another U.S. border official tweeting over the weekend in San Diego that in response to not declaring those eggs prior to an inspection, they can result in penalties up to $10,000. Now, of course, this comes as the toll of the avian flu outbreak is causing those prices to soar here in the U.S. Per the U.S. DA, a total of 57 million birds have been wiped out, resulting in those higher prices that we're seeing across the U.S. Of course, some stores even seeing as high as $6, even maybe $7 to $8 for just a dozen of eggs. I mean, well, at least the lesson here is declare them, you know, don't end up paying more in fines than you would for the eggs in the first place. So then, Brooke, will Americans expect to see relief anytime soon? Well, according to the U.S. DA, inventory is on the rise and therefore prices should then fall. Of course, this is going to take time. As I'm speaking to farmers across the U.S., they really say that because they had to, unfortunately, destroy part of their fleet, part of those laying hens that produce these eggs, it'll take into perhaps the second half of 2023, even into 2024, in order to restock that fleet of egg laying hens and then ultimately get more eggs produced and to market. And therefore, when we see that happen, then the egg prices will fall. So it's not going to happen right away, Michelle. We may see more wonky stories like this happen as Americans look to cut corners. But as of right now, it's going to take time.","Rising egg prices have led to an increase in smuggling attempts of raw eggs and poultry across the U.S.-Mexico border. U.S. Customs and Border Protection warns of penalties for those who fail to declare the items, with relief not expected until 2023 or 2024.The price of eggs in the U.S has risen by 59.9% year over year and 11.1% month over month in December 2022, according to the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI). There's been an increase in attempts to smuggle raw eggs and poultry from Mexico to the U.S., especially at the U.S.-Mexico border. Most travelers are declaring these items during primary inspection, but if discovered during inspection, a $300 civil penalty is imposed, and the items are seized. Failure to declare eggs prior to inspection can result in penalties of up to $10,000. The avian flu outbreak has led to the loss of 57 million birds, contributing to higher egg prices. Relief is expected to come as egg inventory increases, but it may take until the second half of 2023 or even 2024 for prices to significantly fall due to the time required to restock egg-laying hens and increase egg production."
44,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B439UdYv6ZA,B439UdYv6ZA," Business taxes are set to rise even as the economy shows some weakness, according to a new report from Fox Business. Changes to federal taxes are set to begin in 2023 with a 15% profit-based minimum tax on corporations set to begin this year, part of the Inflation Reduction Act. Still, with many of the changes happening this year, the effects won't be reflected and likewise won't necessarily come due in this year's 2022 tax season. Well, let's continue the conversation now because tax season is approaching, but where are all the accountants? The Wall Street Journal reporting a nationwide shortage of the profession. To cope, firms like Geltrude and Company are hiring overseas workers. Well, joining us with more is Dan Geltrude. Geltrude Company, founder. Good to see you, Dan. So did you ever imagine we would get to this point? How did we get here? No, I didn't. And really, my firm is nothing special in this regard in that we're at a point where it's not just about our ability to grow as a firm. It's about being able to handle the current workload. Over the last two years, 300,000 accountants have left the So that leaves a huge hole here to be filled. And as you know, regulations and rules just keep increasing. So there's more responsibilities on accountants to get their work done, yet we have significantly less people to do the work. So it's really become a problem and the solution really is twofold. First, more use of technology to the greatest extent possible, and then an international solution in trying to bring people on board that can help supplement our US workers. So then Dan, as we talk about technology, then is it about getting more assistance for current accountants? Or is it about more reliance on some of these apps and these other services that are becoming available? Well, I think what's happening here is there is a level of work that certainly can be automated and technology can step into that. However, there is always a human factor in terms of reviewing the work. And then also, there's that consultation piece with clients. It's about strategizing. And that's something that you really can't replace with technology. So there's certainly still a huge demand for accountants throughout the country. It's just a matter of how you use those resources and then how you supplement that with technology, along with international help. And then you call this a crisis and a real threat to capitalism. Why are accountants retiring so quickly? And how might we see this play out? Well, let me go straight to what the potential crisis is. So if you don't have enough accountants to get all the work done, as well as auditors, how does that play out? Well, first and foremost, you start to say, okay, can all the tax returns that need to be filed on a timely basis, can all that work get done? The second piece of that, and perhaps even more potential for damage to the U.S. financial system is what happens if you don't have enough auditors in order to be able to timely file all the SEC filings for all these public companies? Because once there is a crack in the credibility of the work being performed, the timeliness and the quality of the work, what happens? Investors start to question whether they can rely on the financial information that they're seeing for which they're making their investment decisions on. And if we ever get to that point, we're not there yet, but we're moving in that direction, that's when you have a true financial meltdown. And who would you say is most at risk? Is this smaller firms more at risk of this versus some of these bigger institutional companies? Well, actually, it's across the board, whether it's a large international firm or your smaller local firms, everybody is feeling the same pain. So clients are clients. The big firms have big clients and public companies. Certainly, it's a threat there, as I just outlined, related to SEC filings. And then as you go down to the local firms, you expect that your accounting firm or your tax preparer is going to be able to get your taxes filed on time or filed at all. Maybe they just simply can't take on more work. So large or small, this problem has the potential to impact everyone. And then I know we talked solutions, perhaps when it comes to technology, but what about sort of overseas hiring as well? Would that be enough to offset the risk of the shortage of accountants here? Well, it's certainly part of the solution. Is it 100%? No, because what you also have is, is there's so much hiring going on internationally, we're starting to get to the point where are there even enough accountants around the globe. So again, I don't know why people are not drawn to the accounting profession. It's certainly a great profession and a very honorable profession. However, it just seems that people are shying away from it. I mean, to be fair, it doesn't sound like the most glamorous of professions, especially, you know, you see everyone on TikTok, you don't really hear them gravitating towards accountancy, but there you go. There are openings clearly that people should be paying attention to. Dan Galtrude, always good to have you.

45,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gXFihVeSzc,4gXFihVeSzc," President Biden feeling the wind at his back with news of a 2.9% GDP growth. Touting this and recent jobs numbers as evidence that the Biden economic plan is working. Senior columnist Rick Newman taking on that claim in this week's Bidenomics. Rick, good to see you, sir. Are people buying it? Yeah, they are a little bit. We saw an increase or an improvement in consumer confidence this week. I don't think that's because Biden is telling people they can afford to be more confident. I think it's a reaction to falling inflation. But things are looking pretty good. Just go back a year, what we know about how the year began in 2022, we had two quarters in a row where GDP actually contracted a little bit. Some people thought that meant a recession had arrived, but that's not what happened in 2022. Growth for the year came in at 2.2%. Biden gave a speech this week on the economy and he said, look, practically since I came into office, Wall Street analysts have been saying, oh, a recession is coming, a recession is coming, a recession is coming. We've talked about this a million times and it hasn't. So research is not here. Now, what happens with this narrative in 2023? I think Biden's got a kind of window of opportunity here for about three months, but there are a lot of signs that economic data is going to weaken in the first and second quarter of 2023. It's different from a year ago, obviously, because interest rates are higher. That is going to slow the economy. We're getting some forecast for the first quarter of 2023, the one we're in right now, that are around minus 1.5%, so a shrinking economy. But look, we're not going to get that news until late April. And for now, Biden can go around saying things are pretty good and that's exactly what he's doing. And Rick, shifting gears just slightly, Elon Musk can't spend five minutes without talking about him. Met with White House leaders on Capitol Hill only earlier today. I'm also seeing names floated like John Podesta, senior advisor to Joe Biden, Mitch Landrieu, senior advisor and coordinator on infrastructure. What was he talking about with them possibly and what do we know about this? Nobody's saying, but there are two apparent things going on here. So today, Elon Musk met with White House officials probably to talk about electric vehicles and in particular the rollout of a lot of the incentives for green energy, EVs and other types of things, charging network across the country that were in the Inflation Reduction Act that passed over the summer. I think this is important because there was a spat between Elon Musk and President Biden for a while there because every time Biden talked about electric vehicles and EV automakers, mainly he talked about General Motors and Ford and he almost never mentioned Tesla, which really put Elon Musk in a foul mood toward Biden. He called Biden a damp sock puppet on Twitter about a year ago. One of the more interesting Elon Musk tweets and there have been many. He was really just irked that Biden would really not give Tesla any credit. I think Elon Musk was kind of right about that. Tesla still is the leading electric vehicle maker in the United States and some could argue in the world and Biden would get up and talk about GM and Ford because they have unionized plants and Tesla does not have unionized plants. So maybe Elon Musk meeting with the Biden administration is a little bit of rapprochement there. And yesterday, Elon Musk met with Kevin McCarthy, the Republican House speaker and probably talked about Twitter and this whole issue of whether Twitter has been tweeting conservatives unfairly. I do not think Twitter has been treating conservatives unfairly. I think what Twitter did before Elon Musk bought it was they banned the people with the most outrageous comments and many of those turned out to be conservatives. So we will see what Elon Musk is doing there. There are many developments ongoing here. We have been talking about them all week. So I can go on and on about Elon Musk, but you guys probably have other things to look out for. That is okay. We have the entire weekend of FinTwit to look forward to. Thank you for that. The IOU Finance is Rick Newman. Bye, guys.","Biden highlights 2.9% GDP growth and job numbers as evidence of his economic plan's success, but Newman doubts it will continue in 2023. Elon Musk met with White House officials to discuss EVs and green energy incentives, and also met with Kevin McCarthy to discuss Twitter. Consumer confidence has improved, potentially due to falling inflation. In 2022, there were two quarters of GDP contraction, but the year ended with 2.2 percent growth. There's a suggestion that economic data might weaken in the first and second quarters of 2023 due to higher interest rates."
46,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IufL6fL3Xm8,IufL6fL3Xm8," Let's get you up to speed on this afternoon's market action and taking a look at the three major averages still holding on to gains as you can see across the board. You're looking at the Dow up 171 points. You're looking at the S&P up just around six-tenths of a percent, nearly seven-tenths of a percent. The Nasdaq, the outperformer of the day, and that of course has been the story this week. The Dow up for the week up just about 2%. S&P up nearly 3% for the week. The Nasdaq, the outperformer there on track for the best month that we have seen since July. Of course, the big story today being earnings, some of that econ data that we got out this morning, but earnings, Intel really in focus, a large drop there, really what that signals for the rest of the chipmakers. Jared? Yeah, let's get you up to speed on Lucid Motors. This is our EV board and boy, what a lot of green. Now here is Lucid today, up, up and away. You can see it nearly doubled in price, still up almost 50%. And that was after seven volatility halts and the news, the Saudi private public investment fund thinking of buying out the EV maker, the Tesla competitor. They already own two-thirds of it and while we haven't heard any rumors of funding secured just yet, if this sounds a little bit familiar, guess what? The Saudis were the ones who were supposedly about to buy Tesla back in the day and we know how that trial is ongoing right now. Suffice to say this is a SPAC that came to market under a lot of excitement, got caught up in the meme stock mania two years ago. Here it is today, up 33%, guys.","US stock market is up with Dow, S&P, and Nasdaq performing well. Intel's drop in earnings is a concern, and Lucid Motors saw a surge in stock price on rumors of a potential buyout by Saudi's PIF.  The Dow is up 171 points, the S&P is up nearly three percent for the week, and the NASDAQ is the outperformer, on track for its best month since July. Lucid Motors' stock nearly doubled in price, up almost 50 percent, with news of a potential buyout by the Saudi public investment fund, which already owns two-thirds of the company."
47,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAhSupQMY4,yMAhSupQMY4," Well, as we continue with what just happened, lots of food for thought. So Dan, where is your focus for tech in the coming weeks? Yeah, I think a lot of what we have to look at is not just how the services side of things is doing. Obviously, we've discussed Microsoft because of their earnings. We're looking forward to Alphabet and Meta to see how the ad market's going. But I think the bigger question really is Apple's earnings coming up because they're a pure play consumer company. I mean, yes, they have a business side of things where companies like ours will purchase MacBooks, but the vast majority of what they do is sell to consumers. And I think that's going to give us a better sign of where the consumer actually feels they are right now as far as comfort level. Right. The idea of the PC market slowing down. OK, you know, people hold on to their PCs for five, seven years or until it starts spitting dust out the back of it. But I think the iPhone, the sales of things like iPad that signs up for signups for services, I think that's going to give us a better indication than the PC market itself. And I mean, we also have Google's Google Alphabet earnings that are going to be coming out as well February 2nd. And I mean, we have to keep in mind that even though people are they're laying off at the moment, doesn't mean that this speaks necessarily to the health of some of these companies, but perhaps see them more strategically really allocating this capital to other parts of their business. And I know you tapped on a lot of the nuances within the companies. All of them are having that same macroeconomic backdrop within them. When you think of things like China and manufacturing supply chains for Apple versus a slowdown in cloud for companies like Amazon and for Google as well. So it does mean that there are still opportunities. We know that even when it comes to things like cybersecurity, more than 750,000 job openings. So we shouldn't really just couch it in the fact that these are layoffs. People are moving to different parts of the businesses. And, you know, there's obviously still a future. A lot of big tech companies are still hiring just a lot more strategically as they were during the pandemic then. Yeah, I think, you know, I mean, personally, I have a bunch of friends who got into coding during the pandemic. They're still able to find jobs. No problem. So I think that's going to be, you know, the sector is hurting. But does that mean that there's no jobs out there? No, there's other industries that need these people, not just the tech industry. There are tech jobs outside of the tech industry for sure. It's true. Big tech gets all the headlines, but obviously jobs of the future attach to these other industries that still need tech as well.","Upcoming tech earnings from Apple, Google, and Microsoft are the focus of discussion as the market looks for how these companies are adapting to the economic climate and their impact on the job market.It also touches on topics like consumer sentiment, PC market trends, iPhone and iPad sales, Google Alphabet's earnings, layoffs in the tech industry, opportunities in cybersecurity with over 750,000 job openings, and the availability of tech jobs beyond the tech industry."
48,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWG7UDyj4sc,wWG7UDyj4sc," Welcome back to What Just Happened Now on Yahoo Finance. I'm Jared Blickery. And guess what? We're watching job losses mount in the tech sector, but what if tech is now? Who's next? And already we're seeing hints of what's to come with blue chip companies like Dow and 3M announcing layoffs and even toy makers like Hasbro cutting back on staff. So I prepared some graphics today and I did a deep dive using the BLS, that's the Bureau of Labor Statistics own data. And that's the data that we report on a monthly basis coming to you next Friday for those January numbers. Stay tuned for that. But I've started with some of the places where we see the job losses first. Now these are not well, startups and high growth is actually not a BLS category. It encompasses a number of other ones. But I put that in there because we've all seen those big tech headlines. Some of those companies that were raising so many employees are increasing their headcount last year, finally shedding that today. But in general, we're seeing that in manufacturing. Now in manufacturing that can that can cover many of the sectors that we're typically looking at when we talk about stocks. So that could be a PC manufacturer, could be Hasbro, could be toys, could be anything construction as well that has to do with the housing sector. And then the wholesale trade. That's before these products reach the retail market. So all of these tend to be indicators early on, and those will often predate what we call the recession. Now some housekeeping notes here. Recession as broadly defined by Enver, that's the National Bureau of Economic Research. They're the ones who officially declare a recession, but it's always with hindsight. So we don't know in real time if we're actually in one. And when we say recession, that's including the entire American economy, which is a huge, huge place. Within some of these sectors, we can get a more nuanced view of what's going on. So this is where we're seeing those early stage losses. Now in the mid stage, we're going to see that finally trickle down into retail, into financial services, into professional services. So we kind of went from some of the blue collar as well as some of the white collar jobs, because that would be chip manufacturing as well, into the white collar jobs. Although white collar and blue collar could be involved in retail trade. So you can see there's a real mix of different types and categories that we're talking about here. Now at this stage, pretty much we already know we're in a recession. And typically, I was talking about the recession overall for the economy. We would first slip into what's called an industrial recession and an earnings recession. So two quarters of negative earnings back to back, and this might be the first quarter of those, would be an earnings recession. That usually predates the general recession. And also that industrial recession that I was talking about generally occurs somewhat in line with that earnings recession. Now in the late stage, I actually have all these categories here. And in fact, I could further subdivide those into two categories. So in the safe, what I would call the safe industries, and those are the industries that tend to get hit the least or even countercyclical, that would be education and health, government and utilities. Now in these industries, sometimes we see an effect late in the game that could be after the recession has already ended. And sometimes with government ending, we see that increase, the amount of employees will increase into a recession. And that's politicians and Congress trying to make sure that the economy doesn't head into a recession or recovers from it more quickly. So that would be a fiscal response here. But in the late stage, private sector, leisure and hospitality, information, mining and lodging, those all tend to get hit less. Now I should also make the point that we all have different conceptions of recessions based on what we've experienced in our own lifetimes. And in fact, every recession is different. All of us remember the pandemic recession. And in fact, that hit leisure and hospitality the hardest. And that's when everybody took their lumps all at once, basically going back to March 20th, and the economy covered very, very quickly. For the most part, I don't even include that in a lot of my analysis because it was so abrupt and so uncharacteristic. Now I want to show you the last two recessions before that. This goes back all the way to 1999. So this shows the dot com bubble bursting as well as the global financial crisis that was more oriented toward the financial sector and also the housing sector. So just going along here, manufacturing and construction, those tend to get hit the most. Manufacturing is this line right here. And you can see before the recession started, in fact, in 1999, 2000, barely climbed back to positive. Manufacturing had been in secular decline for a couple of decades. Construction, another one that I was mentioning, oftentimes gets pretty hard hit. And then for all the hubbub about the financial services over the global financial crisis, it did not experience as great a dip as some of these other sectors, although for financial services it was uncharacteristically deep. And then this orange line here is hospitality. And you can see it's actually faring pretty well through both of these recessions, not getting hard hit as some of the others. And as I said, we all know that leisure and hospitality happen to get hit the most. So everything is going to be different. But it gets back to the question, where are we at this stage in the game? Everything, all the industries have inflected downwards. All these categories that I've been talking about inflected downwards. They've already peaked in terms of employment as of last year. Two of those have not. But those have to do with the government industry. So a little bit of footnote right there. Are we going to plunge into recession? That's a big question here. We're seeing job losses accelerate to the downside, but we haven't even seen them crack the 1% level. So none of these industries that I've been talking about here has even gone negative just yet. So a little bit of time there. Is that going to happen? That's a big question. And that's what we're going to be talking about in the future. And also none of this has to do with stock type stock timing. So that's going to be up next, perhaps for next Friday, guys. Well, thank you for at least breaking down the signals that people should be looking for if we do start seeing layoffs in those sectors. Great stuff. Jared Blick, are you there for us?","Article analyzes potential implications for a recession based on job losses in various sectors, using Bureau of Labor Statistics data categorized into early, mid, and late-stage job losses."

The chipmaker saw steep declines in its cloud client computing and data center segments in the fourth quarter. It is warning the challenges may persist. The company said its Q1 revenue expectations between $10.5 and $11.5 billion, well below the expected $14 billion. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger joins us now. Pat, always nice to get some time with you here. For those unfamiliar with your story and your background at Intel, how personal is it for you that we're back here and we're still talking about numbers and guidance like this? Well, it's very disappointing, of course, Sazi, and always a pleasure to come on the show with you. But numbers that basically we haven't seen for the company for a decade, projecting losses that we haven't seen for 30 years. It's very difficult. At the same time, hey, I'm committed to see this turnaround through. And we knew it was going to be a hard journey. We knew that we had to navigate through the rebuilding execution, getting our products back, having the technology back, making the long-term investments to do so. And hey, I sure would have liked to do so not through such a harsh economic cycle affecting our industry this way. But these are the cards that we're dealt with. We have a tough environment. We're going to keep making those long-term strategic investments, but with a lot more austerity in the core business in the near term. And that's what we laid out for Q1, a very tough pitcher, but one that I'm confident that we'll navigate through and we'll make the company better as a result. Pat, make the pitch that a turnaround can happen in Intel. Well, we're seeing all of the green shoots, if we could call it. We have the core product shipping now. All of the data center products with Sapphire, good momentum on Emerald Rapids later this year, Granite Rapids is here, Forest next year. All of those are looking good. We've seen multiple quarters. And last year, we gained three to four points a share in the client space. Good execution on the client products. And maybe most importantly, the five nodes in four years, getting the process technology back to leadership. And Intel 7, Intel 4, it will be ramping with Meteor Lake, Intel 3 on track, 20A and 18A. We're presenting that now to the market so they can start designing as a foundry customer on those process technologies. And we had another external validation this quarter with a leading edge Intel 3 foundry customer commitment. So all of the things that we said that we needed to do to rebuild long-term leadership, we're on track to do that. And additionally, we laid out this internal foundry model to really attack the operation and efficiency and cost basis of the company. And that's now well underway. So tough economic cycle, but the strategy for a turnaround, nothing has changed in the formula that we have laid out and we're on track to accomplish exactly that. Before we unpack just what's happening in each line of business, and I got this question this morning from an analyst. And Pat, I didn't have the answer. Do you feel as though the guidance that you gave last night, is that kitchen sink, that we're not having this chat again a couple of months from now? Well, one of the things in the guidance that we gave is clearly that our customers are making significant inventory adjustments. And if you think about the way in particular the PC market works, Sazi, Q3 and Q4 are generally buoyed by holiday refresh and back to school purchase cycles. So customers coming off of literally five or six years of shortages, carried more inventory into the second half of the year. They burned inventory in Q3, they burned inventory in Q4, but still had high inventory levels as they finished the year. Q1, those numbers have come down dramatically. In fact, it's the largest inventory turn, burn in recorded history for us. We can't see any period where they're making such dramatic adjustments. We're of course working with customers to make those adjustments, but they're in the second half of the year. So we do believe that the amount that we're selling in is dramatically below what they're selling out as they burn through inventory. So we do believe that they're making the necessary adjustments to have much leaner positions in our customers, inventories and in the channel. So we do believe that, hey, first half, yeah, it's going to be pretty rugged as we go through this period of time, but everybody is predicting some level of market recovery in the second half of the year. So that's reflected in the Q1 guide very firmly. We're also saying, well, we're not quite sure. It's still murky picture for the year in that regard. And we're being somewhat cautious as we lay out what the future looks like, but one that we're also very confident in the long-term position that we're rebuilding for this great company. What ultimately ends this PC correction, Pat? Is it prices coming down or employees or people going back to offices and we need to all upgrade these computers? Well, there's a lot of things going on in the market. One of those is exactly what you say. People going back to offices, they upgrade. We've seen lifetimes continue to increase. But fundamentally, post-COVID, the PC is a more critical device. And with that, this inventory correction, we're still in the 270 to 275 million unit range as our expectations for this coming year. We set a range of 270 to 295, we believe, at the lower end. But the sell-in rate is dramatically below that today. And that's why you say at some point, they just got to start replenishing to the sell-through rate. The other big factor, of course, is China. Obviously, we all know the things that they've been going through. So we expect some unique recovery in the China market as that economy starts coming back, we believe. And we heard very positive statements to that effect at the World Economic Forum this year. So overall, we do believe that first half rugged, some level of recovery as we go through the year. I know you're still dealing with execution issues, still trying to get the rhythm back inside the company. But what is the economic component that you just mentioned, Pat? Do you feel from your perch at Intel that the US is in a recession? Well, any CEO should never talk about the R word. That's for economists. We believe that, hey, there isn't really good news on the horizon here. US, we're still fighting inflation. Europe, still fighting energy, and Ukraine, and China, and Asia still working through the COVID implications. So I say, over the three big markets, we don't see good news yet. That said, I think everybody left, for instance, the World Economic Forum a little bit more optimistic, Sazi, that we're fighting through these in a positive way, and that the correction may be softer in the economy than some had feared against that. For us, we're saying we have to go manage the business in a murky environment. We're adjusting costs. We're on track or ahead with regard to the $3 billion cost savings that we laid out. So we're executing that well. We're adjusting our customer and inventory levels, as we see in the Q1 guide. But fundamentally, it's about getting back to product, getting back to product, technology, leadership that satisfies our customers and wins us back market share. Is the dividend at its current payout ratio, is that safe? Overall, we have to look carefully at our capital allocation, and we have a lot going on in the capital allocation budget. As we think about the capital offsets, US chips and EU chips, and what we're doing for our skip program, semiconductor co-investment, the very innovative co-investment program that we laid out. Of course, we're committed to the dividend and to a very healthy and competitive dividend, and we're also making long-term strategic investments. So we're putting all of that together and looking very carefully at the capital allocation priorities for the company overall, even as we remain committed to rewarding our shareholders with the dividend. You mentioned last night on the earnings call last night that you were looking at other value-creating initiatives inside of Intel. Do you see other assets to be sold? What do you mean by that? Obviously, we're not quite ready to answer that question directly, Sazi, but I point to what we did with Mobileye. Hey, this was one of the few successful IPOs that were done last year. Clearly value-creating in the marketplace is showing that we're being creative in how we can move forward with the assets that we have. The skip program that we described, the capital co-investment program for asset classes and semiconductors. So overall, we're finding very creative ways to lead in how we manage the balance sheet and how we're able to take the assets that we have and present more value to the marketplace. And the comment was really saying, hey, we're working on some more of those ideas. Stay tuned. We're coming back to you in the future. All right. Well, Pat, you're a good guy for coming on here. I know it's probably been a long few hours, but we appreciate you answering these questions. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger will talk to you soon. Have a good weekend. Thank you, Sazi.","Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger discusses company challenges and efforts to achieve long-term leadership in the industry, despite projecting losses not seen in 30 years. He also addresses concerns about the company's dividend and potential value-creating initiatives."
50,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQlDoJMOeYg,TQlDoJMOeYg," Welcome back to What Just Happened on Yahoo Finance. And to understand the industry-wide job cuts that we're seeing in tech, we have to go back to tech stocks monster rally before the Federal Reserve started raising interest rates in this cycle. The Nasdaq 100, it surged by nearly 1500%. If you look back to its prior bear market load, that was all the way back in 2008 and its most recent high, which happened around November 2021. And that period, not coincidentally, was characterized by what you see on the bottom here, which is ultra-low interest rates. We did have a brief period of increases in 2017 and 2018 before rates were cut again. The large cap tech pretty much kept climbing over that period of time. And that's because growth stocks, especially tech, flourish when rates are low. There are two main reasons, a low cost of capital and high incentives for equity investors. So let's talk about that first point. Growth companies want to, well, they want to grow. The early stage model in particular typically involves spending a lot on things like hiring or software development or building a factory that is investing for future growth. When interest rates are low, it's less expensive for companies to borrow money to fuel those initiatives. More mature companies also tend to borrow in this environment. And here's the reasoning. Even if I have a lot of cash on hand, why should I spend my rainy day fund when I can get a cheap loan instead? Investors meanwhile, we're pouring jet fuel on tech's growth. If rates are low and I'm a retail investor, I'm not getting much return on say my savings account or really any fixed income investment like bonds. And maybe I'm doing the same as big companies are doing and borrowing money to invest. If I get a loan and pay 3% interest on that, since I'm pretty confident I can make a higher return elsewhere or a much higher return elsewhere in the stock market, for example, all of this reasoning and all of this came to a halt last year as inflation proved to be quite intransitory. The federal reserve started raising rates and then it kept going. And that has triggered what's called tightening in financial conditions. Among other things, borrowing costs for companies have gone higher and institutional and individual money is no longer flooding into the stock market. That's all resulted in the womp womp for tech stocks in the past year. Despite a rally so far in 2023, the Nasdaq 100 is still down about 28% from that high that we were at back in November 2021. And of course, some individual tech giants were hit even harder last year. If you look at the likes of Meta, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon, Meta in particular, I think was down something like 68% last year. And there's the idea that investors are paying a premium for growth stocks future earnings. Their reputation rests on the promise of future earnings. This has caused investors to question just how much those future cash flows at tech companies really are going to be worth in say five years and whether the earnings are worth waiting for. As we know, where there are doubts, there is investor pullback. Cut off from the supply of easy money wound up cutting costs somewhere and that somewhere has ended up in part being what we have seen in payroll Rochelle. So then Julie with that in mind, then if investors are pulling out of tech, where is the money now headed instead? Well, some of the money has gone back into tech as we've seen so far in 2023. But traditionally, when people are looking for a potential slowdown or a recession on the horizon, they go to a few places, right? They go into fixed income. And we have been hearing that from investor after investor fixed income, one of the most popular trades this year. That's in part because yields are going up, right? If I'm buying government debt, then I'm getting more for my money. If I'm buying investment grade bonds, I'm getting more yield on my money than I was. So called value stocks, right? Those that have been beaten up but are still seeing as a value financials usually fall into that category. Sometimes consumer staples like Procter and Gamble fall into that category. And then there's some overlap between value stocks and defensives, right? Companies that are seen as being able to expand their profits even in an economic downturn. You've got energy stocks, although there's some crossover with value, as I said, like the likes of ExxonMobil and then actual defense companies sometimes as well, like a Lockheed Martin. Well, Julie, when can we expect to see a bounce back or a recovery? I know we're starting to see a little something with Metta at this point. Yeah, with a lot of these tech stocks, we've seen a little bit of a pullback. But a lot of the investors that we've spoken to say tech stocks can't really recover in a meaningful, sustained way until interest rates stop going up or even start to go down from the Federal Reserve. Now, that said, we've had this divergence, right, between the Federal Reserve and where rates have been going. The Federal Reserve isn't done raising rates. It's expected to raise them by another 25 basis points next week. But the 10-year Treasury yield, which tracks rates and perceptions about them, has actually gone down so far this year. That's one of the things that probably has helped the Nasdaq 100. We don't know if that is going to remain intact, Rochelle. Indeed. We don't know when the Fed is going to take their foot off the gas or pause at this point. Either great stuff there, Julie Hyman.","Federal Reserve's interest rate hike led to significant job cuts in the tech industry. Investors turned to fixed income and value stocks while waiting for interest rates to stabilize for a potential recovery of tech stocks. The NASDAQ 100 experienced a surge of nearly 1500 percent from its 2008 Big Bear Market low to its high around November 2021, driven by ultra-low interest rates. During this period, growth stocks, especially in the tech sector, thrived due to the combination of a low cost of capital and strong incentives for equity investors. However, the momentum changed as the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates, resulting in tighter financial conditions and higher borrowing costs for companies. As a result, tech stocks, including giants like Meta (formerly Facebook), Microsoft, Alphabet (Google), and Amazon, faced declines, with the NASDAQ 100 still down about 28 percent from its 2021 high. Investors started seeking alternatives such as fixed income, value stocks, and defensive stocks as they awaited a meaningful recovery in tech stocks, which is predicted to occur when interest rates stabilize or decrease. The 10-year treasury yield, which tracks rates, has gone down in the current year, potentially contributing to support for the NASDAQ 100, but uncertainties remain regarding the future trajectory of rates."
51,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNS4copPiU,3uNS4copPiU," But first, let's roll back and recap what's happened thus far. Dan, give us the lowdown. That's right, Rochelle. The tech industry is reeling from a seemingly nonstop parade of layoffs across Silicon Valley and beyond. And we're not talking small numbers either. Amazon cut 18,000 jobs, Alphabet laid off 12,000 workers, and Meta let go of 11,000 employees. Microsoft, meanwhile, slashed 10,000 positions. And those are just the major announcements. So it's important to put those layoffs in perspective. Compared to the massive number of employees they hired during the pandemic, big tech companies have cut a relatively small number of jobs. So why are we seeing these layoffs? Well, the macroeconomic situation isn't helping, but each company has problems of their own. Google is dealing with slowing ad sales. Ditto Meta, though that company is also pouring billions into its risky metaverse bet. Microsoft has contended with slowing PC and cloud sales. And Amazon just can't get enough people to buy things from its stores. I mean, it's interesting because when you break it down, we hear tech layoffs. But as you see, there's a lot of nuances there within some of these companies. And given how much they did over-hide during the pandemic, you have to wonder how much more we might see in terms of cuts ahead. And notably Apple not also on that list as well, Dan. Yeah, they're seemingly the only one that doesn't have to do any layoffs. There's been talk about how they were very, very easy on hiring during the pandemic. So they didn't go out and say, look, this is all going to change the world entirely. We have to staff up super quick. That's basically what Amazon did. They nearly doubled their workforce. But they went slower. They figured, look, we sell devices. We know that there's demand for devices. We're going to continue to provide those devices. But we don't need the headcount to do that. They already put out more than enough handsets. In fact, for Apple, it was almost a different problem because they were dealing with a chip shortage. So because they are a hardware sales company, they had to contend with that side of the pandemic, not necessarily the staffing up issue. So that seems to be why they were able to kind of move through this time of layoffs relatively unscathed. Yes, there are some hiring slowdowns, but we haven't heard anything about layoffs. Indeed. We'll be keeping an eye, although they do have hiring freezes. But as you mentioned, they're not layoffs at the moment.","Tech companies including Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta have recently announced layoffs due to issues like slow sales, chip shortages, and metaverse investments. Apple has not announced any layoffs.The tech industry has experienced significant layoffs across major companies. Amazon cut 18,000 jobs, Alphabet laid off 12,000 workers, Meta released 11,000 employees, and Microsoft slashed 10,000 positions. Despite these numbers, these layoffs are relatively small compared to the high levels of hiring during the pandemic. The layoffs are attributed to macroeconomic challenges and specific issues within each company, such as slowing ad sales for Google, risky metaverse investments for Meta, declining PC and Cloud sales for Microsoft, and staffing challenges for Amazon. Notably, Apple stands out as the only major tech company without layoffs due to its cautious hiring approach during the pandemic and its focus on hardware sales rather than staffing concerns."
52,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPoELbJiCqA,HPoELbJiCqA," Welcome back to YOW Finance. Get over to Jared Blickery at the Wi-Fi Interactive. Jared. Looking at a little bit of down action, but not much to begin the day, but it's been a positive week overall. Let's check out what the Dow has done. Now, 1.66%, I think the bulls will take that. And check out the NASDAQ. NASDAQ really fulfilling or continuing its role as a leader this year, which is contrasting to last year. NASDAQ is up over 3% over the last few days. Let's just take a longer term look at the market here. Here's the S&P 500 over the last nine months. You can see we are right up against this late November, December peak that we had there. Going to have to climb over that. Already over the 200 day moving average. So we keep having these incremental technical levels, but 4100 is really the level for me. NASDAQ also in a similar situation trying to overcome its highs from late last year. The Russell 2000 though, let me just change this to a candlestick view. You can see just barely breaking out. On top of that we got socks, we got the chip stocks ready to break out here. We also have transportation. Let's take a look at the sectors. We have communication services. That is in the lead. That's up half a percent. Industrials also looking at consumer discretionary. That's in the lead. And financials. Those have been some three winners this year. Tech taking a little bit of a backseat. I think that's on the back of those Intel earnings. Let's take a look at that board. As you can see, Intel down 10 percent, KLA down 7 percent. Lot of red here, but not deep red for the most part. Software kind of a mix board, more red than green. IBM up one third of a percent there. And let's take a look at what's happened with our sector for the week. And you can see it's all about the mega caps. Consumer discretionary, the worst sector last year along with communication services and then tech and then financials and then energy. Interesting mix of not only the value but also some cyclical sectors there. And growth sectors. So a pretty good mix going forward. Let's check out the leaders. ARK and this is over the last five days. ARK is in the lead. That's up five percent. I talked about defense. ITA, that is a defense ETF. That's up four percent. Even with those Intel earnings in that red screen we saw with the chip stocks, those are up four. So all in all, pretty risk on week here. And we'll have to see if this can continue throughout the day until the close and of course next week as well.","Markets had a positive week overall, with the NASDAQ leading. S&P and Russell 2000 are approaching their late 2020 peaks, with several sectors leading. ARK and ITA were among the leading ETFs this week.The Dow has increased by 1.66 percent recently. The NASDAQ has shown strong growth, up over three percent in the last few days. The S&P 500 is close to its late November December peak, with an incremental climb over the 200-day moving average. The Russell 2000 has barely broken out. Intel is down 10 percent, KLA down seven percent, and there's mixed performance in the software sector. Consumer discretionary and Industrials are leading sectors. Mega caps, like Arc, have performed well, with Arc up five percent over the last five days. Overall, it has been a risk-on week in the market."
53,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qc_OeLaC0hg,Qc_OeLaC0hg," All right, Shana, let's check out what's moving after hours. We've got a lot to take a look at here. Dave, we have Intel, KLA, Visa, Hasbro, and Salesforce kicking off with Intel. That's stock off just about 8% here after hours. A weak report here from the company missing on both the top and bottom lines. Their guidance coming in a bit light. We certainly are seeing that reflected in the after hours move here. The CFO of Intel saying that they did take steps to right size the business in Q4. We know their cost cutting efforts. They're looking to cut three billion in cost this year up to 10 billion in 2025. Over the last three months, the stock has gotten a bit of a boost here, up just about 10.5%, nearly giving all of that back though in extended trading. Take a look at KLA. That stock also under a bit of pressure off just about 5% right now. The company's sinking as they outlook disappointed. This, of course, follows that drop in the chip demand. So Intel, KLA, those reports disappointing. We're seeing that also reflected in some of those competitors out there. Nvidia stock under pressure, Qualcomm stock under pressure here after hours. So a couple of names to keep in mind ahead of tomorrow's opening bell. Taking a look at Hasbro, that stock off just about 9% of a huge headlines here. They announced their preliminary results cutting a thousand jobs. 15% of their workforce president and COO here, Eric Nyman, will also be leaving the company. The prelim Q4 revenue number missed. EPS coming in a bit light. Holiday sales underperforms. Certainly we're seeing that reflected in that 9% drop. Taking a look at Visa, that stock up just about 1.5% here. The company beating on both the top and bottom lines. Payment volume up 7%. Visa also saying that effective February 1st, Brian McInerney will be taking over as CEO. Again, we're looking at gains here after hours. Rounding it out with Salesforce. That's under a bit of pressure after popping here in intraday trading, but off just about half of a percent. A Wall Street Journal report now out saying that Elliott is preparing to nominate directors at Salesforce. They didn't name any specific names, but clearly a battle is heating up for some of those board seats. Now the Journal reports followed the Bloomberg report that we got out earlier this afternoon, saying that Salesforce is discussing appointing a new board member. Some of those names that were being discussed, former Carnival CEO Arnold Donald, MasterCard CFO Sachin Amera. Now this is for Salesforce. Wall Street Journal now reporting that Elliott is preparing to nominate its own directors here for Salesforce. Again, the stock up barely in positive territory over the last three months, up just about 3%.","Intel, KLA, and Hasbro's stocks dropped in after-hours trading due to disappointing results, while Visa exceeded expectations. Salesforce faced potential board challenges from activist investor Elliott.Intel's stock dropped approximately 8% due to a weak earnings report, missing expectations on both top and bottom lines, and cautious guidance. The company has undertaken cost-cutting measures to right-size the business.KLA Corp.'s stock fell around 5% after a disappointing outlook, attributed to decreased chip demand, affecting competitors like Nvidia and Qualcomm as well. Hasbro's stock declined by about 9% after announcing preliminary results, including job cuts, a change in leadership, and underperforming holiday sales. Visa's stock increased by approximately 1.5% following better-than-expected earnings, with a 7% rise in payment volume and the announcement of a new CEO. Salesforce's stock experienced slight downward pressure, dropping about 0.5%, amid reports of potential board seat battles and discussions about appointing new board members, including former Carnival CEO Arnold Donald and MasterCard CFO Sachin amera."
54,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyDg9N4tNlA,PyDg9N4tNlA," Taking off with Tesla, Tesla closing up just about 11%. One of the, or the leader in the Nasdaq 100 today, closing at its highest level that we've seen in the last six months. That's the fourth quarter results came in better than fear. Now Wall Street reacting positively to the numbers and the comments about strong demand from CEO Elon Musk. We had Citigroup, Bank of America, Wolf Research, Wells Fargo, Cowan, Webush, among the names there raising their price targets today. And Dave, taking a look at the momentum that we're clearly seeing in Tesla stock, we talked to Gary Black earlier in the show. He's a future fund managing partner there, clearly a Tesla bull. He was saying that the Cybertruck is going to be one of the huge catalysts, get people back on the hype train when it comes to Tesla and really take it back to those higher levels that we had seen. When you take out some of the losses that we've seen over the last 12 months, I'm not sold yet, but clearly the street very encouraged by what we did get from Tesla and by the commentary that we heard from Musk. Are you on team Briggs with the Cybertruck? Because look, I just don't see it. I understand. And you love pickup trucks. You love trucks. I love trucks and I love Teslas, but that car will not be driven by most Americans. It frankly will not. And people always use the preorders as the real catalyst. Those preorders are fully refundable. $100 fully refundable deposit. I'm not buying it. But he also pointed out there, not just the car company, Gary Black and pointing out that megapacks, for example, could be a real catalyst for tremendous earnings down the road. But he said something really interesting as well about Elon Musk's macro talk about the economy. He said investors really don't pay attention to it. But the problem is Elon Musk on that call really undermined his own argument on that call by saying we're going to go through a pretty difficult recession and then saying he sees skyrocketing demand for very expensive EV. That is the Tesla and the potential for two million. So how do you even if he's wrong, how does he justify in that brilliant mind that there's going to be a recession while there's going to be tremendous demand for Teslas? I don't see it. Yeah, something's not adding up there. But I think maybe the positive spin on this, at least from the street's perspective, Deutsche Bank did weigh in on this. If in fact we do see a slowdown, they were saying obviously not great for Tesla, but the company is better positioned given its cash position, given the levers that it does have at its disposal than some of the competitors out there. But you got a question. If we do head for a recession, maybe a larger downturn than what we are anticipating at this point, it's not going to be good for Tesla. It's not going to be good for many consumer facing companies. I would have just liked to hear his justification for why he sees that coming. Just one other note, his CFO I thought was interesting in saying we're going to quote attack every area of cost. That does play into the potential for a recession and maybe that's helpful in cutting the cost of the supply chain. So that was interesting. All right, more earnings news. Reaction in the market today with several airlines moving following quarterly reports. American JetBlue and of course the one we've all been waiting for Southwest reporting today. But you can see Southwest, the loser of the bunch today, the company revealing a $800 million loss due to that holiday travel meltdown in December. Their CEO Bob Jordan telling Bloomberg, quote, we know for a fact we were absolutely staffed to operate our schedules. I do not believe the issue with staffing. Now these comments coming on the same day Southwest as it plans to hire 7000 workers in 2023. So still a bit of a mixed picture from the airline after it canceled 16000 plus flights in late December. And that isn't just a drag on this quarter, but probably Q1 2023. And Shawna, quite frankly, maybe well after. Remember their pilot captain of the union, Casey Murray told us, I asked him, if you were a customer right now, would you fly Southwest? And he said point blank, no, no way. And lay down the reasons for it. Yeah, I think we're certainly are seeing some of that overhang from all the flights. Over 16000 flights canceled. Clearly they are seeing cancellation. Something that CEO Bob Jordan talked about on the earnings call. What surprised me was the fact that he only sees this as being a Q1 issue. I do tend to agree with you, Dave, that I have a hard time buying that maybe some people are going to be a little hesitant when booking with Southwest into Q2, maybe even Q3. But when you take a look at these numbers, clearly it's going to be a challenging several months here for the airline. The company did say that they do expect a negative revenue impact of 300 million to 350 million in the current quarter. Whether or not that, of course, drags on to the second quarter, only time will tell. CEO Bob Jordan also going on to say that they are working with a consultant firm to try to determine some of those issues. To address those issues, it's going to take a huge investment. Like we've talked about time and time again, it's a fix that's not going to happen overnight. It's going to take some time. So Southwest currently has their work cut out for them. I was just curious why you thought JetBlue was down slightly on a really good report. Is that because the good news is already baked in? They've already had a pretty solid month? Yeah, they've had a pretty solid month. When you take a look at some of those larger charts, you have seen longer term charts, I should say. I've seen a bit of a rebound more recently. The stock barely closing negative there. But like you were saying, it was a very different quarter than what we just heard from Southwest. They said that they were on track to deliver those cost reductions that they have been targeting of 250 million dollars through 2024. The CEO saying that the demand environment remains solid this year. So clearly, totally different picture over at JetBlue. Let's take a look at MasterCard because shares of the credit card company closing lower here. You can see off just over one percent after the company warned that revenue growth could slow faster than expected in the current quarter. Still though, MasterCard's CEO saying in a statement that quote, while macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty persists, consumer spending has been remarkably resilient. He then went on to say we are well prepared to adjust our investment profile quickly if needed. So it's interesting just to weigh that against the reaction that we're seeing in the stock Taking a look at the analyst reaction here, they actually said that trends in January look quote unquote healthy so far. So a drop of one percent, not too much to be worried about. No, and it's so interesting again and again and again we hear these predictions of recession and more from the earnings call from their CEO pointed out strong labor market, low unemployment, rising wages, elevated consumer savings levels. And it's a lot like we heard from Paul Riley, Raymond James CEO, really in the show saying I just don't see it. We don't see it in our clients, we don't see it in our customers, but we're going to prepare for it. So it's a strange dichotomy going on with this economy where everyone's coming out and saying we don't see a recession in our customers and our clients, but we're going to potentially prepare for it. Hopefully we don't see it.","Tesla's stock soared on strong Q4 results and positive demand outlook from CEO Elon Musk. However, Southwest reported a loss of $800 million due to holiday travel disruptions, and MasterCard expects slowing revenue growth in the current quarter.Tesla's stock closed up about 11%, reaching its highest level in the last six months after fourth-quarter results beat expectations. Tesla's CEO, Elon Musk, received positive reactions from Citigroup, Bank of America, Wolf Research, Wells Fargo, Colin Webb Bush, and others, who raised their price targets for the stock. The potential catalyst for Tesla's growth is seen in the Cybertruck, despite differing opinions on its mass appeal and the significance of pre-orders. Tesla's CFO discussed plans to cut costs across the supply chain in anticipation of potential economic challenges. Southwest Airlines reported an $800 million loss due to a holiday travel meltdown in December, affecting its Q1 2023 performance and potentially beyond. Southwest plans to hire 7,000 workers in 2023 despite its recent operational challenges.

Hello, sir. Hello. Let's start out with the energy sector. By the way, energy sector, the leading sector today up 3% followed by all the mega cap sectors, XLY, XLC, XLK. We'll get to some of those in a minute. Let's check this out because tomorrow morning we're getting Chevron earnings. Today we are getting an announcement that they are increasing their buyback to $75 billion. This is on top of their existing authorization. They're also hiking their dividend. No expiration date on the buybacks, but RBC expects the oil major to ratchet up the monthly pace. JP Morgan also believing that this could signal better guidance in Chevron's announcement tomorrow morning. We're going to bring you to that live. And let's just take a look at what's happened in the energy sector this year. We know it was by far the best sector last year, but we can see Schlumberger up 7%, Exxon up 6%. We're going to be getting into a lot of those energy earnings in the coming days. Also want to check out something called Sherwin Williams here. And if I can find my Home Builders screen, we're going to see that that is down substantially. Sherwin down about 8.5%. And well, I'll tell you what, the only thing worse than watching paint dry is watching your portfolio shrink because guess what? Having its worst day in two quarters, and that's after delivering a full year forecast that disappointed. Now, we know the housing sector has been battered and bruised, and Sherwin as a proxy is now issuing a warning. Here's the CEO saying, we will not be immune from what we expect to see to be a very challenging demand environment in 2023. Visibility, that's beyond our first half of the year. That's going to be live in it. So caveat painter here, and let's get back to some of the meme stocks that we've been talking about most recently, Bed Bath and Beyond. Let's get to the intraday. We got that right there. Bed Bath and Beyond has so shrunk that it's hard to find on this screen here. Let me just sort by equal weight here, and we can see at the very bottom, there we go. There have been several price halts today due to volatility, and that's based on the gave in their 10Q or 8K today saying that they may have to file for reorganization. That means Chapter 11. So it looks like we got about a minute left here. Let's just cycle through some of the happenings today. We checked out the sector action before. Let's check out our market leaders. Now, K-Web, that is a Chinese ETF. That is in the forefront. That's up almost 3%, but then we have IGV. That is a software tech ETF. FDN is internet ETF. So those leading is actually pretty strong, ahead of ARK even stronger. We're also seeing some strength in the chip stocks. All of these on the top line are outperforming cannabis stocks, and this liquidity, this US bond ETF, those are the only ones in the red. Now, as promised, here's the NASDAQ 100 where we see the mega caps cooperating. We see Microsoft up 3% after its earnings the other day, Tesla up 10%. We're going to be bringing you Intel after the bell, so stay tuned for that in just a few minutes. Other than that, Meta, even Meta is up 4%. Didn't see really any news about that today, but it's nice to see all this green.","Chevron's announcement of increased buyback and dividend pushed energy sector to lead the market. Sherwin Williams faced its worst day in two quarters, and Bed Bath and Beyond experienced volatility after announcing the possibility of filing for reorganization. NASDAQ 100 was boosted by Mega caps, including Microsoft and Tesla. Chip stocks and tech ETFs outperformed.The energy sector led today's market gains, with a 3% increase. Chevron announced an increase in its buyback to $75 billion and a dividend hike. Energy stocks like Schlumberger and Exxon rose 7% and 6% respectively this year. However, Sherwin-Williams faced an 8.5% decline due to a challenging demand environment in the housing sector. Bed Bath and Beyond experienced price halts and potential reorganization. Chinese ETF KWEB rose nearly 3%, software Tech ETF IGV and internet ETF FDN performed strongly, outperforming cannabis stocks and U.S Bond ETF. NASDAQ 100 showed Microsoft up 3%, Tesla up 10%, and Intel's earnings were awaited. Meta also saw a 4% increase without specific news."
56,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieCU9OgSXCg,ieCU9OgSXCg," From Intel, and you can see probably not a good report, down 5.5% after hours on their latest earnings. Let's bring in Jared Blickrey, who has the earnings numbers for us. Presumably, not good ones. No, it was a miss on both the top and bottom lines, and the guidance even worse. Let's talk about the fourth quarter right now. That's a $14.04 billion for adjusted revenue when the estimate was for hire at $14.5 billion. Now that breaks down into client computing, network, and mobile eye revenue, also Intel Foundry services, but mainly client computing revenue. That was a big miss. $6.63 billion. Estimate was for $7.42 billion. Network and edge revenue, $2.06 billion. The estimate was for $2.21 billion. And then mobile eye, that's spinning off, but that came in at $565, besting the streets estimate of $435 million. Now adjusted EPS, I said, was also a miss. That was $0.10 versus the estimate of $0.19. Operating margin disappointing, 4.3% versus the estimate of 7.22%. And then finally for the fourth quarter numbers, I'm going to round this out with adjusted gross margin, 43.8%, a miss below the estimate of 45%. Now here's where we get into that forecast. They're seeing first quarter adjusted gross margin, 39%. The estimate was 45.5%. Intel sees first quarter adjusted loss per share of $0.15. Guess what? The estimate was for a profit of $0.25. So that going in the wrong direction. Also seeing adjusted revenue, $10.5 billion to $11.5 billion when the estimate was for 13, almost $14 billion. So they're looking to make $8 to $10 billion in cost reductions by the end of 2025. And you know Pat Gelsinger's turnaround strategy, probably under a bit of scrutiny here, there are going to be some tough answers for him to field on the call. Should he be there? Which I would expect him to. As you can see, some of the other chip makers down in sympathy. NVIDIA down 1%, AMD down 2%. And let me just get to a quick chart of Intel here over the last few years so we can see what's happened over the pandemic. Basically from the upper left to the lower right here, and that is not the best way for a chart to be situated down 56% over that time period. Guys.","Intel reported disappointing earnings and weak guidance for the first quarter, along with plans to cut costs of $8 to $10 billion by 2025.The Q4 earnings report for Intel showed a 5.5% decline in stock after hours due to a miss on both the top and bottom lines. Adjusted revenue for the fourth quarter was $14.04 billion, falling short of the estimated $14.5 billion. Client Computing Revenue was $6.63 billion, missing the estimated $7.42 billion, while Network and Edge Revenue was $2.06 billion, below the estimated $2.21 billion. Mobileye Revenue exceeded expectations at $565 million compared to an estimated $435 million. Adjusted EPS was 10 cents, well below the estimated 19 cents, and the operating margin was 4.3%, falling short of the estimated 22.2%. Adjusted gross margin was 43.8%, lower than the estimated 45%. Intel's first-quarter forecast included an adjusted gross margin of 39%, significantly lower than the estimated 45.5%, and an adjusted loss per share of 15 cents, contrasting with the estimated profit of 25 cents. The projected adjusted revenue for the first quarter ranged from $10.5 billion to $11.5 billion, compared to the estimated $13.9 billion. Intel aimed for cost reductions of $8 to $10 billion by the end of 2025.

The names being discussed include former Carnival CEO Arnold Donald also MasterCard CFO Sachin Mera. Now the report also states that there are discussions about adding Value Act Capital Management CEO Mason Morfit to the board as well. Salesforce has become a target for activist investors most recently this week Elliott Management which took a multi-billion dollar stake in the company. Indeed like you and I have been talking about this week when Elliott Management enters the picture people listen. Yeah Patrick Gadsden who's an activist investor attorney joined us just a couple of days ago said they are basically the Godzilla of the space. They get what they want, they take as much time as they want and they spend as much money as they want to get their results. But he also said that news that Elliott Management was involved here probably was because either talks had broken down or there was some sort of agreement to satisfy Paul Singer slash Elliott Management and it looks like Shonda that he was probably fortuitous in that that they had some sort of board agreement in place and Elliott wanted to get credit for that. That's just me reading into that they wanted credit for that therefore leaking the story. Yeah certainly we will wait to see if we hear anything from Salesforce either confirming or denying those reports.","Salesforce shares rose 4% on news of new board members including Arnold Donald, Sachin Mera, and Mason Morfit.

58,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_L9-Kx5xSw,C_L9-Kx5xSw," Let's catch up to speed on housing now. Mortgage rates falling for a third straight week rates down slightly to 6.13% on the 30 year fixed and new data reveals home buyer affordability is improving. Mortgage application payments falling 3% in December according to the mortgage bankers association. So good news, yes, mortgage rates continue to fall. I don't predict that the worst is behind us in terms of the housing market. I think that is fantastic. I do think mortgage rates are beginning to flatten out though because the reductions are shrinking. I thought we might land in the mid fives. I don't think so anymore. I think we're still going to be north of six and what do you think? Is that enough to unthaw, to thaw out this market? You're starting to see some of that activity come back but like you're saying it's still above 6%. I don't know if that's going to be enough to get the majority of the buyers that have been on the sidelines for the last couple of months to get them off the sidelines. And remember the Fed is still raising rates. We've got another Fed meeting next week and next week investors are expecting another 25 basis point hike. So as long as that continues or they keep rates at those elevated levels, you got to question whether or not we really will see significant improvement in housing. And we should remind you rates don't necessarily rise and fall with Fed moves but they do tend to similarly shadow that later on. One of the bottom line is here most people are locked into a mortgage somewhere between two and a half maybe low three so you're still looking at twice your mortgage rate to get you off of the sideline. Probably not enough.","Mortgage rates dropped for the third consecutive week, leading to a 3% reduction in mortgage application payments in December, improving home buyer affordability. However, a full market recovery may not occur as long as interest rates remain above 6% and the Fed continues to raise rates.The mortgage rates have fallen for a third consecutive week, reaching 6.13 percent on the 30-year fixed rate. Home buyer affordability has improved, with mortgage application payments decreasing by three percent in December, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Despite the positive trend, some experts believe that the housing market's worst phase might be behind us, although mortgage rates are predicted to remain above six percent. The Federal Reserve is expected to raise rates by another 25 basis points in the upcoming meeting, potentially impacting the housing market's improvement. However, it's important to note that mortgage rates don't necessarily mirror Fed moves but often exhibit similar patterns. Many individuals are locked into mortgages with rates between two and a half to low three percent, which might not be enough to significantly stimulate housing market activity."
59,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM1noYvupCo,MM1noYvupCo," Chipotle announced it's looking to hire 15,000 new workers for its busy season as the restaurant chain continues to expand across the U.S. and Canada. Brooke DePalma is here with the details. Obviously, they're hiring me. Meanwhile, it's interesting you're seeing a lot of tech still going through their layoffs and firings here. That's right. Good morning, Rochelle. Chipotle investing heavily in labor this morning out with that announcement of hiring 15,000 workers ahead of its busy season or what it calls its burrito season from the months of March to May. Chipotle is supporting to confirm here that those new hires will be kept on beyond just the busy season. They're calling this what it calls a hiring campaign called Pull Back the Foil. It features employees who have rose in the ranks from crew members to managers. Now in 2022, 90% of crew members or rather managerial roles were internal promotion. This comes as Chipotle has aggressive growth plans. It plans to open 7,000 locations in North America in 2020. For the 20th year alone, it plans to open 255 to 285 new restaurants. And Brooke, this comes as voters in California are set to decide on a new law that could come with some changes. That's right. It's called the FAST Act. And as of Tuesday, the California State Secretary announced that it's going to be on the 2024 state election ballot as it was supposed to go into effect on January 1st, but a petition gathered enough signatures for it to be put on pause, I guess you could say, and put on that ballot. And so, of course, this would form a 10-person committee that would ultimately be able to weigh in on minimum wage standards, health and safety protocols, time off polities, and more things that have to do with labor and wage for fast food workers. But some opposition here. Of course, CEOs not liking this, but unionization efforts and union groups certainly advocates for this as they're always looking to improve labor and wage conditions here. But C-Sweets talking against it. The latest announcement comes from McDonald's, who spoke out on the FAST Recovery Act, saying that in part an unelected council of political insiders, not local business owners, and their teams will make big decisions about crucial elements of running a business fracturing the economy and the process. And this has been an ongoing concern last year. Chipotle CEO weighing in on this and the impact that it could have on a higher wage. All right, Brooke DePalma, thank you so much.","Chipotle plans to hire 15,000 workers and open 255 to 285 new restaurants in 2022.

60,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZqjUaLyHX4,bZqjUaLyHX4," All right, we're moving to tech now. Job cuts in the industry continue to mount with IBM, Lammer Research and SAP, the latest to announce job cuts. Yahoo! Finances' Dan Howley has the details. Hey, Dan. That's right, Rochelle. We're seeing more and more job cuts from the tech industry. Obviously, it's already been stung by huge, huge pullbacks in jobs from the likes of Amazon, Microsoft, Meta. And now we're seeing them from IBM, though not as large as we saw from either Microsoft, Meta or Amazon, which was in the tens of thousands. This is much lower. We're also seeing them from SAP. And really, the big overarching kind of message is that, yeah, we hired too many people during the pandemic. We thought that this was going to be a new way of life. And so we ended up hiring for that. Obviously, that's not the case. People don't want to just be on computers forever. They want to be able to go outside. Or they just don't necessarily need to be on them so much. So now we're seeing these companies try to kind of course correct after making those enormous hires. That's not to say, though, especially in the case of IBM, that they're not going to be hiring anymore. A number of these companies, there are hiring freezes at some, but a number of them will continue to hire in very specific areas, those being related to things like the cloud or heavy computing areas. So it's not as though there's a complete stoppage when it comes to hiring in these areas. It's just that they're trying to now cut back on what they did hire. And we had a chart a few days ago basically showing the percentage of workforces for different tech companies that were hired during the pandemic versus who were being let go now. And it seems as though they're not letting go as many as they hired. So obviously, we can see here Amazon with that 18,000, Alphabet with 12,000, Meta with 11, Microsoft with 10, and then down and down from there. But it seems as though this is something that is just going to basically royal the tech industry, perhaps for the next few months. And as you're talking about there, a lot of over hiring, but some of these big layoffs, are we at the end of perhaps some of these major layoffs? Do we expect more to continue as we still then see people sort of shifting to different tech companies and sort of rehiring them? I think this is basically what we're going to have from the companies that have announced so far. Obviously, we have Intel announcing their earnings after the bell. There was some rumbling about them potentially having layoffs as a result of the drop in PC demand. That's really suffered. People purchased their computers during the pandemic. They don't need to buy them again for perhaps another five years. So that's really hurting them a good deal. So I think we could hear something from the chip space. That's you know, we haven't really heard much from there. We've heard that there are hiring freezes or there are slowdowns, but nothing as far as layoffs. I think that might be the next place we start to see it. All right. Well, thank you for that update there, Dan Howley there for us.","Tech companies such as IBM, Lammer Research, and SAP have announced job cuts due to over-hiring during the pandemic.

61,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qs1L_Rxt4VQ,qs1L_Rxt4VQ," Meta is ending former President Donald Trump's Facebook suspension, saying in a statement that his Instagram and Facebook accounts will return in the coming weeks. Though just because he's reinstated, it doesn't mean he will return. For more on Meta's decision and its impact to the social media landscape, let's get to Yahoo! Finances' Ali Garfinkel. Now, we know he was also invited back to Twitter. Didn't seem to be interested in that. So where do things stand here then with Meta? Yeah, Rochelle, I'll be completely honest with you here. I'm sort of struggling to take the temperature on this moment because on one hand, it feels almost a little anticlimactic. It's been a few years and he sort of has been invited back, as it were. But on the other hand, it feels high stakes and the takes are flying. And I think it's important to run through those takes just a little bit because from the legal side, what we have is this renewed conversation about the definition of town square. Now, some legal experts are telling me that in terms of Trump's constitutional rights This could be the right call on Meta's part if you believe Meta is running a digital town square. However, to others, since Meta is a private company, this isn't a public town square they're running. It's a private business. So you already have that legal side of it. And going beyond that, it's as thorny as you'd expect. I have advocates telling me that they're worried this will increase Trump's reach through 2024 as the election grows closer. And even one professor I was speaking to was saying that we need to remember that this could give Trump a powerful fundraising tool. However, I think it's important to say Meta was very equivocal in this. They're not giving him free rein here. They've said that they will be monitoring him closely and that there will be what they call guardrails. And I will say those guardrails are very necessary. We have to remember the reason he was banned in the first place. And that was the events of January 6. So then I mean, what happens next here? Because he may or may not decide to hop on these. It's hard to imagine he doesn't get back on these platforms when you think about his presidential aspirations. I think it's really unclear, Rochelle, right? But on one hand, it would make sense. But on the other, he has truth social. And we now know just because he's reinstated, though, doesn't mean he will leave true social. It doesn't mean he'll return to these platforms. For instance, as you said earlier, Elon Musk reinstated him to Twitter a while back and he has opted to stay off the platform so far. So I think where this could get interesting is it could be a huge story over time. We could see things go back. We could see renewed efforts at content moderation. One expert I was speaking to said that this was as scary as this was for him personally. This was also an opportunity to reimagine how content moderation can work for someone with the profile of Donald Trump. In the end, though this could be a major story, there could also be radio silence. I don't know. Trump and silence don't usually go hand in hand, especially with how much it might be at stake in 2024. But strength is strength. We'll keep an eye on that. Indeed. Ali Ghalfiq, thank you so much for that update.","Meta is lifting the suspension of former President Trump's Facebook account, with Instagram and Facebook accounts to return soon, subject to guardrails. It remains uncertain if Trump will continue using these platforms or his own Truth Social."
62,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As5uIBNVchc,As5uIBNVchc," A boon for bonds. Fixed income said to see an additional boost as the Fed is expected to raise interest rates and is unlikely to change its course until inflation data improves. But not all fixed income is made equal. Here with more is Chip Huey, Truist Wealth Managing Director of Fixed Income. Good to see you Huey. So as we've been mentioning there in the intro there, lots of different strategies. You have obviously active, passive, a hybrid for people who are trying to figure out which strategy or how they should use these strategies in this environment. How should they navigate this? Yeah, great. Thanks, Rochelle. It's great to be with you. Thanks for the opportunity. I think that there's really two main ways where we see attractive opportunity in fixed income, two ways to approach it. So on the one hand, we have sort of the passive approach. In the front end of the yield curve, in the first two, three years of the curve, we're seeing some of the highest yields that we've seen in the past 15 years. And that's largely a result of the Fed's interest rate increases. And so buying individual high quality securities there, you're capturing some of the highest yields we've seen in more than a decade. But it also gives the opportunity to allow those bonds to roll to maturity and to make routine reinvestment decisions. At that point, given the economic uncertainty we've seen, that's a pretty valuable amount of optionality, flexibility in making new decisions as we get new data. So then what are some of the ones that you're rolling out or rolling into to really account for some of the changes expected ahead? Yeah, so that speaks sort of to the other way to approach it, more of a portfolio or total return context. Back in late October, we upgraded our views of durations or so longer dated fixed income because we do see risks of recession rising as we progress through this year. And if you go back through history, long duration or longer dated high quality fixed income does tend to outperform as the economy slows down or enters recession. So from a portfolio context, we saw greater value in duration as the 10 year rose above, call it 4%, four and a quarter. And that's still what we see. We recommend a few things. One, keeping fixed income simple for right now, staying high quality in anticipation of opportunities in riskier fixed income down the road over the course of the next six to 12 months. That would probably be a better opportunity for an entry point at that point. Right now, though, when we when we made that upgrade to duration, the 10 year was a fair amount higher, about 425. So we would be a little bit more patient for major duration moves right now. We are right in the middle of the trading range that we identified coming into this year. But if we see it, see yields rise up towards that 4% range again, value comes back again for duration. Now, this can be hard because obviously a lot of people, when we see the markets move with every single Fed announcement, we know that the Fed is going to continue on this road. At least we're expecting that 25 basis point hike, but still don't seem to be at that threshold where they plan on pausing anytime soon. How are you factoring in when then to extend or reduce duration on some of these? Yeah, so we do expect the Fed to raise by 25 basis points next week, possibly one to two more 25 basis point rate hikes beyond that. And then we expect the Fed to move to a pause and to hold rates steady. And I think that one thing that perhaps the market is under appreciating, we think that it's a really high bar for the Fed to start reducing those rates. They have a tremendous amount of scar tissue from the inflation experience that we've just gone through over the course of the past 12 to 18 months. And we're going to need to see inflation data consistently cool and stay on this downward trajectory before the Fed gains comfort and potentially cutting. And right now, the market is pricing in multiple cuts by the end of this year. We're not completely convinced that the Fed won't hold steady and allow inflation to cool and also to relieve some of the tightness that we're seeing in the labor market. I mean, between some of the the extra optimism, as you were saying, in some of these estimates as to whether the Fed will start when the Fed will start cutting this year, you also have, of course, issues over the debt ceiling. Now, obviously, we're expecting this to be resolved. But what should people keep in mind as we have this period of volatility right now? Right. I'll say right out in the outset, because we've been getting a lot of questions about this. It's a really important question. We do think that ultimately Congress comes to an agreement and the U.S. avert default. But if we go back to the most similar proxy to what we're to what we're seeing now, we have to go back to to 2011 when it was another contentious debt ceiling debate. And what we did see is as that deadline approached, investors grew very uneasy. Actually, over the course of about a month, the 10 year fell about 100, 100 basis points or one percent in yields as investors flew into into quality, right into a risk off mentality. And we saw rate volatility really spike around that deadline. So we do think that it is it is likely that we will see volatility increase as we move as we move towards that deadline. The likelihood of some of some kind of brinkmanship tactics and in some 11th hour negotiations could make the market feel pretty uneasy. And so it is that is a deadline to watch. But we do think that the worst outcomes that a lot of attention is on right now are ultimately going to be going to be avoided. Well, certainly good to keep that in mind, because when things start going a bit left towards that, people should keep that keep that steady hand. But ultimately, Congress does always end up resolving this. Chip Huey, their truest wealth managing director, fixed income. Thank you so much.","Fixed income is expected to benefit from the ongoing interest rate hikes by the Fed, and there are two main approaches to investing in fixed income: the passive approach in the short-term yield curve and the portfolio approach in longer-dated fixed income.The Fed is expected to raise rates by 25 basis points with potential additional hikes before a pause, contingent on inflation data. Market volatility is expected due to the debt ceiling debate, drawing parallels to 2011 when yield volatility spiked around a similar deadline"
63,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT7bE-ff_jM,zT7bE-ff_jM," It is a concern, it has been for a long time and I think we've published research many times in the past where we say the thing is one, the enemy is inside of Tesla. Musk is an incredible driving force but he's also the one that brings unnecessary risk in a way to the situation. At the same time, what we have to keep in mind is what we say as well is Tesla is bigger than Musk. So he has been the impetus. The question with Elon Musk as an individual is he does a lot of things, maybe too many things, but it's not like he's going to listen to you if you tell him what to do, he's not going to do it. He has to self-correct. So he is the person who is going to decide, can I do SpaceX, Tesla, Twitter, do I have to dedicate more? Can he though? Do you think he can? Exactly. No. Well, again, you're not going to tell him and I'm not going to tell him because he won't listen. It's up to him. He's going to have to make that decision and what we need to be comfortable with as investors, let's say Tom Tzu has been rumored as being our number two coming in, great news that he's got the values of Tesla so that's an internal point that's very important. But will he be given a free rein to run Tesla if that's what is decided? And that's the part he's going to take time for us to get comfortable with that. Again, no, the self-correcting mechanism at Elon Musk is Elon Musk and nobody else.","Elon Musk is seen as a driving force for Tesla, but there are concerns about his risk-taking behavior.

They had an earnings miss because of that. Still though, a revenue beat. How would you characterize where South West is though, because all that focus really on that loss? This is the most difficult time they've ever had. People have always relied on South West for three things. Low fares, lack of fees and enormous public support. The low fares aren't there anymore. They price reasonably. Other airlines have done away with fees, a lot of fees. And now after what happened over the Christmas, you had millions of people who were really badly badly hurt. So they can't rely now on the fact that everyone loves us. They've got to pick up from bootstraps and try to rebuild their airline as a going concern for the consumer. And South West really does have some of the most loyal fans. I think you compared them to grateful dead groupies, but obviously a bad experience can change a lot of that. And we did see president and CEO Bob Jordan recognizing how much they'd let their customers down. And they talked about these cancellations though, and slower bookings continuing in January and February. They even said in their SEC filing, based on current revenue and cost trends, we currently expect a first quarter 2023 net loss. However, we are encouraged by the current booking trends in March of 2023. Our 2023 plan continues to support solid profits with year over year margin expansion for the full year 2023. Would you be as optimistic? Do you think those ripple effects are going to have perhaps gone away by then? I don't know. I really don't. I mean, I love South West. Bob Jordan, I think is doing as good a job as anybody could. But keep in mind, you had millions of people, millions of families who had their holiday destroyed right now today, even with the refunds. Having run a refund department at American Airlines, you can't do things normally here. When someone says they lost their deposit on the hotel, South West has to make that good. This is not a normal situation. Otherwise, they're not going to have anywhere near the loyal support they've had before December. And we're certainly seeing the stock price punished for that. I mean, he did apologize again in that SEC filing. And he also said that they do plan to investigate what happened and really invest in technology as well. What is it going to take then for South West to really regain the competitive edge, being that now it is perhaps at a more level playing field with some of these bigger airlines? Well, right now, I mean, the warning is there. They've got to fix the one system that caused all this. It's one system at one airline that caused this disaster. It is being addressed. But again, you have people out there that are saying that I didn't see grandma for the last time. I didn't have a good Hanukkah. I did not have a good Christmas. And it's all Southwest fault. And when I asked for a refund, they only gave my ticket back. Southwest has a lot of work to do to get that back again, because they're in a hole right now. And meanwhile, we have American Airlines really touting how well they've fed operationally over the holiday season. Strong demand picture, earnings beat record Q4 in full year as well. How does how does American Airlines compare? Because we also saw JetBlue with record revenue as well. But it does seem to be a tale of margins. Well, one thing to hit look, flexibility is going to be everything in the next three years. Flexibility meaning what you can fly, how you can fly, where you can fly. Southwest Airlines has two different configurations, one thirty seven seats, one seventy five and anything above that and below that they really can't access. So they're going to be somewhat in a corner fleet wise. And that's going to be a challenge as well, because in the next five years, what you can do is look at how many markets you can operate and have multi-mission airplanes. This is something people haven't noticed, but Southwest Airlines may have a deficit there. And what about JetBlue? Because, I mean, they saw Q4 record revenue as well, but they definitely weren't as optimistic about what their first quarter of twenty twenty three was going to look like. They need to be optimistic because guess what? Their purchase of Spirit was not a merger. They bought assets. They're the one airline today with that if that purchase goes through, they're going to have airplanes, new airplanes, and they're going to have pilots. Other airlines are going to look for others because they bought the assets really of Spirit and they're going to be the best postured airline over the next three to four years to grow. And I'm looking forward to seeing how well they grow, because it's going to be huge. How do you see the perhaps market share changing as we look at this industry and we look at some of the changes and investments these major airlines are making? Well, you know, the big issue we have to realize is a new world. I mean, you know, four years ago, you had eight million people back and forth between China and the US. That's down to one hundred thousand or two hundred thousand. Now it's going to stay there. So you have to be able to move very flexibly. And if you move flexibly, that means you have to have a fleet to do that. So I would say you're looking at airlines like American Delta, United. These are all very well managed airlines and same thing with Alaska. So I'm thinking the shares are going to stay the same because airlines now are only going to fly what they want to fly. They're not chasing economics anymore. They're making the economics. And they've clearly shown that the demand is there. We're clearly seeing the ticket prices not going down and people still willing to pay the high prices. A big thank you there to Mike Boyd, president of Boyd Group International. Thank you for joining me this morning.","Southwest Airlines faces a tough period after holiday travel crisis caused $800m hit, while American Airlines and JetBlue see strong demand and earnings. The industry is expected to prioritize flexibility and technology investment to adapt to new challenges. "
65,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52oTqJUWIPk,52oTqJUWIPk," All right, well, Tesla out with a beat on the top and bottom line in its latest quarter, with the stock seeing a pop this morning on the back of its earnings release as the EV maker eased investor fears of weaker growth. However, the view on Tesla among analysts shows not all is smooth sailing. Here with the details is Yahoo! Finance's Pras Subramanian. Obviously, a lot of people were watching this to see what would happen. Yeah, Rochelle, you know, big earnings and big call last night. Reaction mixed, you know, nice pop today in the stock. You have people like Dan Ayers calling it the Super Bowl for Tesla. But you're absolutely right, though, you know, among others, there's been some sort of kind of consternation about what this means. So, you know, Goldman's Mark Delaney reiterated his buy rating here, claiming Musk's comments on January orders being to date the strongest ever was, quote, the most important takeaway from the call. And I tend to agree with that. On the flip side, Tony Sakunagi, Alliance, Bernstein, a noted Tesla bear reiterated his underperforming. They're saying he's torn after the call and the earnings statement. It's concerned about margins and whether demand can be sustained at these levels. Finally, Citi's Itte Mikali, he raises price like it's 146, claiming the call gave him some gave some relief to the bulls. But there are still concerns like margins and a big free cash flow missed last night, which is actually kind of flew under the radar. So kind of a mixed bag here from the analyst point of view. But the stock is there's no there's no discussion. The stock is up 10 percent today. And we knew the margins were going to be a big theme this earnings season, but you mentioned things flying under the radar. What are some of the things that one might have missed from Tesla's earnings? You know, there was a lot on that call from Cybertruck to to FSD and things like that. But I think under the radar, some stuff must be talking about how he started once to maintain strong volume growth while maintaining margins. You know, that's kind of tough in an environment right here where margins are under pressure, prices, inflation is rising. But maybe if prices do come down and you have ramp ups in places like Berlin and Giga Austin, maybe you can have that both that that magic that magic sort of mix of rising margins, but lowering prices. Another nugget that he kind of mentioned that sort of flew in the radar was, you know, talking about who could challenge Tesla down the line must that it could likely be a Chinese competitor because they work harder and work smarter than anyone else. Thought that was interesting, you know, kind of a dissier to American and European automakers who are sort of, you know, kind of coming at Tesla domestically here, but also in Europe, too. Indeed, a bit of a bit of a dig there, I think. I think you're right there. Probably supermanian there for us. Thanks so much.","Tesla beats Q1 earnings expectations, with a 10% stock price increase. However, analysts have mixed reactions, particularly on margins and sustainable demand.Citis Mikali raised price targets to 146, finding relief for the Bulls, but concerns lingered about margins and a significant free cash flow miss. Tesla's earnings call also discussed maintaining strong volume growth while managing margins, potential competition from Chinese automakers, and the challenges posed by rising prices and production ramps in Berlin and Giga factories."
66,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-o4qWhhUmQ,1-o4qWhhUmQ," look, we got to get some some some vibe checks here and I'll just be straight away about this one. I gave this on a scale of 10 to three at the end of the day and here's why because if there is a path towards a fully sustainable future for humanity as Elon Musk was talking about on the call, then I need more excitement that they're pumping through during these communications and I didn't get that. I was sitting here trying to stay awake flights of chicken cutlets from Dave's Hot Chicken just trying to make it through this call, Saz. Well, I'm just sitting here in my uh my ninth energy drink from today in my trusty Yahoo Finance Cup and if you're out there watching it, I know millions of you are, you want one of these cups, just drop me a tweet. I'll get you over one. My vibe check is this, it's bad, bad, bad, bad. I know the stock is reacting positively but I really don't give a damn because here's what I saw in this conference call. Brad, to your point, you have Elon warning about a severe recession. He said this before but I do not want to hear Elon Musk warning about a recession. Check done, do not like it. What I don't also like is that sketchy volume outlook from Tessa calling for 38% growth this year year over year that is below their long-term CAGR or compound annual growth rate as Wall Street likes to say of 50%. Do not like that as well and then no sign on the pickup in demand if there was one on recent price cuts. I don't like any of it. He was asked this repeatedly. I would have liked to see Elon step up and say, we cut prices, people buying more of our junk.","Speaker expresses concerns on Tesla's conference call about a potential recession, slow growth rate, and lack of demand for products despite recent price cuts."
67,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8LVZnreROg,C8LVZnreROg," All right, let's take a look at what is trending after hours. First up, let's take a look at Tesla. Those results pushing the stock up to the upside here after hours up just about 1%. Take a look at some of those numbers here is actually a pretty strong quarter for Tesla. Some of the commentary from Tesla just about where they see deliveries going their long term delivery growth target. They're reaffirming the fact that they will be able to meet that 50% target. That was, of course, a huge headline coming out of that report. Tesla is also remaining on track to start production of its cyber truck later this year. Some other headlines crossing right now that Tesla did enter into a credit pact on January 20th with a city bank that had the pact provides for revolving credit line of up to 5 billion commitments for up to an added $2 billion going forward. Lenders also include Deutsche Bank there. So again, Elon Musk's Tesla, they're slightly beating on revenue estimates here and you're seeing that stock pop after hours Dave. Net income and revenue. Up 59% and 37% respectively from a year prior. Imagine what this company would do without the Twitter overhang without thinking about the personality of the CEO and founder before buying a car. Boy, it'd be a lot like SpaceX. A true rocket ship. Certainly would be right. Let's take a look at IBM. That company also reporting after the value. Look at the stock under pressure off just about 2%. They did beat on the top and bottom lines revenue of 16.69 billion EPS of $3.60. Another big headline coming out of this report. The fact that the company is cutting 3900 jobs. So Dave, just the latest tech company there to announce job cuts. Yeah, Daniel Newman joined us earlier and the big question has been for years this total overhaul turnaround. Of IBM it has been like turning around a giant gas tanker and it's cost them 120 billion estimated dollars. But Daniel Newman told us he thinks that transition is finally complete. You're seeing the upside. All right, let's take a look at service. Now that stock on the move after hours here. You can see it off just about 4.5% was off just about 9% a few minutes ago. Adjusted EPS for the quarter fourth quarter coming in $2.28. So it's for $2.02. The company seeing first quarter subscription revenue of 1.99 billion to 2 billion. The estimate there was for 1.96 billion adjusted revenue 2.03 billion for the company estimate there was for 2 billion. Let's take a look at Levi's another stock here moving after hours. It's up just about 7% EPS beat during the quarter net revenue of 1.59 billion estimate was for 1.57 billion full year net revenue guidance also coming in pretty stronger. Seeing that stock pop after hours again the retail sector which many analysts have been bracing for a severe slowdown there as consumers do pull back their spending that stock though beating the estimates and we're seeing shares up just about 7% real quick. Las Vegas stands out with its results taking a look at shares up just about 3% revenue of 1.12 billion. That was a miss a wider than expected loss adjusted loss of 19 cents. The estimate there was for a loss of 8.5 cents. CEO in this earnings release remaining very optimistic saying he is still confident in the robust recovery of course so that continues to be challenging when you take a look at the Macau business there. Yeah, the China reopening going to be major for companies like LVS.","Tesla's revenue and net income exceeded expectations, causing a rise in their stock after hours. IBM beat top and bottom lines but announced job cuts. ServiceNow missed EPS estimates and saw a decline, while Levi's beat revenue estimates and rose. Las Vegas Sands missed revenue estimates but remained optimistic about recovery.Tesla's stock is up around 1% after hours, with net income and revenue up 59% and 37% respectively from the previous year. IBM's stock is down around 2% after hours, reporting revenue of 16.69 billion and EPS of $3.60. The company is cutting 3,900 jobs. ServiceNow's stock is down around 4.5% after hours, reporting an adjusted EPS of $2.28 for the fourth quarter and first-quarter subscription revenue estimates. Levi's stock is up around 7% after hours, beating EPS estimates and providing strong full-year net revenue guidance. L.V. Sands' stock is up around 3% after hours, with revenue of $1.12 billion, a wider than expected adjusted loss of 19 cents, and the CEO expressing confidence in recovery."
68,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQr3nK25rcc,YQr3nK25rcc," Signs of some recovery in the housing market. Weekly mortgage applications increasing 7% last week according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. This coincides with three straight weeks decline of mortgage rates. Falling rates could mean Americans who held off on buying may move back into this market. 83% of Americans say buying a home is a priority for them according to a Nerd Wallet survey. However, the survey also found only 11% plan on buying in the next 12 months. So clearly we need to see some more signs of recovery. Redfin earlier today, Shana, tweeting out that they are seeing what they believe is the beginning of a turnaround, something the worst is still to come. But one of their agents, in fact, said more buyers this month than all of Q4. So it certainly appears to be in many parts of the country the beginning of some relief. Yeah, certainly. And this is something that the housing market has been waiting for, something the housing market wants to see clearly. Even mortgage rates to fall even further. Despite some of that optimistic tone that we're hearing from Redfin, Needham did cut its housing market forecast for the year today. They lowered their revenue estimate for Redfin, also for some of its peers, Zillow and Compass. Needham saying that they're taking a more conservative approach to Redfin's future and future market gains, especially not even this year, but also next year, looking out to 2024. So I think some questions just in terms of what the housing market, what that demand is going to look like. And we saw that reflected in some of those stocks today. Redfin closing off just over 8% today. So when you take a look at the pressure, clearly that that is placing on the stock recently. We have seen some improvement in the housing market. You talk about that activity, but certainly we do have a ways to go. Yes, surprising that two-thirds of Americans say a housing market crash is imminent in the next three years, which is a really strange disconnect, because not many who cover this sector are predicting that. There was a lot of talk about Armageddon several months ago, but I think most believe that we're going to be okay. Although I do not entirely disagree with the projections from Goldman Sachs in a note earlier this week. They have four markets that they believe are due for a crash, which means 25% decline or more in 2023. They say those cities are San Jose, and look what's happening in the tech environment, all those layoffs. That makes sense. Austin, Texas, where you saw prices just go dramatically through the roof over the last year. Phoenix and San Diego. And I think you could probably add about two or three others to that list, perhaps Tampa Bay, Florida. I think Miami's going to be okay, but both of those markets have about a 30% increase. So there are going to be some select cities that see that 20% fall in housing prices, but the most part, I think low single digits. Yeah, we'll get some more data this week. We have new home sales tomorrow, pending home sales on Friday, so we certainly will keep an eye here on the housing market as we do await more of a recovery there.","Housing market recovers with lower mortgage rates, boosting applications. Few Americans plan to buy a home in the next 12 months. Some experts foresee a market crash in certain areas, while others predict low single-digit growth.Weekly mortgage applications increased by seven percent, coinciding with three weeks of declining mortgage rates. 83 percent of Americans prioritize buying a home, but only 11 percent plan to buy within the next year. Redfin reported increased buyer activity, suggesting a potential turnaround. Needham lowered its housing market forecast, including revenue estimates for Redfin, Zillow, and Compass. Two-thirds of Americans believe a housing market crash is imminent in the next three years, though many experts disagree. Goldman Sachs predicts potential market crashes in cities like San Jose, Austin, Phoenix, and San Diego, with some markets seeing a 20 percent fall in housing prices."
69,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caPJpv5xJZI,caPJpv5xJZI," Well, Ivy, I'm just releasing its Q4 results, and this is where it has that for us, Aness. Yeah, Sean, I'm taking a look at fourth quarter revenue. That came in at $16.69 billion, so that was above expectations. The estimates was for $16.38 billion. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $3.60. That was about in line with expectations. Fourth quarter free cash flow came in at $5.21 billion. And here's some commentary from Arvind Krishna, IBM's chairman and CEO. He said, our solid fourth quarter performance capped a year in which we grew revenue above our mid-single digit model. He went on to say, looking ahead to 2023, we expect full year revenue growth consistent with our mid-single digit model. Now, a headline that has come out is from CFO James Kavanaugh, who gave an interview who said, IBM is going to eliminate about 3,900 jobs. So we have seen in the tech industry, job losses. We've seen companies cutting costs by cutting jobs, and IBM appears to be going ahead with the same route with CFO James Kavanaugh saying that they're going to eliminate about 3,900 jobs. The stock in after hours is slightly higher, guys. Yeah, certainly, I think that we have been hearing on these earnings calls are really from many of its peers within the industry. Ines, thanks so much.","IBM beats Q4 revenue expectations with $16.69 billion but plans to cut 3,900 jobs.IBM reported fourth-quarter revenue of $16.69 billion, surpassing expectations, with adjusted earnings per share of $3.60, in line with estimates. Fourth-quarter free cash flow amounted to $5.21 billion. "
70,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVH885Cut9o,EVH885Cut9o," Here is your closing bell on Wall Street. All right, that wraps up today's trading day. We'll take a look at the numbers across the board. We didn't travel too far from the flat line. The Dow barely eking out, game flipping back into positive territory in the final couple minutes of trading up just about nine points. So the S&P off by a fraction there just below the flat line. The NASDAQ off just about two tenths of a percent. Let's get into some of the day's top movers. We got to start with Shopify was a major winner today. The company announcing price increases to three of its plans and you can see the stock closing up nearly 11 percent. Now merchants will now be charged $39 for the basic plan. That's up from $29. $105 for the Shopify plan, an increase from 79 bucks. The advanced plan has the largest increase moving from $299 up to $399. Indeed this is a welcome move by the street. Some analysts saying that this was long overdue. True is saying that price increases were due now for quite some time. So that increase by about 30 percent, 33 percent across the board for its plans. Clearly it looks like the street is pretty bullish on that given what that could potentially do to its revenue. Long overdue yes, 12 years since they've increased their prices. But also to your point there, these are massive price increases. Essentially a third across the board leaving you with that question of how many people are going to ditch Spotify because of that drastic a price increase in this economy with inflation what it is, with the potential recession around the corner. Obviously I think a lot of people may have to get rid of Shopify but that's not what the analysts think because Baird says we don't think these prices warrant a change for the vast majority of merchants given a couple of things. The time and effort required to shift platforms and probably most importantly that Shopify offers superior e-commerce functionality at a reasonable price. KeyBank analyst also agrees that people will not have to leave Shopify again. In this economy I'd be surprised though you can lock in the annual prices if you sign on an annual deal you can lock in the current prices right now. Yeah for a couple of months. I think it's also key to look at what some of its competitors have done or when you take a look at some of the other names in that space Intuit, Wix.com, they implemented price increases here already so the fact that I guess Shopify now just catching up to them maybe that's why some of these analysts aren't too worried about those churn numbers that you were just talking about. Baird actually saying that this could add $200 million to subscription revenue for 2023 and they actually see that number rising to $300 million to $350 million in incremental revenue on an annualized basis going forward so that I think is why we are seeing such a jump in the stock today. It's been a good start to the year for them as well up 30% but that stock lost almost half its market cap in 2022 so a long way until they recover. Next up is Boeing shares teetering near the flatline slight gain today after the aircraft producers fourth quarter earnings release. The company's $19.98 billion fell short of Wall Street revenue estimates while its adjusted loss per share came in at $1.75 more than a buck more than the street had been expecting. Boeing attributed the lagging losses to supply chain issues while despite rebounding sales and deliveries again they point to really some struggle in the supply chain but labor issues as well Shana. Jet engines other components have certainly been a challenge here for Boeing but when you take a look at the stock reaction initially it caught me by a bit of surprise a lot of that though has to do with the cash flow numbers that we did get from the company they were pretty strong when you take a look at the cash flow beating expectations their CEO Dave Calhoun though once again reiterating the fact that those challenges the same challenges that we have been talking about some of the supply chain issues do remain going forward revenue was about in line with expectations it's also going to be interesting to see what the demand is like from China we talk about the reopening there how quickly that could potentially come back online when we talk about their economy going forward once that gradually starts to reopen the reopening I should say picks up more steam that could be a bullish sign for Boeing going forward. Calhoun said they've got more big orders in line right now than he's ever seen and he said most of them are coming from outside the United States fact sets surveyed 26 analysts 18 have an overweight or a buy seven holds in just one cell gives you a pretty good sampling of how investors feel about Boeing. Certainly does RBC coming out saying not a lot of news in this but not a lot of news in this case was good news for the stock again the stock closing up just about three tenths of a percent all right let's take a look at AT&T another important mover to keep on your radar that stock closing up about six and a half percent today the pop coming after the company released its latest earnings report before the bell the company produced earnings per share of 61 cents coming in higher than the streets estimate of 57 cents but really it appears to be those subscriber numbers that are pushing the stock higher AT&T added 217 million total subscribers across all divisions that top the streets estimate by just about two million profit a free cash flow outlook missed the streets expectations but certainly Dave looks like those subscriber numbers clearly the huge headline and that is what Wall Street is focusing on in this report. Yeah John Stanky ecstatic the CEO about those numbers saying this marks the best ten quarter stretch of wireless growth in more than a decade for AT&T which is really a shocking number when you consider the environment that we're in at the moment and for the exclamation park point Stanky says what's our strategy it's quite simple do it again so not a whole lot to analyze they're pretty pleased with their performance wants to keep it up. Certainly are pleased with the performance and it looks like that strategy has been paying off when you look at the new phone sub 656 million it is important to point out that they are offering still some promotions here that of course weighing on their business a bit they're spending on that 5G expansion they're spending on the phone giveaways to bring in those new users that is costing AT&T just a bit but clearly subscribers they are moving towards AT&T we're seeing that reflected in those numbers. And that friends is what's moving the markets today.","Shopify's stock surged 11% after announcing price increases that could generate $350 million in incremental revenue. Boeing's shares slightly rose despite missing revenue estimates due to supply chain and labor issues, while AT&T's stock rose 6.5% due to strong subscriber numbers.Boeing's fourth-quarter earnings missed revenue estimates at $19.98 billion, with an adjusted loss per share of $1.75, causing its stock to teeter near the flatline."
71,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmoVypZaOfA,BmoVypZaOfA," Let's get you up to speed on this afternoon's market action because as you can see, we are well off the lows of the day. The Dow was off over 400 points off 460 points earlier in today's trading action just a couple of hours after that opening bell. You can see we are just below the flat line off just about seven points right now. S&P also well off the lows of the day now off just about a tenth of a percent. The Nasdaq composite. A lot of those larger cap tech names are under pressure earlier in earlier trading. That was causing some of the losses that we were seeing across the board. But the Nasdaq composite now only off about a quarter of a percent. So recouping some of those earlier losses. Taking a look at the bond market very quickly. You see the 10 year yield off just a fraction here. Still just around 346. Digging into some of those individual movers and starting inside the Dow. You're looking at Microsoft off just about two tenths of a percent. I'll talk a little bit more about that drop that we're seeing more broadly speaking in tech. But I also want to bring to your attention the gains that we are seeing in Boeing. Boeing reported before the bell this morning despite that miss on both the top and bottom lines. Looking at Boeing back in the green in today's trading action trading up just about one percent. Taking a look at some of the bank stocks here. The Outperformer Capital One. They reported after the bell yesterday. You can see it up just over nine percent today leading the way. Lots of green on the screen. We're taking a look at the XLF, the financial sector here, some of those larger banks. Capital One, the leader here when we take a look at the S&P, the top performing stock in the S&P today. Taking a look at that sector action there. I mentioned banks leading the way with financials up just around seven tenths of a percent. Consumer discretionary also holding on to gains. On the flip side, you can see utilities by far the underperformer off just over one and a half percent. XLI also off just about four tenths of a percent. Taking a look at some of those tech names. Microsoft, the drop there, a lot of that having to do with the guidance that initially spooked the street. You can see some of those larger tech names still under pressure today. Dave, we're looking at Alphabet off just about two and a half percent. Apple also in the red today. I think what we learned over the last 24 hours is we rushed to judgment with these earnings. We're so in a hurry to break them down and analyze them, we need to give it some time. That's a warning for Tesla because that comes out after hours. We will see a jump to conclusion. And also just how important the earnings calls are too. Yes, two things. There's so much stuff that goes on in these earnings calls when we hear from executives that really moves the stock the next day or during the trading day. Patience, my friend.","Stocks initially declined, but the Dow recovered to a loss of only 7 points and the S&P was down less than 0.1%. Capital One and Boeing gained, while tech stocks like Microsoft and Alphabet declined. Analysts advised patience during earnings calls.The afternoon market session saw the Dow recovering from earlier losses of 460 points to trade just below the flatline with a decrease of about seven points, while the S&P 500 also rebounded to be down around a tenth of a percent. The NASDAQ Composite, which had been under pressure earlier, managed to recoup some losses and was down only about a quarter of a percent. In the bond market, the 10-year yield remained around 3.46%. Among individual stocks, Microsoft dropped by approximately two tenths of a percent, while Boeing gained around one percent despite missing revenue and earnings expectations. Capital One led the gains in the financial sector, rising over nine percent after their earnings report. The financial sector as a whole was up around seven tenths of a percent, with consumer discretionary stocks also holding gains. On the downside, utilities were the underperformer, dropping over one and a half percent, along with the XLI sector which was down about four tenths of a percent. In the tech sector, larger names like Microsoft and Alphabet faced pressure, both being down around two and a half percent, while Apple was also in the red. The importance of patience in analyzing earnings and the impact of earnings calls on stock movement were highlighted, especially as Tesla's earnings release was awaited."
72,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKcNe5oe_ag,eKcNe5oe_ag," Let's get you up to speed now on Big Tech. Shana talked a lot about it there, what a difference a day makes for Microsoft. The stock down after it was well up earlier in the day, but that was not the case when they released earnings Tuesday after the bell. That's when the stock rose 5% after hours initially after everyone jumped at what looked like a pretty solid report, RBC analyst Rishi Jalloria telling us at the time the numbers were quote, better than feared. Then came the call and a look under the hood at Microsoft revenue growth slowing to a six year low. CEO Satya Nadella saying on the call organizations are exercising caution given the macroeconomic uncertainty. We got further guidance from their CFO Amy Hood who said results weakened through December and should further slow in coming months. Again kind of a lesson to wait for that call. We will certainly analyze Tesla the second they come out and do our best, but you need to give it some time and you need to hear that call before you truly analyze what it means for the next step, the next quarter, the next year. Yeah exactly and also what it could mean for some of its competitors out there because initially after Microsoft released earnings yesterday when there was a lot of excitement about those numbers, particularly what we saw from the Azure from their cloud division that actually sparked a bit of a rally in Amazon shares in extended trading yesterday. Of course the reverse happened today with Amazon under pressure as well as a lot of the larger tech names or names focused on the cloud because of that guidance number what we got from Microsoft in their earnings call. Despite all this, despite the concern that we are seeing on the stream, despite the fact they were looking at some losses today, although you can see we're well off the lows of the day when you're taking a look at some of those larger tech names. The street remains positive on Microsoft City reiterating once again that Microsoft is best positioned among large cap software names, offering investors a good mix of growth and profitability. We also have Morgan Stanley maintaining that overweight rating there. All right, Microsoft pulling the rest of the market down with it. You can see the Dow still in negative territory though, well off the lows of the day. We're looking at a two day chart there on an intraday basis. We are now actually in positive territory in the final hour trading up just about 17.","Microsoft's stock initially rose 5% after their earnings report, but fell after concerns over slowing revenue growth and weak guidance were revealed in their earnings call. However, analysts remain positive on the company's growth and profitability. Microsoft's revenue growth has slowed to a six-year low.  The broader market, including the Dow, was impacted by Microsoft's performance but has shown some recovery in the final hours of trading."
73,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEpV3H-w9ZU,QEpV3H-w9ZU," A mistaken upload by BlockFi now reveals the crypto lender had over $1.2 billion in assets tied up between Sam Bank, McFreed's FTX and Alameda Research. Well, for more on the implications for the crypto space and BlockFi creditors, let's get to Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith. David, I mean, what an unfortunate update. Yeah, so last night, N3 Partners, an advisor for BlockFi's unsecured creditors committee, mistakenly made this upload. And the mistake is that a lot of the information was unredacted in a presentation. And the presentation showed that the crypto lending platform had about $1.2 billion tied up with FTX and its related trading firm, Alameda Research. And as we know, FTX bailed out BlockFi over the summer, then swiftly sent it into bankruptcy in November after FTX collapsed. And that $1.2 billion included $415 million in assets held with FTX in addition to about $830 billion in loans to Alameda. Now, the number was reported at BlockFi's first bankruptcy hearing as being $1 billion, and obviously has since risen. The presentation, which has been removed as of now, and we'll see if that stands to be the case, given that it's already been revealed to the public, also showed that after adjustments, BlockFi has about $1.3 billion in assets, which is a little less than half of which is liquid, meaning it's easily sellable. The document also showed that between the period of May 2022 and up to its bankruptcy filing, approximately 73% of its 6,000, or excuse me, 662,000 customers were retail investors with $1,000 or less in their accounts. Now, this is all to say bankruptcy claims for BlockFi at this point in time are selling at about $0.23 on the dollar. So then as people wonder what this means for some of these crypto companies, are there any implications here for Coinbase's quarterly results? How bad could the damage be? Yeah, I mean, Coinbase got ahead of some of the news or some of its Q4 earnings earlier in January by releasing preliminary statements on it. And we already have a lot of data outside of that based on its crypto trading volume, which is publicly available. But to put it into perspective, crypto exchanges have been grappling with what can be described as a huge loss of customer confidence since FTX. Coinbase is a standout exchange, being that it's one of the only publicly listed crypto currency. It's the only publicly listed crypto currency exchange. And broadly speaking, during the entire year of 2022, cryptocurrency prices declined on average by about 64%. And Coinbase's revenue is heavily tied to trading volume. And Coinbase's CEO has also pointed out that they expect revenue to decline by half or more for the whole 2022 year. Now, in terms of what we can expect for Q4, the company's trading volume declined by about 9% compared to its third quarter. So we should expect things to be worse. Analysts are anticipating an earnings per share loss of between $2.39 and $2.49. And those are estimates, obviously, at this point in time. We have about three weeks until Coinbase does report Q4 earnings. And of course, the company has also announced a plan to lay off 20% of its staff earlier this month. And that will be between Q4 and Q1 of 2023, with the aim to cut operating expenses by about 25%. So over 2022, Coinbase cut about, or I guess we could say since cryptocurrency prices plunged, Coinbase has cut about 2,000 workers. So the big question here is whether or not these cuts are going to impact this development of becoming sort of what it's been hoping to do is more than just a crypto trading venue. But that being said for the quarter, I think that we're going to see them focusing heavily on crypto trading volumes. And we'll want to see if FTX at all, the collapse of it impacted their exchange or customer levels on the positive side. We'll certainly be keeping an eye on that. We're seeing a lot more retail investors now relying on hard wallets and trying to come off some of these exchanges in light of what happened with FTX. Great update there. Dave Hollerith there. Thank you so much.","BlockFi's mistaken disclosure of $1.2 billion in funds tied up with FTX and Alameda Research caused concerns for their creditors.

74,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7ZYr4_4HFs,v7ZYr4_4HFs," A former senior executive in the luxury automotive industry now leading a new cannabis lifestyle brand looking to cater to affluent high-class consumers. Mark Del Rosso, Liberty founder and CEO joining us now to discuss his shift from luxury vehicles to navigating the cannabis market. Thank you for joining me today, Mark. So this is quite the shift. Talk us through how you got from your previous industry in automotives to now cannabis. Well, thank you. And thank you for having Libert�� today. First, I think I start with the journey from automotive into the cannabis. At the root and at the essence is really a personal belief. When I contrast the two from an automotive perspective, I always believed in transportation and the freedom that comes with transportation. When I look at the cannabis market, I have a deep belief in the plant, the cannabis plant, and the freedom to express yourself through the plant and the benefits of the plant. When I look at the opportunity and to contrast the two, in the opportunity in automotive, I'm fascinated what's happening with battery electric vehicles as an example. I read a statistic by 2030, 50% will be battery electric vehicles. And I learned more and more about the cannabis industry, an industry that's going to grow to 70 billion by 2030. It really provided an opportunity to lead. 68% of Americans believe that cannabis should be federally legal, 34 states medical, 21 recreationally legal. So it really gave us an opportunity at Libert�� to found a company that is really specifically around a modern high design cannabis company, really focused on a discerning audience. And we really believe that that audience is into culture, status and sophistication, and they want the very best. In addition, when I look at the journey, I think about the ability to innovate and taking automotive as an example, alternative propulsion, battery electric vehicles. When I think about the cannabis market as well, clearly an opportunity to innovate and pioneer in the space of solventless extraction as an example, direct to consumer and really around our company, Libert��US.com, it really gives us the opportunity to design and curate from products to experience. So it's been an incredible journey. I'm learning a lot. I want to ask you, are you expecting much crossover in your high end clientele in cars and your high end clientele that you're catering to as your website has launched today? I guess you're going to be rolling out in California and other accessories along the way. Yes, well, thank you for that. We do believe that there's a crossover and quite candidly, again, going back to the consumer and we serve the consumer, our mission is to elevate cannabis in society. And when we think about that discerning consumer, we think that we have the ability, again, to curate around that. I believe, you know, from a launch perspective, we'll launch in the spring a full lineup of lifestyle products available throughout the United States and then premium cannabis products in the state of California with a passion around solventness will focus primarily on the Los Angeles area and then expand throughout the state of California. But yes, we see that crossover because we do have the access and we do have the credibility. And so, Mark, I want to ask you, obviously, in terms of the regulatory environment, it is a bit piecemeal. It is quite patchwork. How do you see that affecting how your business grows from here? Yeah, I think it's interesting and we're learning an awful lot. And I really love Elon Musk bringing up the whole idea of first principles and really getting down to the truths and then reasoning up from there. And I think that it's important when we look at regulation, again, I believe in America. And again, as I stated, 68 percent of Americans want cannabis to be federally legal. And the reality is, when I think about that and I think about the truth, the lessons learned, whether it's in California, New York is now coming online, there's an opportunity to continue to innovate and continue to get better. And that's where we think pioneering is so important. And also, I think the legislation will follow always getting better and always reasoning up. And obviously, people are wondering perhaps about some of these price points for the products and services versus say what you might get at a dispensary. What sort of price points are we looking at? Yeah, for us at Libert��, again, if you want to learn more about our company, it's Libert��US.com. We really believe that our pricing reflects that idea of creating the best in class value for the client. It's really a connoisseur grade and the curation of the finest. So our range will be anywhere from $50 to $1,000. But again, it's creating value within the segment and within the industry. I mean, we've seen luxury buyers, you know, stick with it even through inflation. So I'm guessing perhaps if that's the market here as well on this crossover, you might see that growth there too. A big thank you there to Mark Del Rosso there, Libert�� founder and CEO. Thank you for joining me today.","Mark Del Rosso, former senior executive in luxury automotive, becomes CEO of cannabis lifestyle brand Libert��, planning to launch premium cannabis products in California and a full lineup of lifestyle products in the US, targeting discerning consumers with a focus on solventless extraction.The projected growth of the cannabis industry to $70 billion by 2030. 68% of Americans believe cannabis should be federally legal. 34 states have legalized cannabis for medical use. 21 states have legalized cannabis for recreational use.

75,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QY5imZFeGc8,QY5imZFeGc8," 2023 is the year to put your money to work, but a real tangible assets, the better bet. Let's take a closer look at the infrastructure behind energy, agribusiness and the bearish sentiment holding back investments in Europe. Joining us now is Greg Swenson, Brigg Macadam founding partner. Good to have you on the show, Greg. So I know that we mentioned in Europe there, you're saying it's not the time to buy at least not yet. What are some of the factors that are driving that outlook? Yeah, I think there's maybe too much optimism right now because the winter wasn't as bad as people expected. It was a relatively or so far a relatively warm winter and the Europeans led by the Germans were able to cobble together enough energy supplies. So the energy crisis is not quite as bad as a lot of the market expected. But I think that doesn't really help us next year in terms of, you know, energy supplies. So I think that's the real concern. Last year, you still have some inflation, you know, in spite of the fact that the Germans and other countries were able to get some supplies in and the winter's been kind to the market, you still have much higher energy inflation in Europe and that's a headwind to the market. So look, I don't think long term it's such a bad move. In fact, if you look at the worst performers of last year, you know, small cap Europe was as well as small cap US for that matter, were some of the real laggards. So I think there will be a time once we get through some of the headwinds, see how earnings are in Europe relatively or historically, it's relatively cheap to the US markets. So I think there is going to be some opportunity and because it, you know, small cap Europe really lagged last year, I think when the Fed is done, when the ECB is close to done with tightening and you start to see a potential move back to easing toward the end of this year and early 24, it might be, it'll be time to dip your toes into the European markets. So Greg, we know what you're not keen on, but what about the work, what you are keen on? You're talking about some of these more tangible investments, break down some of that because you talk about alternatives and real assets here. And part of it is the timing, you know, the last year, you know, since the Russia invasion You know, you saw an elevated interest in critical infrastructure, notably in food security and energy security. You know, that's not something that's changed for us. It just, as I said, elevated it to front page news, but energy infrastructure, food security and energy security have been exceptional non-correlated and inflation protected investments. So in whatever your view is on inflation, whether it's coming down or whether this is a bit of a, of a head fake, you can invest in real assets that are critical infrastructure and really address the basic needs. So there's a lot of opportunity in those sectors. And we would advise looking for opportunities, especially in emerging markets. You saw, you know, EM, Latin America performed really well last year in terms of fixed income because it's correlated to commodities. You'll see that opportunity in Africa and other emerging markets and frontier markets that are correlated to commodities. So we long-term view on critical infrastructure is still very positive. And what about in the shorter term and the midterm? I know that you're also keeping an eye on the real estate investment as well. What sort of trends are you looking at? What are the factors that really make for a good investment in real estate right now? I think, look, you know, there's still some headwinds. I think, you know, you've got obviously high vacancy rates in the office sector, especially in cities like Chicago, which you should probably avoid. But I think, you know, that it was speaking of sectors that did really poorly last year, real estate was one of them. So I think as, as the mood shifts later this year from, you know, getting through the recession, regardless of your view on whether it's going to be severe or not, or even a soft landing, as the sentiment changes toward the end of the year, I think a move into the real estate sector in general. And then also, you know, we look at opportunities in emerging markets. I mentioned Africa, but also in Latin America and Asia. You know, if you have markets that have underperformed, the most important thing in those markets is if it's dollar correlated and you have offtakes in dollars or, and especially with good credit leases, I think that's a real opportunity. And we see a lot of interest in those sectors. So for perhaps newer investors who are wondering, should I hold on to my cash? Should I try and enter the market through it through an ETF? How would you advise them in terms of making the decision as to where the way they should be heading right now, since there is so much uncertainty in the economic backdrop? Right now, to me, it seems really obvious if you could, you could buy T bills at, you know, in the fours, you know, four and a half percent for six month bills, roughly, you know, that I think is a great way to get through this uncertainty, get through some near term volatility with this inverted yield curve, you know, hold off on long duration assets, both long duration equities like tech. I think the tech rally was premature. The valuations aren't that cheap. And same with long duration fixed income. You have an inverted yield curve. So put your money to work for six months in T bills or, you know, or high quality money markets that are, you know, in four and a half to five and a half percent. You know, why wouldn't you do that for the near term and then start to make some long term rotation decisions toward mid year or toward the end of the year? And in the meantime, stay defensive. All right, there you go. Stay defensive. Greg Swenson there. Brigham Academy founding partner, thank you for joining me. Thank you for your time.","Investing in alternative assets like infrastructure, energy, and agribusiness is recommended by Greg Swenson, founding partner of Brigham Macadam. He also advises buying T-bills for the near term and suggests emerging markets as potential investment opportunities."
76,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJVeDwcdBrs,JJVeDwcdBrs," Alright, well Amazon's clashes with unions continues. Workers in the UK staging a day-long strike over wages and working conditions. The action marks the first time the e-commerce giant is seen in that country. Here with more is Yahoo Finance's Alexandria Garfinkel. Hey Ali, how are you? Good to see you, Rochelle. So the UK strike is expected to last 24 hours. It started at midnight and it's important to say off the cuff that though this is the first strike we've seen in the UK, this didn't happen overnight. These workers in this Coventry warehouse have been very outspoken since last year about their working conditions. They've been working with the GMB union, which is a general trade union in the UK. And this strike in particular, they actually voted for it at the end of last year. So I think this shows the extent to which organizing at Amazon has really begun to have a playbook. And that playbook, of course, has been heavily influenced by the Amazon labor union. Its victory in Sadden Island did change the game last year simply by proving that it was possible. Of course, if you're Amazon right now, this is a headache you don't want. You're coming into a very important earnings, one of the most high stakes earnings you've seen in a while. And this is just another distraction. This is something that is going to be playing out for them for a long time. And the fact it's coming to a head right now, I'm sure isn't exactly what they were hoping for. And, you know, investors really keeping an eye on the domino effect of some of the success that these unions have seen. Now, this most recent strike action, indicating some momentum for unionization at Amazon. How are these efforts positioned in 2023? That's a great question, Rochelle, because on one hand, there's momentum and you cannot overstate how important momentum is to a union effort. These efforts are massively benefit from momentum. And the fact that COVID changed things for workers, changed what they were willing to talk about, what they were willing to organize for, is something that I think a lot of these unions and a lot of these efforts are still absolutely riding on. On the other hand, you have Amazon and you know they're going to fight unionization tooth and nail. And workers have this incredible task, then, of outlasting Amazon. Bargaining periods are already more than a year, about 465 days. And Amazon has shown with the Amazon Labor Union's victory that it will fight even certifying wins at all. So for workers who are even just waiting it out here, it's going to be a tall order in 2023. Certainly does seem to be an uphill battle, but seeing some success, though, at least for unions, a big thank you there, Ali Garfinkel.","Amazon workers in a UK warehouse strike for 24 hours over wages and working conditions, showing momentum for unionization efforts that Amazon is expected to fight against aggressively.The strike was planned since the previous year and indicates growing momentum for unionization efforts at Amazon. The company's history of opposing unionization and the lengthy bargaining periods pose challenges for the workers' efforts. "
77,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKZzvFKzVtg,VKZzvFKzVtg," Right, well, let's kick things off with Microsoft shares sliding into the red following its latest earnings report as a tech giant leaves investors weary with its downbeat outlook as it sees further growth slowdown in the cloud. What could this all signal for the rest of the mega tech names? Here with the details as Yahoo! Finances' Dan Howley. Hey, Dan. Hello, Michelle. We have Microsoft reports slowing cloud sales in the quarter and it was not as bad as seemingly analysts had expected. But the bigger problem was the Q3 guidance that Microsoft had issued basically saying that look, we're going to continue to see deceleration in this cloud area as a result of the broader macroeconomic conditions. And so this has been something that's been going on for quite some time. It's not necessarily just this quarter. So it's surprising to see analysts react when they said that they saw better than expected results from the cloud business. The acceleration that we saw from sales during the pandemic was astronomical for sure, but we've seen them come down quite quickly as a result of that kind of pullback. And so now moving forward, we're expecting to see further deceleration. I think the other thing to point out for sure is the PC market. That really kind of stung Microsoft hard. They were down 39% for their Windows OEM business. That's where they basically sell Windows licenses to PC manufacturers. And as a result of that slowdown in the market, we're seeing this pullback in the number of people that are going out and buying PCs. And that also applies to their own Windows hardware business where we also saw slowdown as well. So, you know, overall, this doesn't paint a great picture for other cloud service providers or PC manufacturers. We have Intel reporting tomorrow as far as the chip side of things, so we'll get a better look at what that means for hardware. But for the cloud, it could spell trouble for the likes of Amazon and AWS and Google and their Google Cloud platform. And obviously, Dan, a lot of people turned to these tech companies when they didn't have a choice during lockdown. So we knew there was going to be sort of an untangling of this as consumer demand changes. You have to wonder, though, is Microsoft any better or worse positioned than some of these other big tech companies? It's interesting because they are the second largest by volume cloud provider on Earth, just behind Amazon. Google is in third, followed by a slew of others. But as far as how they've managed to package and offer their kind of cloud products, they've done a great job. And so, once we start to see perhaps a kind of push forward as far as companies going out and starting to rebuy some of the cloud offerings, then that could really start to improve for Microsoft. They purchased, obviously, or didn't purchase, but invested that $10 billion in chat GPT creator OpenAI. That should spell good news for them down the line, especially since it's not just chat GPT. That's just a chat bot. It's the technology behind that. I know a lot of people have discussed chat GPT being kind of the big, interesting product that's available. But it's the technology behind that that provides that natural language conversational that you'll have with the AI. And so that's something that I think obviously helps Microsoft differentiate itself, especially since Microsoft is going to be the exclusive cloud provider for OpenAI and what it has to offer. They're doing all of this calculations and activity in the cloud through OpenAI. So that really does give Microsoft a boom.","Microsoft's slowing cloud sales and downbeat outlook could impact other cloud providers and PC manufacturers, but their investment in OpenAI and differentiated technology behind chat GPT offer potential for improvement in the future.Microsoft reported slowing cloud sales in the quarter, with Q3 guidance indicating continued deceleration in the cloud area due to macroeconomic conditions. The PC market also negatively impacted Microsoft's performance, with a 39.9% decline in Windows OEM business. This situation could pose challenges for other cloud service providers and PC manufacturers, including Amazon, AWS, Google, and their cloud platforms."
78,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKgKwO8YC9w,yKgKwO8YC9w," Well, it's a big week for tech as Microsoft earnings kicks things off with a less than desired outcome as its worrisome guidance hits other mega tech names. We're here to dig deeper on Microsoft and the rest of the tech space is Robert Stimpson, Oak Associates Co-CIO. Good to see you, Robert. So as we were taking a look through some of the revenue drivers there for Microsoft, Azure stood out and we know that you said that that's one to watch. But obviously getting a lot of the headlines is that investment in OpenAI. If you're Microsoft, how should you be putting your capital to work right now? Well, we think the OpenAI investment into CHET, GPT, is the type of decision you want to see from a mega cap tech name like Microsoft. We do not want to see them sacrifice those opportunities to the likes of Google or Amazon or Facebook. So we're encouraged by that sort of investment for the future. And so as we look at Azure especially and where it's going from here and then when you compare it to what we're seeing with the cloud business, some of these growth drivers that allow them to be able to pour innovation into these other sectors. What are your expectations for the cloud business? Well, the cloud is certainly the growth business for Microsoft. And when we look at the stock today, you know, it's really a tale of two cities. They have the PC business, which is slowing and mature, and then they have growth in the cloud business. And, you know, that's definitely the area that the market is watching. It's been successful and a little softening going forward is to be expected, because after all, this is a 52 billion dollar revenue company. It's hard to maintain that revenue growth. And I understand that businesses are kind of rationalizing their spend after two years of trying to be more efficient, more productive coming out of covid. And so, Robert, then I know that one of the negatives that you highlighted was the current valuation, especially when you look at, say, a Google or a Meta. How are you when you think of where the valuations might go from here? What do you think might actually work in Microsoft's favor since they do still have such a high valuation? Well, I think they've been benefiting from the idea that that as a mega cap tech company, there is some safety and security in their in their size and their market cap. But when you when you separate Microsoft into those two industries of being a legacy PC company and a growth cloud company, the valuation multiple should probably somewhere in between of those two businesses. And unfortunately, it's not. It's definitely more towards the higher end at 24 times next year's earnings, price to sales of almost nine times. Those are pretty rich multiples when other tech names have similar growth opportunities but are trading at much more reasonable valuations, whether it's Google at 18 times earnings or Facebook at 13 times earnings, other mega cap names just don't have that premium. And we think that the upside is still good in those areas. And so when we look at some of the issues that we're still dragging in for 2022, the macroeconomic back down, Fed continuing to tighten, albeit at a slower pace, when you look at some of the perhaps the potential for the biggest winners this earnings season in tech, who stands out to you? Well, we do like the semiconductor space. People forget it's a boom and bust cycle in semiconductors. And we had some supply disruptions during the pandemic, but valuations have contracted sharply. China is reopening. The appetite for semiconductors is still very strong. So as an industry, there's some inventory that needs to be worked off in some of the more industrial automotive and PC names. But it's still a growth industry that you can get access to at a much more reasonable valuation, knowing that has a long tail of growth behind it. And Robert, I want to ask you about about layoffs. Obviously, we've seen Microsoft part of that as well with its own set of 10,000 layoffs. Haven't heard anything from Apple yet. Apple have done hiring freezes, but haven't made those cuts yet. Do we expect much deeper cuts overall for tech? And why do you think we haven't seen it for Apple yet? You know, that's a good question. I expect we probably will at some point. All of the tech companies were aggressive in hiring during the pandemic. They kind of benefited from the work from home trade and enabling other companies to move to a more distributed workforce environment. And then there's going to need to be some rationalization of that workforce going forward. So I think that the the layoffs we've seen from a lot of the major tech companies is probably just round one. I think Microsoft hired something like seventy five thousand people over the last four years. And last year, headcount was up over 19 percent. So as these tech companies make their own expense reductions, headcount is going to be a big area. And Robert, of course, we know that Tesla is reporting after the bell, but I do want to ask you about Musk. A lot of people, especially investors, frustrated about the distractions. You have Twitter, you have the ongoing shareholder lawsuit. How do you think this is all going to pan out for Tesla since it does have some very ambitious production targets now? Well, you know, Tesla has a great product, a great car, but the stock has been very volatile and Elon's personality is affecting its share price. So while the underlying product is good, you know, the the high valuation, as well as some significant changes in the competitive environment over the last two years, I think every major automaker now has a lineup of EVs available and Tesla is no longer, you know, the best option for some people. So given the changes in the competitive landscape, you know, the tech, the stock's been under pressure. Elon's been a little bit of a distraction. And as a result, it may not ever receive the premium fan base or valuation that it had enjoyed previously. Certainly is a very different time we're living in now in the EV space. Robert Simpson, their Oak Associates, co-CIO. Thank you for joining me this morning.","The interview covers Microsoft's earnings, including their investment in OpenAI and Azure, as well as Tesla's stock volatility, tech layoffs, and Microsoft's valuation."
79,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAXPFSooSrw,CAXPFSooSrw," All right, well, earning season is in full swing. And while Microsoft may be the talk on the street today, we're taking a look at some of the other biggest movers of the day with Yahoo Finance's Ines Farre. Ines, what are you watching? Well, Rochelle, I'm watching the number two trending ticker on Yahoo Finance behind Microsoft, and that would be Boeing after Boeing reported its quarterly results. Take a look at our Wi-Fi interactive board. That's the Dow, all three components of the Dow there. And you can see Boeing, one of the biggest laggards on the Dow, down almost 3% after a fourth quarter loss of $1.75 per share, missing estimates, Wall Street estimates of a profit. Its revenue came in at $19.98 billion. That was also a miss. Some commentary from analyst Cowen saying that the results miss suggest a broad-based softness in operations. You still, though, have 19 buys and six hold zero sells on this stock. Another stock that I'm also taking a look at is in the semiconductor space, and that would be Texas Instruments after the company reported its quarterly results. The stock down almost 2%. That's partly because of the biggest sales decline for Texas Instruments since 2020. The company also issued weaker than expected guidance, saying that it's seeing a slowing demand across different industries, except for the auto industry. And Texas Instruments is an important stock to look at, an important company to look at, because it has almost 100,000 customers worldwide across different industries. So you can really get a gauge of where we're at with these semiconductors. And then just taking a look at ASML, this is a company that manufactures equipment for making semiconductors. And it topped its earnings forecast. Its sales grew. It's going to grow in 2023. That is according to their predictions, their projections. But it did call out the Chinese controls on exports and that this could impact the company, because the chip technology has sort of become a security concern. When it comes to China, ASML warning that excessive export controls could inflate chip costs. It could also impact supply chains. Some of the top customers, by the way, for ASML is TSMC and also Samsung and also Intel. So another important company to watch because they make the equipment for making semiconductors.","Boeing's Q4 results showed a loss per share of $1.75, leading to a 3% drop in their stock. Texas Instruments' sales declined except for the auto industry, and ASML warned of potential impact from Chinese export controls. Its revenue came in at $19.98 billion, which also fell short."

Yahoo Finance tech editor Dan Howley has the numbers for us. Dan, what stands out to you? That's right, Microsoft missed slightly on the top line but beat on earnings per share. Revenue came in at 52.7 billion. Expectations were for 52.9 billion, so you see that little miss there. Adjusted EPS came in at $2.32 a share. That's versus expectations of $2.30 per share. Let me just run through the businesses that they have. The productivity and business processes came in at 17 billion. That's better than expected of 16.8 billion. Intelligent Cloud, that came in at 21.5 billion. That's versus the 21.4 billion that was expected, so a beat there. And then more personal computing, that obviously has taken a beating. 14.2 billion versus the 14.7 billion that was expected. CEO Satya Nadella said the next major wave of computing is born as Microsoft Cloud turns the world's most advanced AI models into new computing platforms. That clearly a reference to their multi-year, multi-billion dollar investment in open AI, which is meant to help them better tackle competitors like Amazon and Google, not to mention enterprise services like Salesforce.","Microsoft beats expectations with strong cloud business growth, Capital One misses Q4 EPS estimates with increased credit loss provisions, Texas Instruments sales drop but surpass Wall Street's expectations, and Fox sees an increase in stock value after Rupert Murdoch withdraws sale proposal.

Microsoft Capital One, Texas Instruments and Fox. Let's kick it off with Microsoft. You're looking at gains of just about 4% here after hours. The company beating expectations when it comes to adjusted EPS $2.32. The estimate was for $2.30. Revenue just a bit light there, $52.75 billion. Estimate was for $52.93 billion. But the cloud business growth there, that's what's really driving the stock here after hours. Intelligent cloud revenue beating the street's expectations, $21.51 billion. That's growth of about 18%. Growth of 24% in constant currency. Again, you're looking at the stock pop here, up about 4% after hours. And competitor Amazon, AWS, the cloud number there, boosting Amazon's stock after hours. You're looking at Amazon's gains of just about 3%. Let's take a look at Capital One. That stock under pressure here following its earnings report off just over 1.5%. Their fourth quarter EPS missed the street's expectations, coming in just about a dollar below. At $2.82. The estimate was for $3.79. Revenue a slight beat there, just over $9 billion. Provisions for credit losses higher than what the street was looking for here, $2.42 billion. The estimate was for $1.85 billion. The indicator of the broader economic environment and the downturn maybe that we could potentially see here over the coming months. Car delinquency and also auto delinquency. Both of those numbers growth up about over on a year over year basis. We're looking at losses of just about 1.5%. Taking a look at Texas Instruments, that stock now back in positive territory after hours, up just about 2.1% sales though, dropping for the first time since 2020. They also offered a pretty tepid forecast. Some of their expectations there at the lower end of Wall Street's range. Taking a look at some of these numbers, revenue declining 3.4% year over year, but it was better than what the street was looking for. They reported $4.67 billion. The estimate was for $4.61 billion. EPS $2.13. That was better than what the street was looking for. Gains of just about 2.0%. Also keep a close eye on Fox and News Corp. We just brought you the news of Rupert Murdoch withdrawing his proposal here to explore a potential sale of these two businesses. You're seeing Fox up after hours, up just about 1.5%. News Corp under a bit of pressure here off about the same as what Fox is up, off just about 1.5% here, Dave.

Things got animated at a town hall meeting with CEO Sundar Pichai, our own Ali Garfinkle is here to tell us more. And Ali, there's lots of unhappy Google employees right now. There are Shauna. I go so far to say that this didn't just get animated. It got to be pretty intense. This town hall really centered on employees demanding transparency for how these decisions were made. A lot of employees were laid off who weren't expecting it, who saw themselves or their laid off colleagues as high performers. And Sundar Pichai sat down and had a message for everyone. He said, nothing was random. What it actually revealed is he actually gave some insight into the process. And it appears that it was incredibly methodical. Even though this affected 12,000 employees, we know the process was exhaustive. At the town hall, he actually said that 750 senior leaders were involved in the decision making process and that it took multiple weeks. That said, these layoffs have possibly been in talks behind the scenes for a long time. These layoffs, one expert told me, are some of the most predictable that we've seen so far in big tech. Look back to November, for instance. TCI was calling on Google to start right sizing even then. And what it called for was these kind of cuts. It was calling for aggressive action. And that is on top of the fact that Google famously pays some of the highest salaries in Silicon Valley. The median employee pay at Google slash Alphabet in 2021, I believe, was $296,000 a year, which is more than Metta and a lot of its competitors. And Google's in a new moment. Alphabet's in a new moment. We're looking to compete for new AI driven revenues. And this moment of we're going to get leaner has been coming. It was methodical, is what Pashai said. That said, what this town hall has showed us, if anything, is that Google still has some work to do when it comes to saving face with its employees. It certainly does. Many are very upset right now. Ali Garfingo, thanks so much for the latest there.","Google CEO Sundar Pichai faced employee discontent over layoffs during a town hall meeting, with demands for transparency.

Sundar Pichai addressed the recent layoff of 12,000 employees, revealing that the decision-making process involved 750 senior leaders and took multiple weeks. The layoffs, although affecting a significant number, were considered methodical and possibly anticipated, with an activist investor calling for such cuts previously. The median employee salary at Google/Alphabet in 2021 was $296,000, higher than competitors like Meta.

It might though be part of a larger trend of Americans cutting back in order to afford the occasional luxury item. It's what the Wall Street Journal refers to as split brain budget. All the numbers reflect shoppers cutting back on everyday items because of inflation in a January morning console poll shows 30% of Americans have purchased a luxury item in the past month. I can relate to this. It makes you feel a little bit good, you know? It gives you some of that optimism, something that we all need right now. Dave, the poll also revealing that more than a third of that group spent over $100 on their purchase. When you take a look at some of these numbers, we talk about the fact that the luxury market has held up relatively well when you compare it to some of its other, some of the other names within the consumer space. Taking a look at a lot of those estimates out there, Bain estimates that the luxury market's consumer base is going to expand by about $100 million between now and 2030. Right now it's about $400 million. They're expecting that to get to $500 million by 2030. More Gen Z, more millennials spending, splurging on those luxury goods. We're already seeing it happen clearly because people need that pick-me-up these days. I hope you don't smack me with a Prada bag. Is this a female thing? I do not have split-brain budget. I do not buy luxury items right now. You spend some on clothes. No. No? This is like 10 years old. You have nice suits. Yeah, that's because they go to the cleaners a lot. I don't purchase luxury items full stop right now. I do cut back, largely speaking, trying to cut back on the Starbucks a little bit. So yes or no, you do think this is a male-female thing? I think it's a male-female thing. That's my interpretation of it. I just think that you're being smart. You're being frugal right now.

What do you think came out of that hearing today? And might they be broken up? Should they? Well, here's the critical question. How are consumers affected? And if you bought a ticket any time recently, you know by paying those super competitive charges for access to tickets that there's monopolists there and that monopolist is exercising their monopoly power. Quite unlike the situation with Google, there's direct consumer harm. Moreover, there's a very good case for separating the two companies. They're not integrated. There's not efficiencies that come about because the two firms are together. Rather, by bringing the two firms together, they've created a monopoly broth of exclusionary conduct. And the only way to sort of separate that broth is to break up the two companies.","Ticketmaster and Live Nation's merger has created a monopoly that could harm consumers, leading to calls for the two companies to be separated through a breakup."
87,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48k3WXm_668,48k3WXm_668," We're about 24 hours from Tesla's highly anticipated fourth quarter earnings release. Wedbush securities Dan Ives calling tomorrow's release and subsequent earnings call quote, one of the most important moments in the history of Tesla and Musk himself. Now we say that with the caveat, we love Dan a little prone to hyperbole at times, but it certainly is important for Tesla with their recent vehicle price cuts and year end delivery numbers likely already priced into the stock. Investors will be focused on how Tesla stacks up against expectations. The street looking for adjusted earnings per share of a dollar and 12 cents with revenue of 24.1 billion dollars. We'd love to hear more about margins, but we're certainly not in terms of those price cuts. That's really a Q1, maybe even Q2 story down the road, but maybe we hear from Mr. Musk on the call. Yeah, you got to think that an analyst or two are going to ask about that, the impact that it could potentially have on their business when you talk about some of that margin pressure from the price cuts. It also is going to be likely one of the first times CEO Elon Musk face questions publicly since he abruptly left a Twitter spaces with journalists in mid December. Just last month Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas saying in a note to clients today that he expects management to be upbeat about the positive reaction following Tesla's recent price cuts. But Jonas adds that quote, investors must have confidence that fiscal year earnings before seriously revisiting the stock, that process for investors should extend beyond Tesla's March 1st investor day. This is all according to Jonas. So again, a number of things will be unpacked in this earnings report. A lot of it will have to do with the demand side of it. Some of that obviously will likely be maybe helped here with those price cuts. I think it's safe to say that management will likely be hyping up the demand that they have just seen in the last week or so after that. But I think stepping back, talking about the tough backdrop that that Tesla is up against right now, obviously waiting demand could have been one of the huge reasons for those price cuts, but also that stiffer competition out there. And we saw a number of other EV makers, a number of the traditional automakers that are in the EV space, their their stocks under pressure following Tesla's price cut because the thought there is that they might then have to lower prices and put more pressure on their margins as well. So again, I think just a broad takeaway in terms of how strong or how weak the sector is right now and any trends that they could pull out, I think will certainly be a highlight in tomorrow's report. Really just want to hear about demand into this weakening economy. I'd love to ask him if you had a chance, how much time he is spending at Twitter versus Tesla. It's interesting because he has not been at SpaceX and we've seen, well, the stock, literally the valuation, a rocket ship. We'd like to hear about the Tesla semi. We'd like to hear about the Tesla cyber truck. We expect him to be on the call. In the last call he was on end of Q3, he said, looks like we'll have an epic end of year. I don't know how you define epic, but I think he was spot on about that in terms of the magnitude of the developments for Tesla because they started with the price cuts in China, which are received very poorly. And then once they were really absorbed, they performed very well. Same thing here. We heard analysts very critical of those price cuts, but then it's pop demand at North American stores and so it looks like a win-win there for him. It's going to be a very interesting report, very fascinating call. One question for him. Well, I was going to say, we also haven't even mentioned the cyber truck that might come up just in terms of the plans for there. The semi truck, the additional plans that they have made. Did you mention the cyber truck? I mentioned the cyber truck. You know you're talking so much. I know I'm talking too quickly. I apologize. Well, I was going to say, there's just so much to dig into when it comes to this report in terms of the headlines that we could get out. A lot of it also has to do with some of those factories, too. Some of their new plants that they have made in Nevada, Mexico, Indonesia, any color there, I think will certainly be something that investors will want to know. And we will have full coverage of Tesla's reports minutes after the release right here on Yahoo Finance. Be sure to tune in to our live special here with Brad Smith, Brian Sazi, after the earnings call tomorrow evening. You're not going to want to miss that.","Tesla's Q4 earnings report is highly anticipated, with investors looking for adjusted earnings per share of $1.12 and revenue of $24.1 billion.

88,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEo2f06Up7E,WEo2f06Up7E," Alright, we're just now a couple of minutes away from the closing bell, so let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Jared Blickery to break down the market action post-glitch. Post-glitch, hopefully everything works out in the close, guys. We'll talk about that in a second, but the Dow up about a third of a percent, Nasdaq down a quarter percent, S&P 500 right in the middle, just down slightly, Russell 2000 off about 14 basis points. Not a whole lot of action today in the indices, but we got some stuff going on underneath the surface. We got split here, we got industrials, utilities, real estate, staples, financials, materials, all of those outperforming most of the cyclical sectors up there, or some of the cyclical sectors, but also some of the defensive ones, so pretty interesting. Real estate, staples, utilities, those are the defensive ones. To the downside, healthcare, communication services, and energy, those are the biggest losers. And just checking on our leaders here, we have ITA, haven't seen Transports lead in a while, that's a one and a half percent bet, that's the gambling ETF. That's getting some love here, but for the most part you're going to see more losers than winners here. ARK Invest, that's down one and a half percent, and let's just take a look at ARK here. Just about everything in the red, not a whole lot of dark red today, so I am paying attention to where we're seeing the Shopify, Coinbase, Roku, Pindu, actually PagerDuty, those are some of the names and a lot of those software names that are down today. Want to focus on Tesla here, because we got earnings after the bell tomorrow, today is Microsoft, tomorrow is Tesla, and we're going to be keeping that, watching that here for you and breaking that news. Tesla is up 16% year to day, but let's take a look over the last two years so we can see what's going on here. Now we all know this, the top here was October of a couple years ago, and we are down considerably, sold off about 60% from those highs, still down about 50%, even though we are off considerably from those lows. Now tomorrow the options market is implying a move of about 10.7%, so you take the current price right here, 143, multiply it by 10%, so that's about $14, you add that to that, subtract it, you got a nice collar for what traders are expecting the move to be, so keep that in mind as we head into the bell and after the bell tomorrow. But in the meantime, let me just round out the conversation here with a look at some of our leaders and laggards in the NASDAQ 100. Apple in the upper left, that's up 1%, Alphabet down 2%. I mentioned Communication Services as one of the sectors getting a little bit of a hit today, Pinduo Duo up 1%, Netflix up 2%. Really not seeing a whole lot of rhyme or reason to a lot of these names here. Let me just circle back one more time on some of these stocks that were affected by that opening glitch. If you got a trade that was either too good to be true or too bad to be true this morning, probably going to be canceled, so anybody who sees something puzzling on their brokerage statements over the next few days or doesn't think they got the cancellation they deserve, well, take it up with your broker here.","Market had minimal movement with some sectors outperforming others. Tesla's earnings report is awaited with the options market implying a potential 10.7% move. A glitch affected some trades at the opening bell.Dow is up approximately a third of a percent, NASDAQ is down by a quarter of a percent, S&P 500 is slightly down, and the Russell 2000 is off about 14 basis points. Within sector performance, defensive sectors like real estate, Staples, and utilities are outperforming, while healthcare, communication services, and energy sectors are the biggest losers. Some notable stock movements include ITA up by one and a half percent, Arc Invest down by one and a half percent, Apple up by one percent, and Alphabet down by two percent. Tesla's year-to-date performance is up 16 percent, but over the past two years, it has experienced a significant decline, down around 50-60 percent from its highs.

89,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrDiIjj4laQ,yrDiIjj4laQ," Well, it's no secret that Tesla had a rough year facing production delays in China and of course Musk's Twitter backlash. However, that doesn't seem to deter analysts who follow the EV giant with Wall Street seeing Tesla as a buy ahead of earnings. We're here with the details as Yahoo! finances Praz Subramanian. Praz, it's hard for people not to be bullish on Tesla for some reason. Yeah, Rochelle, there's always a lot of excitement for that stock, but you know, just turning to sort of the stock performance of last year, it's just down so much that for analysts, they kind of just see upside from here. Like, you know, we've been looking, we've been tracking some of these numbers. 57% of analysts, according to Bloomberg, have a buy rating on the stock right now ahead of earnings tomorrow night. So we talk about this possible bounce back here. We've seen the shares kind of move up higher already in 2023. But beyond the rating, what's more important for analysts here are things like gross margins, right? You know, you have analysts like Tony Sakenaghi at Bernstein who were concerned about margins shrinking because of those price cuts, which happened in Q1. So we won't see that reflection in Q4, but we might hear about it in terms of guidance. Other analysts like Ken, of course, George, and Enriquez, who you guys had on yesterday, talk about how margins aren't that important because it's actually all about sort of growing their market share. And they can do that because they can cut prices and also use kind of the cheaper component prices that they've been seeing recently and also sell high margin products like FSD or Full Self Thriving that will allow them to sort of recoup some of that margin. Also, another thing to watch is, of course, volume and deliveries. Tesla has had a long term target of 50 percent CAGR growth rate for deliveries. Some analysts like Dan Ives think that's unrealistic given the fact that that would mean two million cars delivered by the end of 2023 when you have only four factories there, making 500,000 units per factory is a lot to do in one year. Ive says that Tesla and Elon Musk should come clean and cut that and make it a bit more reasonable and that will assuage investor concerns about Tesla going forward.","Analysts are optimistic about Tesla's upcoming earnings report, with 57% holding a buy rating on the stock. Important factors to watch include gross margins, volume and deliveries, and market share growth. However, some analysts express concerns about Tesla's long-term delivery targets.Tesla's long-term target for deliveries is a 50% CAGR growth rate, aiming for two million cars delivered by the end of 2023, which some analysts, like Dan Ives, find unrealistic given production capacity limitations."
90,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvkIF9Bv1sc,tvkIF9Bv1sc," Well, Union Pacific also out, but with a miss on estimates in its latest quarter, with higher expenses associated with inflation and network recovery weighing on revenue growth. The guidance for 2023 providing some light at the end of the tunnel with four-year operating ratio expecting to improve and carloads to exceed industrial production. Well, here with further insights is Union Pacific CEO Lance Fritz. Lance, good to have you on the show. So I first want to ask you about this because we were looking at the revenue growth, but then we saw what it's been offset by some of these challenges, including operation inefficiencies, elevated operating expenses. What is the plan here to really turn that around and cut some of these costs? Yeah, Rochelle, well, first, thank you for hosting me and also thank you for recognizing that we did grow last year. We beat our markets, if you will, both in the fourth quarter and in the full year, and it generated positive revenue, record revenue. But to your point, what are we going to do to recover the productivity and generate improved margins going into next year? First and foremost, it's about making sure that we have crew availability where we need it. Our hiring pipeline is fully charged and we're graduating about 150 to 200 conductors a month right now. That's the high pace that we exited the year last year. So that gives us confidence we're going to get the resources right. The current network is fluid. We exited last year and are currently performing at a car velocity and a trip plan compliance for our customers that indicates we're a pretty fluid railroad. Now, we're an outdoor network, so we're going to be impacted by things like winter storm Elliott at the tail end of December and other things that will occur throughout the year. But with our capital investment, with getting the resources right and with a very agile and better operating performance, we're confident we're going to get margin improvement in the year. And obviously there are a lot of macroeconomic issues weighing on all companies. But as you mentioned, things like winter weather more specific to your industry, but also some tightness in the labor market. Tell us about the hiring picture and now how that's impacting business. Yeah, the hiring picture was very difficult through last year and specifically in areas where we operate in a rural environment where the workforce is small and the unemployment rate are very low. That's areas like in the middle of Iowa, in the middle in Western Nebraska, out into Wyoming, and even up into Minnesota. Those areas we've largely been able to hire recently and fill our classes. But through last year, we were having a heck of a time. Now we're doing things like paying a $25,000 hiring bonus in certain spots. We're adjusting other aspects of the job. We've made sure our training produces a conductor that's fully capable and ready to work. And we've got a wonderful referral program where we ask our employees to refer people they know because great people know great people. And out of about 12,000 plus referrals last year, we generated over 1200 job offers. So that's a heck of a way for us to fill our classes as well. And certainly helps in a very tight labor market. I do want to look at another bright note in your earnings data there. The operating ratios, which is a measure of efficiency hitting 61%. Now obviously this is above the 60% threshold that a lot of railroad companies were trying to get to since the pandemic. What do you attribute that to? And I know that that's something that you also plan to see improvement in in this year, in the rest of this year. How do you plan to get there? Yeah. So Rochelle, if you go back a handful of years, we implemented an operating system that's code word PSR, precision scheduled railroading in the industry. What it fundamentally means is we redesigned our network to take work out of the network that didn't need to happen. We were switching cars in areas they didn't need to be. And we were running trains at relatively small train lengths and more of them than we needed on the network. By doing that, we fundamentally lowered our cost structure, which improved our operating ratio. At this point, a big step like that really isn't available. At this point, it's blocking and tackling using locomotives more efficiently, being fluid, making sure crew availability is high so we can use our crews efficiently and continuing to look for opportunities to keep adding cars to existing train networks, which is a very productive way to grow. And Lance, I know you've been pushing for more innovation and we know that you joined forces with the Rail Pulse Coalition. What does that mean for how you grow the business from here? What the industry means? And even in terms of perhaps crew size? Yeah, so Rochelle, Rail Pulse is a good example of some of the technology investments that we're making. That's a consortium of other car owners. They can be railroads, they can be customers. And in that consortium, we've committed to GPS up the rail cars. Rail cars are interesting in that they are on a fixed asset, the rail network. So largely, you know where they are. But when you start interchanging them or sending them into short lines, that visibility gets reduced pretty dramatically. And by putting technology on the rail car will increase that visibility. There's other investments we're making, like modeling systems to know how to build a T plan that's more robust, making customer experience better, whether it's dray drivers on one of our intermodal ramps, or customers getting an improved estimated time of arrival. And even the fundamental technology that runs the network, something we call net control, and the computer aided dispatch, all of those are seeing investments and improvements, and they help us run a more fluid and more consistent, reliable network. Now, Lance, something that a lot of analysts also honing in on is the regulatory environment with the surface transportation board, which is the economic regulator for your business. Some potential changes ahead might make it easier for customers to bring cases. What do you say to investors who are perhaps worried about how this might potentially change the operating environment? So the STB is our primary commercial regulator, and they are active. We've been spending a lot of time with STB members and their staffs, helping them see the rail economy from our perspective and in the light of the kind of regulations that they're thinking about. Generally speaking, the STB wants to get it right. They appreciate that their job is to ensure that the US freight rail network supports growth, supports customers, and is able to reinvest in itself. So bottom line, they have a vested interest in making sure their decisions are done well. And we just help them see, you know, from our perspective, how that impacts the design of some of the regulations that they're contemplating. So far, so good. They've done a very good job of balancing what they think needs to happen with doing it in a way that maintains the health of the freight rail network. Well, I do appreciate you joining me this morning. Union Pacific CEO Lance Fritz, thank you so much.","Union Pacific CEO Lance Fritz discusses Q4 2021 revenue growth, plans for crew availability and cost reduction in 2022, and technological investments in Rail Pulse Coalition. He also addresses regulatory changes from Surface Transportation Board and emphasizes the board's interest in maintaining the health of the freight rail network."
91,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-uA9KzuyUY,N-uA9KzuyUY," Microsoft earnings set to kick off tech earnings this week as layoffs sweep throughout the industry. With Microsoft among the tech giants with the largest job cuts, could this be a sign of what's to come? We're here to break it all down as Yahoo! finances Dan Howley. So Dan, a lot of expectations people are looking at here. That's right, Rochelle. This is the first earnings, obviously, since Microsoft announced that it was cutting 10,000 jobs across a number of different businesses. And so this particular earnings call is likely going to be one where CEO Satya Nadella is peppered with questions regarding the decision behind those layoffs. And then, oh, yes, they just invested $10 billion in OpenAI for that chat GPT action. So there's a lot going on at Microsoft. But just to break down some of the numbers here, according to analysts on the street, $52.9 billion this quarter. That's up from $51.7 billion in the prior quarter last year, but only by about a little more than 2%. So you can see that growth is slowing here. We're also looking at $2.30 for EPS. That's down from $2.48 in Q2 last year. Business and productivity and business processes, that's stuff like Office and things along those lines. That's going to be $16.8 billion expected, up from $15.9 billion. This is where things start to get a little cloudier, no pun intended. The intelligent cloud is going to be $21.4 billion expected. That's up from $18.3 billion. The problem is that growth is slowing significantly there. What we're looking at is a potential 16.9% year-over-year growth there. That's down from the 26% growth we had seen in the same quarter last year. And then finally, we have more personal computing. This is where you get window sales, things like that. That's going to be expected to come at $14.7 billion. That's down from $17.4 billion in the prior quarter. So obviously, this narrative of Microsoft struggling with slowing PC sales and slowing cloud sales is holding true as far as these earnings go, especially with these layoffs. And then that huge investment in OpenAI and chat GPT. This is going to be a very interesting call for Satya Nadella and company.","Microsoft's earnings call may cover layoffs, slow growth in cloud and PC sales, and their investment in OpenAI's chat GPT.Microsoft is expected to have earnings of $52.9 billion this quarter, up from $51.7 billion in the previous quarter, indicating a growth of slightly over two percent. The projected EPS (earnings per share) is $2.30, a decrease from $2.48 in the same quarter last year. The segment related to productivity and business processes, including Office, is anticipated to generate $16.8 billion, up from $15.9 billion previously. The intelligent cloud segment is expected to reach $21.4 billion, up from $18.3 billion, showing a slower growth rate of 16.9% compared to 26% the previous year. The more personal computing segment, covering items like Windows sales, is projected at $14.7 billion, down from $17.4 billion in the prior quarter. These numbers highlight a narrative of Microsoft facing challenges in PC and cloud sales growth, further emphasized by the recent layoffs and the significant $10 billion investment in OpenAI's chat GPT technology."
92,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFQQ_jnUSec,aFQQ_jnUSec," All right, now let's get to Yahoo! Finances and Nes Fereb with some of today's biggest market movers. Hey, Nes. Hey, Rachelle. And let's start with the Dow, because we have been watching on the Dow 3M down more than 5%. And this is after 3M reported its quarterly results with 3M disappointing when it comes to its profit outlook for 2023. It had an earnings miss. The company also announcing that it will be cutting about 2,500 manufacturing jobs. Why is this company important? Well, this company makes everything from building materials to materials for the medical industry, even cleaning supplies. Right now, you're watching the stock that's lower after its quarterly results. I'm going to pull up a year-to-date chart so you can see it's down about 3% year-to-date. Over on the NASDAQ 100, I'm keeping an eye out on one stock in particular here, and that's AMD, down more than 2.5% or down about 2.5%. This is after Bernstein cut AMD to market perform, cut its price target to $80 per share. AMD will be announcing its quarterly results on January 31st next week. And the chip space has really been going through an interesting time, so to speak. You have had chip companies talking about falling prices when it comes to the chips. And then taking a look at the sectors, I am keeping an eye on what's happening with the energy sector, because we are seeing this lagging today. And particularly, one stock in particular that I am also keeping an eye on is Halliburton. This is after it reported its results, with Halliburton reporting a fourth quarter profit beat, also raising its dividend by 33%. Again, today we are seeing energy stocks pull back a bit. They did very well last year. Year-to-date XLE, by the way, is up about 2.5%, Michelle.","3M's stock price declined by 5% due to an earnings miss and plans to cut 2,500 manufacturing jobs. AMD's stock price fell 2.5% after a price target cut, while Halliburton reported a Q4 profit beat, and the energy sector is lagging. Halliburton reporting a fourth-quarter profit beat and increasing its dividend by 33 percent. Energy sector stocks, including Halliburton, have pulled back slightly despite performing well the previous year."
93,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbEQHbgTx2M,pbEQHbgTx2M," General Electric reported an earnings beat this morning with robust demand for jet engines and power equipment. Still, the company gave a disappointing forecast for the year due to problems in its renewable energy business. B of A securities senior multi-industrials and industrial software analyst Andrew Obin joins us now to discuss. Good to see you, Andrew. I know that renewables missed your expectations. We're seeing investors really honing in on that with the stock price here. What do you think went wrong here? Yeah, so look, our view is that the quarter was pretty solid. GE beat the consensus on EPS and actually free cash flow. I think the debate that's taking place is really about the free cash flow forecast. GE is one of the most complex companies out there. So the big debate, the role of progress payments in terms of their free cash flow forecast. Our take is that on Apple's to Apple's basis, it's fairly straightforward. We do think free cash flow is quite a bit better than the street is forecasting. I would say the fine, the ointment is that operationally, the renewable business is probably not as robust as the street has expected. But really, free cash flow has been the key focus for investors for this name. They beat very nicely in the quarter and the outlook for 2023 is also quite a bit above street's expectations. But as I said, the debate is about progress payments. If you dig in, actually on a net basis, what you have, very strong aviation performance and solid performance and power aided by the progress payments. So let's dig into the aerospace because I know you're also looking at military there for them. What do you like in this report? Yeah, look, the big debate is that the pace of recovery in the aerospace, right? Obviously, also the supply chain has been gummed up on the commercial aerospace side. So what we're finally seeing, we're finally seeing the signs of this commercial aerospace recovery. We've been waiting for it for a couple of years, right? Investors been on and off, on and off. I think it's been a big disappointment for investors over the past couple of years. It's finally coming through. If you take a look at G-stocks performances trading in line with other aerospace names, I think the big story is the recovery in transpacific travel that's probably coming throughout 2023. It's actually the biggest pool of profits for G aviation. So we finally started to get nice visibility into 2023. And we think that explains nice stock performance here today. And in his commentary, Larry Culp saying, looking ahead, GE is positioned to drive growth, profit and cash. And our outlook reflects our confidence in our businesses. What do you see as some of the weaker aspects of business? I know we talked about what we're seeing with renewables. Is there anything else in terms of headwinds that you're keeping an eye on? No, actually, I would say, look, the issue is, as I said, we are going, the aerospace industry, you know, we got rid of a lot of people during COVID and they're finding that it's really tough to ramp up, but it's a broader industry wide issue. So I think GE is no different from the rest of the industry. Right. And obviously, as GE starts delivering engines, engines are less profitable than services. So the mix is going to turn somewhat negative. Look, as I said, renewables, the wind turbine business has been a big, big disappointment in 2022. There is a big restructuring program. It missed our expectations in the fourth quarter, offset by nice performance in their core energy business. But we think that's the source of uncertainty and the conversations we've been having with investors today. Right. It's just a view that GE really sees a straight line on restructuring from now through 2024. And I think there are some questions among the investors as to how much confidence we can have in that. But I want to say that GE is taking material amount of restructuring of this business, taking out fixed costs. IRA is a huge, huge material health care. Right. It's just changes. It's a game changer for the industry for the next decade. The question is, how soon are we going to see the impact of these positive changes in 2023? And as we talk about that spin off into healthcare, what kinds of conversations are people having? What sort of time horizon are they looking at to really see that really taking off? For renewable turn around? For the healthcare, yes. Well, healthcare, healthcare has been spun out. So healthcare is no longer part of the business. So I would say the other thing that happened today is that if you look at the outlook, right, some analysts still have healthcare as part of GE. And so what's interesting is that GE reported with healthcare, but obviously going forward, the free cash flow and earnings exclude healthcare, right? It's now going to be followed by healthcare analysts. So I think this is adding to confusion today, right? Because if you look at the consensus outlook, right, if you look at people's models, people still have healthcare numbers in their model. Actually healthcare relative to our expectations was very good. It's just the issue is that some people still have healthcare as part of ongoing operations in 23 and it's a standalone separate company, albeit GE still owns a nice chunk of it, which will be monetized over the next 12 months. That's an important distinction because a lot of people sort of jumping into the stock and wondering and not really getting too clear on that. So thank you very much. VIA Security Senior Multi-Industrials and Industrial Software Analyst, Andrew Obin. Thank you so much for joining me this morning.","General Electric reports strong Q4 earnings, led by aviation and power businesses, but issues in renewable energy sector result in a disappointing forecast. Free cash flow and 2023 outlook exceed expectations."
94,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HsWfSZxcoQ,0HsWfSZxcoQ," Amazon announcing it will release its film air in theaters. Air is about the creation of one of the most successful brands of all time. Air Jordan. Now the film is being produced by and will star Ben Affleck and Matt Damon. Other stars include Marlon Lyons of Chris Tucker, Viola Davis and Jason Bateman. Just to name a few there. A few months ago, Bloomberg reported that Amazon was planning to release 12 to 15 films in theaters and would spend a billion dollars to do so. Dave, I think this is such a smart move by Amazon. They picked the perfect film to do this with and you talk about people wanting to go back to the theaters, getting that extra exposure. I think it's a huge home run potentially here for Amazon. Oh, Affleck and Damon. How about them apples? They picked the two stars. I mean that takes us back to Good Will Hunting, one of the all-time great films and tie in Jason Bateman, one of the most underrated actors on the planet. Oh, I love him. Quite frankly and yes, this is the kind of movie coming out of the pandemic that we just don't see very often. We know the avatars of the world can't succeed but films that you can go to with your whole family, your kids and the parents want to see together. Bravo. Looks like a terrific cast and obviously the story of Nike is one related to Michael Jordan that we all relate to and we all want to hear about. But big picture, you can't help but wonder if this is what Amazon is going to do, going to have a very positive impact on the movie theater. And the film industry as a whole. We talked to Richard Gelfand, the IMAX CEO about that. He was very excited about the prospect for the films that they're going to get in theaters. Right when we see the pipeline of films looking like it's flatlining, Amazon could be that shocker that the industry needs. 12 to 15 films a year. Very excited for it. Yeah, I think it could be huge and we know we've seen some resistance from Netflix, some of the other streamers just in terms of releasing their movies, their new content in the theaters and that resistance. The resistance of the traditional model. So the fact that Amazon is taking this leap and releasing so many movies up to 15 this year, that is a huge win, I think, for the industry. And like you're saying, they're doing anything to get people back into those theaters. So something to be optimistic about. We're all wondering what they would do with this when they acquired MGM for what it was, $8.45 billion. Now we're getting a glimpse. We'll see that on Easter weekend. That way to get you back to the theaters. I was going to say that might get me. No, it'll get me there.","Amazon plans to release up to 15 films in theaters, including ""Air,"" which is produced and starred in by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon.

95,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YSpq7q3i7A,7YSpq7q3i7A," Home builders are feeling a bit better about the housing market, albeit just a bit. A sentiment ticked up in December for the first time in a year. Let's talk about where housing is headed and where it's hot in 23 with Kinloch Partners co-founder and CEO Bruce McNeil. Bruce, good to see you back here. Broadly speaking, how do you characterize what you're seeing out there in the market to start this year and is the worst behind us? So I don't think it is. I think we are going back and forth. I think the market is still finding itself. And I think builders have really adjusted to things, to increase sales, to increase traffic in their models. But I don't think the worst. I think we've got some ways to go before we start ticking back up in the housing business. We are seeing home builders stocks up pretty much across the board. KB Holmes, Toll Brothers, Lennar, DR Horton, all of them up between 5 and 11 percent. Now, granted, that's after a tough 2022, but are you optimistic for the home builders and what are you hearing from them? So I've taken a poll and talked to many of them here in the last few days and they're seeing more traffic, but traffic doesn't necessarily equate to sales. And so people are coming in, they're looking at the houses. The builders are doing a great job with concessions and some incentives, buying down the mortgage rates, the interest rates. And so we're starting to see some things turn, but high interest rates, you know, the 6.5 percent or so range for the 30 year fixed mortgage is still that rate is still keeping some people away from buying houses. Where do you see that mortgage rate heading in 2023 and where do you see it flattening out? Will that be enough to kind of thaw things out? I think if we can get to 6 percent sometime to the middle of the end of this year, that'll really help builders and also buyers of homes. You know, the people that are most affected are the entry level buyer. And I think with the incentives, maybe reduction of prices a little bit and the easing of these mortgage companies to give mortgages, I think will really, really help. You talked about concessions. It's remarkable how many of them that has really been the theme of 2022, which continues into 2023. Forty two percent of all transactions in Q4 had concessions. That's almost double from earlier in the year. What types of concessions are you seeing the most and where? The two most popular concessions are not only the reduction in price, but giving large builders credits or buyers credits. It might be refrigerators. It might be blinds. It could be closing costs, title insurance. But they're also offering incentives that I really think is the best incentive. If rates were six and a half, seven, seven and a half percent, these builders are buying down the rates to four point nine, four percent. And that really helps buyers because buyers are buying a payment. That's what they're looking for. What will their monthly payment be? And so if builders can buy down that interest rate, that's really what's going to drive people to the models. And then some inventory that hasn't sold, some standing inventory, I think will people have a good opportunity to pick up some good deals if they're looking to buy a home. Good stuff. All right. The National Association of Realtors put out the top 10 housing markets for 23. All of them, all 10 in the south, the majority in the southeast with Atlanta taking the top spot, Raleigh, North Carolina, number two. Why are those markets so hot? And is that where the majority of investment is also happening? So my firm exclusively invests in the deep south, both in Tennessee, Georgia and throughout the Carolinas. We are seeing that's where migration is going from the northeast and the midwest. We're all seeing manufacturing jobs. There's awful lot of automobile companies and manufacturing jobs going to the southeast. And quite frankly, it's the cost. When you can buy a house for 275, 325 thousand dollars, a four or five bedroom house, that's also really going to be something that drives people to that city. And the jobs are also there. So those two things are really making it a very positive for the southeast. Redfin says today a record 25 percent of users look to move in Q4. That is a record. And apparently they are moving to the south. Finally, Moody's has new numbers out today showing a record high 30 percent share of spending going towards rent in this country. Will you see that improve? Do you think in 2023? That is a massive number. You know, it's a big number. And here in Nashville, I've seen it as high as 40 and 45 percent. Of course, San Francisco, Los Angeles, that number is higher. But no, that number is not coming down. Now, rents this year will not have the robust increase that they've had last year of over 10 percent. I think we're going to see that relatively flat. And also home rental companies like ours are starting to give incentives that make it more affordable for people to get in a house. But still the high payments are still there. Are you offering rental incentives? We are in a couple of cities in the southeast. We are offering one month rent with a one year lease or we're offering a two year lease where you're not going to get an increase in the second year. We've had a very good response from that program and we see more and more companies doing that. And I think that's really helping ease things with the consumer that might not be able to buy right now, but is still looking for a high quality house for them to rent and their families to enjoy. And is the inventory story changing for the positive in the rental space this year? So inventory is still tight. However, people were building into that cycle in the downturn. So there seems to be a little bit more in the market. That's why we have a flattening out of what's going on as far as rental prices. And I don't really see that changing. There's been a lot of spec houses. Inventory has gone up for some of these builders. And because individuals haven't been able to qualify urban, a little gunshot to buy a house. Builders are selling their houses at discounts to rental operators like us throughout the country. That trend continues. Bruce McNeely, excellent observations. Good to see you. Thanks again.","Positive signs in the housing market as builders see more traffic and offer concessions, but high mortgage rates are still a concern. Strong demand in the southeast, while rental companies offer incentives to alleviate high rent costs.In Q4, 42 percent of all transactions had concessions, almost double from earlier in the year. Record 25 percent of Redfin users were looking to move in Q4. Moody's reported a record high 30 percent share of spending going towards rent in the country. Rents had a robust increase of over 10 percent in the previous year. Inventory in the rental market has increased due to spec houses and downturn-related factors."
96,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-IitVoKASo,O-IitVoKASo," Alright, just a few minutes away from the closing bell now, let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Jared Blickry to break down the market action. Hello, my friend. What are we seeing? We're seeing some outperformance by the NASDAQ yet again, and this is what's happening this year. NASDAQ up 2%, more than doubling the Dow's performance of only 0.8%. S&P 500 up 1.25%. Russell 2000, somewhere in the middle. Now, you're going to see tech. That's XLK in the upper left there. NASDAQ is up over 2%, followed by communication services and discretionary. There we go. Discretionary category is up 1.6%. Now, this is interesting because guess what? The best performing sector of the year is it's XLK. That's communication services. Yet on a trailing one-year basis, you'll see that this is the worst sector. It's down 25% down considerably more last year. So let me just show you what's going on inside the sector here. Also formally the telecommunications sector. So I'm going to turn this back to a year-to-date board and just kind of show you what's going on. And I'm looking at this today because Spotify happens to be a member of this group. Of course, that's been in the news because of the job cuts, and you can see over the last year, this is a very depressed stock, though it is up considerably off those lows on a percentage basis. You can see down almost 50% year over year. Now looking at some of the other big members here, Netflix is another one that's been in the news. That's up 21%. Alphabet up 13%, and so on. I just wanted to show you this because a lot of these sectors that have been the worst off last year have been the best off this year, and that's a theme that we've been going by. Now I want to show you Bitcoin as well because if you've been paying attention to the news, hope you have, it is broken to the upside. And let me just put this on an intraday basis for our heat map. You can see it's up 2% over the last 24 hours. Over the last year, this is the biggest rally that we've had. In fact, it's the biggest rally since these all-time highs. It's nearly 50% that we've had since we hit those all-time highs. And it doesn't look like a lot right down here, especially compared because it's at the bottom of the chart. But nevertheless, that is up nearly 50% from the lows. Let me just show you what that looks on an intraday basis. Here is a two-month look at Bitcoin. So we can see that liftoff right here. We'll have to see if this continues. But 20,000 is my line in the sand for Bitcoin. Now we want to get to the retail sector as well. Let me see if I can find this. Here we go. E-commerce has really been picking up here. And Shopify is the stock that we want to concentrate on right now. Shopify having its best day since November. And this is after Deutsche Bank raises its recommendation on the e-commerce play to buy from hold with a price target of $50. Looks like we've got 30 seconds to the bell here. They're saying they expect enterprise adoption to accelerate this year, which should let the company to once again outpace overall US e-commerce growth. And they're also saying Shopify is up 25% this year and 85% off of its fourth quarter low. So let me just show you a max chart on Shopify before we head to the bell there. Looking like a lot of those other pandemic charts. Long way to go. And just broadening this out, I want to take a look at the movie sector just for kind of a look at what's been happening on the entertainment.","NASDAQ leading the way with tech, communication, and discretionary sectors performing well. Bitcoin rallies 50% from all-time lows and Shopify shares rise after Deutsche Bank upgrades to buy with $500 price target.NASDAQ's outperformance of 2% compared to the Dow's 0.8% gain. S&P 500's rise of 1.25%. Russell 2000's performance falling in between. Tech (xlk) being up over 2%, followed by communication services and consumer discretionary categories up 1.6%. Communication Services (xlc) being the best-performing sector of the year, despite being down 25% on a trailing one-year basis. Spotify's stock down almost 50% year over year, with Netflix up 21% and Alphabet up 13%. Bitcoin's rally of nearly 50% since hitting all-time lows, with a 2% gain over the last 24 hours. Shopify's best day since November, up 25% this year and 85% off its fourth-quarter low. Enterprise adoption acceleration for Shopify's e-commerce, expected to outpace U.S. e-commerce growth.

Retail investors look back on the moment which took Wall Street by surprise. Ines Farre joins us now on this meme-aversary with more. Hey Ines. Hey Rachael. And I spoke to several retail investors that took part in the meme stock frenzy. Some of them have earned thousands of dollars from their trades. Others have not been so lucky. I talked to one retail investor and I'll show you here on a full screen that told me he thought AMC was going to be the next Tesla. He bought at around $49 a share. He sold at a loss. And he said, I was so stressed and I lost so much that my wife threatened to divorce me. So meme stock activity has waned as we have seen. We're going to show you here a chart from Vanda Research that shows net buys. And those really peaked back in 2021. You had some peaks there in 2022. Vanda Research showing these net buys, which is buying minus selling in millions of dollars. And that's for GameStop, AMC, and Bed Bath and beyond. I also spoke to Tradier. That's a brokerage firm. Their CEO Dan Razu told me that the retail investor has really changed over the last couple of years. There's been the graduation effect. They've had to navigate volatile markets. And what they're seeing is that with accounts of more than $20,000, that those investors are more apt to take on more risk than the accounts that hold less than $20,000. Rochelle? And it can be really sobering trying to time these things, which is why, you know, we see so many wins and losses in this. But given all the research that you've done, are we going to see another meme stock phenomenon develop? Not to the scale that we have seen with GameStop and AMC in the past. And that's according to everyone that I've spoken with. And that's not just because we are in a tighter monetary policy right now era, but also because portfolios are down an average of 35 percent. But I spoke to Vanda Research and retail traders will appreciate this because we often hear online their criticism of how the game is rigged and they need to register directly their shares. And this is what Vanda Research's main researcher told me. He said that these strategies that were discovered by the masses, that the game has changed now, that it's not as easy as it used to be. You can't just pump up a stock and expect to get out in time. He said that there are smart hedge funds out there, that these fund managers have gotten smarter with the game, that they can front run the retail investor, that they can play the game faster and better normally than retail investors. And oftentimes it's the retail buyers on the losing end of this. Unfortunate. Well, a big thank you there Ines Fure for us.","The two-year anniversary of GameStop's meme stock phenomenon has passed, with experts not anticipating a similar event in the near future due to tighter monetary policy and smarter hedge fund strategies. Some retail investors made gains, but the activity has waned. Retail investors may be more willing to take on risk with larger account balances. It mentions that GameStop's shares surged, driven by retail traders, causing hedge funds to cover their positions. Retail investors had mixed outcomes, with some earning thousands while others faced losses. Memes stock activity peaked in 2021 and 2022, as shown in a chart from Vanda Research. Retail investors with accounts over $20,000 were more willing to take risks. However, a future meme stock phenomenon is not expected to match the scale of GameStop and AMC due to tighter monetary policy and decreased portfolio values. Hedge funds have become more adept at playing the market, often leaving retail investors at a disadvantage."
98,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDO9JzML4yA,MDO9JzML4yA," Brighter outlook from businesses as they see a lower likelihood of the US already in or falling into a recession, as according to a new survey by the National Association of Business Economics. But markets still wary as the risk of a possible deep recession remains on the table. Here to discuss is David Bunsen, the Bunsen Group Chief Investment Officer. Good to see you David. So a lot of people wondering are the markets pricing in too much optimism at the moment? Well, it's impossible to say because without markets knowing you don't get to have a market pricing that reflects probabilities, right? You there effectively at the end of the day, someone's going to be wrong and their market positioning will end up having to adjust accordingly. And there's a lot of variance. There's a lot of shades of gray here. And that's, I think the hardest part is you don't have to have a severe recession for people to be wrong. And you don't have to have a total soft landing, no recession for people to be wrong. There's different in between spots that are frankly the most likely. A lot of people looking for some some direction here. But what about what's happening with the bond market? What is the bond market signaling? Well, the bond market to me is the best indicator. And when you look at the long end of the curve, it's the issue I'm most concerned about that has nothing to do with the current Fed, the current inflation and the covid and post covid related events. It has to do with a multi decade story of low, slow or no growth. You can't have a 10 year bond yield, a 30 year bond yield somewhere around 3 percent if you're actually pricing in robust economic growth. And I think that excessive indebtedness that we face and that puts downward pressure on productivity and growth that's been reflected in the bond market for a long time. That's to me the bigger message. Short term, it's obviously the inverted yield curve and it's short term prediction of a recession. I mean, a lot of people wondering about this recession, what kind of recession will the Fed stick the landing or not? But you say a shallow recession that turns into something deep is actually the biggest risk. What does that actually look like for the real economy? I don't think it's the biggest risk now because I don't believe that a deeper recession is the most likely. I'm more referring to longer term that kind of post financial crisis type of growth, effectively one to two percent growth, which is so far below U.S. capacity and U.S. trendline. But in the if you're referring to this year, I do believe that the idea of the Fed sticking the landing is impossible. If we get a soft landing, it will not be because the Fed stuck it. It will be because they got lucky. There are just a whole conflation of events that would be impossible to accurately predict and turn knobs for. And that's really a very possible scenario. I think back to 2002, the very mild recession we had, then President George W. Bush dealing with the aftermath of the dot com implosion. You did have obviously 9-11, the complicated things a year later, but it was largely a small recession limited to certain sectors of the economy. That's what I see happening right now. I see huge job layoffs at Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft and Google. We don't really see employment data weakening elsewhere at this time. And that is important to note because there's so much focus on the tech layoffs, not necessarily seeing that reflected across all sectors. I do want to ask you, though, obviously, we're getting into the thick of earnings season. We have Tesla coming up, Microsoft. You're going to be focusing on the revenue guidance. What are you honing in on there? Right. I think that the revenue guidance has got to be the issue that offsets some of the weakening margins. If margins are weakening, but you get greater top line growth that can perhaps hold earnings in there. But also earnings can be juiced and improved through cost cutting where revenue is the better sort of cyclical connection to potential recession. And if revenues are growing, I simply believe it and they're guiding higher on revenues, particularly now where it's more non inflationary revenue growth, where a lot of that inflation kick is sort of out of the data. I think that that probably reflects a lesser chance of recession. And so revenue guidance is going to be very important. Obviously, at the end of the day, it's always about earnings. Stock prices eventually discount to what earnings are. But earnings could very well hold in there just simply from cost cutting and improved margins. Revenues are harder to juice. So then, David, what's the investment strategy in this sort of environment with these sorts of risks? Well, I certainly believe that those who are asset allocating and have fixed income in their portfolio are going to get some better carry and some better return offset this year than last year. And so bonds, whether they're 20, 30 or 40 percent of an investor's portfolio, at least this year, are not very likely to be a drag on return, but are more than likely going to add some positive component. But for the risk part of a client portfolio, I am in any environment, whether it's 2023, 2022, or the way that we permanently believe in investing client capital, focused on dividend growth. We want companies that are growing the cash flow they pay to shareholders. We think they reflect better companies and they just give investors a better source of return along the way. We're paying close attention to that during this earnings season. A big thank you there. David Bansum there, the Bansum Group Chief Investment Officer. Thank you for your time this morning.","Businesses are optimistic about the US economy, with a lower risk of recession, but the bond market shows concern for long-term growth. The Bunsen Group CIO suggests focusing on dividend growth in investment strategy. It mentions a survey by the National Association of Business Economics showing reduced likelihood of a recession, while markets remain cautious due to the risk of a deep recession. The bond market is highlighted as an indicator of concern, indicating long-term low growth and downward pressure on productivity. The possibility of a shallow recession turning into something deeper is considered a risk, with a reference to the 2002 recession."
99,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW0NeuDcwuk,lW0NeuDcwuk," Are you still watching? Netflix coming in hot with earnings this week after Reed Hastings stepping back as CEO. This as streaming becomes more competitive, linear TV sees more cord cutters and everyone from advertisers to studios tries to reckon with changing profit models. We're joining us with more on the landscape for media and entertainment. Navin Sarma, senior director of US media and telecom at S&P Global Ratings. Good to see you Navin. I first want to ask you, starting with Netflix of course, what are some of the upsides that you see for Netflix after they really blew people out of the water with their results? Sure, they had very good results in the quarter. I think what we look at from a credit standpoint is the ability to continue to grow, to continue to generate cash flow and grow margins, which if you look at the company's guidance for 2023, they expect over three billion dollars of free cash flow, which is a huge positive. And they're also able to do all of this while also controlling costs, especially the programming costs. And so all of those things from a credit standpoint are important for Netflix and they continue to do that. And we know that there's always been that focus on subscribers. That was the benchmark when the streaming wars first started. How has that changed as you look at some of the new entrants who've come into this space as well? Sure, well, we finally are getting away from and we've always pushed for a focus on profitability and for margins and free cash flow. I think you're seeing a pivot away from the focus on subscriber growth. You're seeing a lot of companies this year, whether it's Warners, which has talked about HBO Max, as well as Paramount, as well as the other peers all talk about about getting to profitability. This year will be an important year, especially for Disney, as they are the closest to achieving profitability sometime in 2024 for Disney Plus. And so I think that focus from a credit standpoint is much better than the unsustainable, unprofitable growth that we've seen in the past as they chase subscribers. And how does Disney stack up against Netflix? Obviously, Disney has a lot more in their portfolio than Netflix does because they have the parks, they have other streams of income coming in. Yeah, sure. So I mean, from a streaming standpoint, Disney's only been doing this for a couple of years while Netflix has been doing this for about 10 years. So at least Netflix has set a path that others could try to follow. Let's see how Disney performs. They've got a lot of subscribers, but their costs have been higher. And they, as you look at the last couple of quarters, have been very unprofitable when it came to their streaming service. We'll see what the path looks like going this year. We expect to see them cut their losses at the streaming business and that they will achieve break even, cash flow break even sometime in 2024. And I mean, I know that you guys have laid out your industry themes and concerns for this space. Talk about some of the ones that are really standing out to you and who's in the best position among these media companies to really benefit from them. Sure. So interestingly enough, this year is going to be quite a challenge for the media sector. We've got secular trends that we've all been looking at for the past couple of years. You've got the pay TV ecosystem in decline as people are cutting the cord, as audience ratings are declining. You've got a studio business, which is not profitable anymore as more content is being moved from theatrical release directly to the streamers. And then on top of that, you've got unprofitability at streaming as well as the potential for a recession, which will hurt advertising and potentially hurt cord cutting as well as streaming growth. So this is going to be quite a challenging year. We look for cash flow, which is the key driver in a lot of our credit metrics to weaken this year. And we look for leverage to remain elevated. And by the end of this year, we think we'll have a good shot at figuring out who are going to be the winners and losers in the streaming wars. And to that point, I want to talk about ad spend. A lot of people were thinking, with cord cutting, linear TV dead sports, though, a very big linchpin there when it comes to linear channeling versus what we see with streaming. How do you see that playing out when it comes to ad spend? Sure. So you're right. Advertisers continue to chase sports because it's really the only place that you can get audiences, large audiences and live audiences. And so advertising has held up very well, at least thus far, for the networks that are oriented towards sports, in particular, the NFL. How that plays out over the next 10 years or so will be interesting to watch, especially as consumers get more options to watch sports on streaming services. For example, Peacock and Paramount both offer their broadcasts of the NFL on their streaming services. That weakens the pay TV bundle. And we'll see if other networks or other media companies follow suit and start offering their sports programming on their streaming services. Clearly the biggest one there is ESPN. And does Disney eventually move its sports programming onto its streaming service? And so it becomes a cannibalistic service rather than a complimentary service. Definitely one to watch, a curious one. Navin Salmadeit, Senior Director of U.S. Media and Telecom at S&P Global Ratings. Thank you so much.","Navin Sarma of S&P Global Ratings discusses the media and entertainment industry, including the streaming wars, profitability, pandemic impact on ad spend, and cord-cutting.

100,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYWQI_WRN_c,VYWQI_WRN_c," It's everyone's favorite time of year, the 2023 tax season. It kicks off today and there are some changes that consumers should be aware of. Yeah, the finances Rhonda Lee joins us now to break down the details. So Rhonda, what do we need to know? First things first, the deadline for this year instead of April 15th is April 18th due to a holiday in DC. Also California, Georgia and Alabama storm victims have until May 15th to file. So what's gone? Due to the pandemic era credits, if you relied on an income credit or the child tax credit, you are probably going to see a smaller refund because those have returned to their pre 2019 levels. The other thing is during the pandemic last year, many people were able to take up to $600 in charitable contributions without itemizing. This year you must use Schedule A to itemize and deduct any charitable contributions. Also gone this year, mortgage insurance premium deduction. So for homeowners that were deducting this, unfortunately it wasn't renewed this year. Do not confuse this with your home interest deduction separate. So that's what's gone this year. Okay, so now that we know what's gone, what about some new things that people need to keep an eye on for this taxpayer season? So good news for taxpayers who did some solar improvements. If you bought solar panels, the good news is instead of 26%, you're going to get a 30% tax credit and that's going to be retroactively applied if you bought those panels in 2022. There is no cap on credit on the credit and there are no income limitations. Previously, it only applied to your principal However, the Inflation Reduction Act removed that restriction so homeowners that put solar panels on their second or vacation homes are eligible to get this deduction. Also, if you bought an electronic vehicle in 2022, there was a change that affects those who bought the vehicles August 17th, 2022 and thereafter. The final assembly had to have happened in North America to qualify for this tax credit. Also, if you took the tax credit at the time that you purchased at the dealership, you can't do it on your tax return. I'm going to skip over the 1099K for just a second and go to the premium tax credit, which is a refundable credit for people who purchase health insurance on the health insurance marketplace. That tax credit has been extended to 2025 so people can still get that. Also, during the pandemic, we were introduced to working remotely and hybrid working. Because of that, if people were working outside the state of their employer, there was this problem with double taxation. During 2021 tax season, a lot of states offered a temporary relief so that you didn't have to do that. Most of those provisions are gone. Now, let me circle back to 1099K, which has caused problems for everybody, much confusion. So, prior, you had third-party payment networks like PayPal and Venmo. If you had more than 200 transactions for the year and they exceeded $20,000, they were required to send you a 1099K. Now, there was a change that was made due to the American Rescue Plan Act that lowered that threshold to $600 for a single transaction. Confused many taxpayers, due to the major confusion, the IRS has delayed implementation of the 1099K. If you have questions regarding 1099K and any other tax stuff, always consult a tax professional. And Rhonda, just quickly, for people who are wondering if their refund might look a little bit smaller this year, what should they be aware of? Like I said, those pandemic-era tax credits are gone. So, if you don't have your stimulus payments and all that other stuff, and the amount has, it looks like, to return back So, just for an example, last year, people, if they had earned income credit, could get, if they had no children, they could get up to $1,500 in the credit. This year, it's back to 2019, which is $500. For the child tax credit, the CTC, last year, you could get up to $3,600 per dependent. This year, $2,000. For the Child Independent Care Act, you could get up to $8,000 for one dependent. This year, $2,100. So, the difference is drastic in what they'll be seeing. So, particularly if the child tax credit, earned income credit, and the Child Independent Care credit, which is where most people receive their refund, it's going to hurt them there. However, if they have, if they can get refunds other places, they may see an increase. So, for people who, let's say, they had an electronic vehicle or something like that, they might be able to get something, but a lot is going to depend on where most of your refund is coming from. Well, it certainly helps so that people can brace themselves if they do see a smaller refund. They'll at least know why. Yahoo Finance's Rhonda Lee. Thanks so much.","2023 tax season begins with new changes such as a deadline extension, reductions in pandemic tax credits, and new tax credits for solar panels and North American-made EVs. Taxpayers may also receive 1099K forms for transactions exceeding $600.Pandemic-related tax credits have returned to pre-2019 levels, potentially resulting in smaller refunds. Charitable contributions now require itemizing on Schedule A, and the mortgage insurance premium deduction is no longer available. New provisions include a higher tax credit for solar panel purchases and expanded eligibility for electronic vehicle tax credits. The premium tax credit for health insurance remains available until 2025. Double taxation relief for remote work across states during the pandemic is mostly removed. Changes to the 1099-K reporting threshold and delays in its implementation have caused confusion. Refunds for earned income credit, child tax credit, and child independent care credit may be smaller compared to the previous year."
101,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe1eW4Fq4Ow,qe1eW4Fq4Ow," All right. Well, among the growing list of tech companies trimming its workforce is Salesforce, the cloud-based software giant hit with a downgrade from Cohen as elevated levels of disruption, risk and medium term overhangs on shares raises concerns. We're here to discuss is Cohen Managing Director Derek Wood. Derek, good to see you here. So obviously, let's talk about this activist investor move. You have Elliott Management joining starboard value as activists with this multi-billion dollar stake. What does this do? Do you think in terms of what this perhaps signifies? What sort of context should we be putting this in? Yeah, well, I think that there has been a push for the by a lot of investors to get expenses down and get margins up. We don't have a whole lot of information at this point. I suspect that the company's been in talk with management for the last couple of months. Management has definitely put out more of a structured outline of what they're going to do in terms of increasing margins. They obviously just recently announced a 10% headcount cut and they're going to be doing some rationally of real estate. So I think we're going to want to see kind of a little bit more prescriptive outline over the next few years and in partnership with Elliott and we'll see what Elliott wants to push. I mean, they could do things like trying to do more of a special dividend or an accelerated buyback. I mean, we already have a new buyback that has come into place, $10 billion buyback from Salesforce. They've bought back almost $2 billion in the last quarter. So I think Salesforce is already doing a lot of things to appease, but we'll see what else can come about. So do you think this is going to be much of a catalyst then for Salesforce to sort of push forward more quickly? It could be. I mean, so Elliott's been involved in lots of software investments over the past decade plus. If we were out 10 years ago, they were getting involved with smaller companies and trying to kind of push for sales by, you know, strategic or other private equity. I mean, this is obviously, this is $150 billion market cap. You're not going to be pushing for a sale of this company. So then we look at what has Elliott done in past deals. One of the most recent ones was in was with SAP when they got involved in 2019. And there wasn't a ton of change that actually happened. There was, SAP had already gone down a path of laying out how they're going to increase operating margins by 500 basis points over five years. And that was more of a passive involvement by Elliott. I think one thing that did come about was a one time buyback, but it was only a billion and a half in euros. And so was it too significant? And there wasn't much change. One thing that did happen, there was a bit of C level turnover. You did see Bill McDermott, who was CEO of SAP, leave six months later. And so there was a little bit of pressure at the executive level. So that's that's the last big software transaction they've been involved with. And and we could see similar things with Salesforce. And we know that this comes on the heels of executive departures already from Brett Taylor, Stuart Butterfield. How concerned are you about the direction of Salesforce short term versus say longer term? That's why we downgraded last week. I mean, there's a lot of disruption happening. There's a lot of firsts, as we called it. We're looking for 13% growth in Q4. That will be the lowest growth ever. The last trough of growth during the 08-09 financial crisis was 19%. So we've broken that and we're forecasting 10% growth next year. The level of concurrent executive departures, we've never seen this many, as you mentioned, a 10% headcount cut, we've never seen that kind of restructuring. And our argument is that sales efficiencies seem like they need to be tended to quite a bit. And there may be a lot of work to get those efficiencies in line with where they need to need to go. And so this 10% headcount cut may not be the first, there may be more restructuring that we're going to have to see more iterations getting the cost structure in place, especially since it seems like they're not doing the level of M&A they used to do over time. So still a lot of unknowns, a lot of restructuring charges that they're going to take. And hopefully they're going to be in a lot more efficient place once they get through this, but it could take some time. And Benioff did note in that layoff note, talking about customers taking a more measured approach to their purchasing decisions. Does this mean that sort of the best of the days are over? Can they expect the sort of hyper growth that they were seeing before? I mean, at this stage, at this size of the company, I mean, it's obviously hard to, I think, get back to 20% organic growth. But they're not alone in the macro right now. I mean, front office software had a little bit of a pull forward effect of investment during COVID. Now we're seeing a little bit of a hangover from that. With companies slowing, the macro slowing, there's just a lot more measured buying and they're fairly penetrated in their market. And so that's why, I mean, companies that have pretty high penetration, that are seat based licensing models and are facing a slower headcount growth environment are going to see tougher buying conditions, more scrutiny on budgets. And there's a lot of other companies seeing the same thing. I think there's questions as to how do we navigate through this year? What's it going to look like? But it sounds like people are still concerned that the macro could get worse, that we could go into a recession. So I think buying behavior is going to remain cautious. And that's why we're expecting roughly 10% growth this year. And certainly, as you mentioned, the sales force not alone in dealing with these macroeconomic issues, still plaguing them. A big thank you there to Derek Wood, Co-Owned Managing Director. Thank you for joining me this morning.",Salesforce has been downgraded by Cohen and is facing pressure from activist investors Elliott Management and Starboard Value.

102,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzUsxi6dXz0,yzUsxi6dXz0," All right. Well, Elon Musk due back on the stand today as he has tried in federal court for a class action case brought by investors who say they lost money because of his tweets proposing to take Tesla private. Now here with the latest is Yahoo! finances Alexis Keenan. Hey Alexis. Hi, Rachelle. Yes, we're expecting Musk to get up on the stand again in California federal court for a second day of testimony. In about 10 minutes from now, he started his testimony on Friday and he began his questioning from the attorney that's representing Tesla's shareholders who claim that Musk illegally manipulated Tesla's stock price in 2018 when he tweeted that now infamous tweet that said that he had funding secured to take the company private at $420 per share. Musk for his part is expected to testify that he did have a handshake deal from Saudi Arabia's public investment fund to do just that. Now so far Musk's testimony has said that his tweets were and are truthful and that he sees Twitter as a vehicle that is the most democratic way to get equal information to shareholders, though he did admit on the stand that he ignored the suggestion of Tesla investors as well as some of its board members back at that time in 2018 to take a break from Twitter. He also said that it's really difficult to correlate tweets with Tesla's stock price, he said, because the stock can really act counterintuitively to his point. He said he gave this example of having tweeted before that Tesla stock is overpriced and he said, and lo and behold, the stock price went up. So what's at stake here for both Musk as well as some board members, former and present that are named in this lawsuit, is about $12.6 billion in a market cap swing that happened from the day of the tweet, August 7th of 2018 to August 17th. Now these investors, they haven't specified that number as damages in their lawsuit. They haven't given an exact number of their losses, but that's the kind of money that we're talking about here that perhaps if Musk is held liable that he and the board could be held accountable for. Now to win though the shareholders, they must prove that the trading losses that they sustained are tied exactly to a false statement by Musk. And what's tricky here is that the judge in this case has already ruled and instructed the jurors to interpret the funding secured statement as a false statement. So that's Musk's biggest hurdle here, but we will bring you the latest later today as we continue to listen in on this trial and Musk's testimony. So Alexis, how complicated is this? For example, he was saying that when he said funding secured, that it was a short tweet, you know, it didn't include all the details. So he wasn't really misleading. How complicated is it to untangle that when you're trying to interpret what someone meant in a tweet? It's complicated and Musk has already been asked by the shareholders attorney about just this. The attorney asked him, you understand though that whether you're making a statement in SEC filing or on Twitter that you are accountable for that tweet to be accurate and truthful. And he said yes, but he did kind of put an asterisk there on his testimony to say, but look, everybody who's reading Twitter understands that the tweets have a character limitation. And he said, quote, just because I tweet something does not mean people believe it or will act accordingly. So hedging a bit there and trying to put his best foot forward as to how people interpret Twitter. But at the end of the day, yes, these tweets, whether tweets or an SEC filing, they do have to be accurate. So we'll see how the jurors interpret these words from Musk. Indeed, tweets are receipts these days. Alexis Keenan, thank you so much for getting us up to speed.",Elon Musk is testifying in a $12.6 billion class action case brought by investors who claim they lost money due to his tweets proposing to take Tesla private.

We're 17 minutes into trade. Let's get on over to Yahoo Finance's Jared Blickery over at the Wi-Fi Interactive. Hey, Jared. Hey there. Nice to see some green, and I am noticing something that is different this year than it was the year before. That is the NASDAQ is tending to lead more than the Dow, and you can see the Dow is up only about 13 basis points, the NASDAQ up about 0.8% of a percent. Lots of green around the world. Let's take a look inside one of the major indices here. This is the Dow. This is going to be over the last year. What I want people to notice is the Dow currently is in the upper end of its trading range. Now you take a look at the NASDAQ, and it's kind of the opposite. It's all the way down here, but it has been picking up steam since the beginning of the year and leading on a relative basis. So we'll have to see if that continues here. We're going to check out the sector action and part for the course with the NASDAQ 100, the tech-heavy index getting most of the gains. Guess what? Techs, XLK in the number one spot, followed by communication services, energy, and consumer discretionary. Three out of these four sectors, not energy, are the leading sectors inside the NASDAQ. Here we see Apple up over 1%, Tesla up 2%, and just taking a look at some of our leaders here, do we see some money going into the fringe markets? Well, number one up there is MJ, only up about 2.5%, but Weedstocks definitely qualify. Byto, that is a Bitcoin ETF. We're going to take a look at that in a second. Sox, that's chip stocks, XRT, retail, ARK, gambling. So we are seeing some money spread around some of the fringier sectors. Now I want to take a look at crypto. Nothing fringier than that, right? And I say that in a loving way. Bitcoin down about four-tenths over the last 24 hours, but I want to show you what's been happening over the last year. Here we see Bitcoin has been mired in the lower end of its trading range, but it has managed its nice breakout since the beginning of January. That breakout is good for, what is that, 37%, pretty nice there. I want to show you, that is the biggest jump up we have seen since about a year ago. Now let me put a 10-year chart just so we can get some of the historical support and resistance. 20,000, a huge level. The fact that we are holding above 20,000, that is a big first step. But we have all this price memory beginning at 30,000, and there's a big tendency of people who are holding something that's been losing money for a while to, what, get out at break even. As soon as it gets in the green for one penny, a lot of people tend to sell. That's why Anchor VWAP works. That's why we talk about price memory. So long way to go, but end of the story, this is a good start.","Major indices are up early in the day, with the NASDAQ leading. Tech and communication services sectors are performing well, and there is increased activity in fringe markets such as crypto and weed stocks.The NASDAQ is leading with about an 0.8% gain, while the Dow is up only by approximately 0.13%. Within the NASDAQ 100, the tech-heavy index, the top-performing sectors are Tech (XLK), Communication Services, and Consumer Discretionary. Apple is up over 1%, and Tesla is up 2%. In the crypto space, Bitcoin has experienced a recent breakout, rising about 37% since January. It is currently holding above the significant level of $20,000, which is a positive step."
104,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95KwV32UKt0,95KwV32UKt0," So taking a look at the major averages here out of the gate. Sorry, trying to calibrate some charts over here for our viewers. There we go. All right, Dow Jones Industrial Average, you're seeing that higher actually fractionally by about 1 10th of a percent this morning. The NASDAQ composite, you're seeing that up by about 2 10th of a percent, S&P 500 also holding onto some slight gains. And this comes after in the futures, as we had mentioned, things were pointing a little negative flat just barely to the downside early, early this morning. But as of right now, opening cross, looking good for the major averages here in the US. Let's take a look at some sectors as well. And I'll come back to this apparel screen in a hot second here. But taking a look at the sector performance that we've been tracking here on the day, there we go. 11 S&P 500 sectors, folks. And you've got it relatively mixed, about as split as it gets for an 11 S&P 500 sector base. But anyway, taking a look at energy that's leading the charge here on the day that's up by about 7 10th of a percent. And then bringing up the caboose. You've got utilities. It's down by about half a percent as of right now. So relatively split overall, though, just flat barely to the upside for the S&P 500. Let's take a brief look at the NASDAQ composite tech heavy average. And we'll put this on an equal weight for you just to take a quick look. And also relatively split for the NASDAQ 100 names. And then just lastly here, you had some interesting calls come out on retail names earlier this morning. Both Tapestry, Skechers going to be in focus. Tapestry, that got a downgrade from Barclays to equal weight from Overweight. And then Skechers as well. That actually was upgraded to outperform from Market Perform. So we'll keep a close eye on those shares. But here's a broad look at retail on the day. You know, it's really interesting as you were looking at that sector full screen, it looked like some of the interest rate sensitive defensive groups were doing worse, real estate and utilities. Indeed, we see the 10 year yield perking up a little bit today. I'm seeing it around 3.54%. But it's not hurting technology as it has been recently, right? So that's quite interesting as well. It's hurting more of the traditional interest rate sensitive groups and not the newer interest rate sensitive groups. So that's something to continue to watch here.","US markets opened slightly positive with Dow Jones, NASDAQ, and S&P 500 increasing by fractional percentages. Energy was the best performing sector while utilities saw a decline. Tapestry was downgraded, while Skechers was upgraded in the retail sector. The 10-year yield rose slightly, but technology stocks were not affected as much as traditional interest rate-sensitive industries.The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased fractionally by about 1/10 of a percent, the NASDAQ composite rose by about 2/10 of a percent, and the S&P 500 had slight gains. Energy sector was up by about 7/10 of a percent, while utilities were down by about half a percent. The 10-year yield was around 3.54%. Tapestry received a downgrade from Barclays to equal weight from Overweight, and Skechers was upgraded to outperform from Market Perform."

He joins us now to discuss the most surprising findings from the trip. Good to have you back, Rick. So what stood out to you? And those are some of my photographs I took just with my iPhone while I was there. Amazing contrast in Cuba. Some of the buildings are falling apart and yet there's great art, there's great culture there, good food if you can go to restaurants that get imported products. You know, a couple of things really surprised me on this trip, Richelle. I've got a full story up on the website, but just to tick off a couple of those things. First, there actually is what you might call a burgeoning private sector in Cuba. I did not realize this, but the communist government there has changed the rules in recent years. So you are allowed to start a private business now. Tax rates are pretty high, about 50-50% all in, but you are allowed to keep profits once you pay your taxes and abide by other rules. There are some limits on this. You can only own one business, it can't employ more than 100 people. But on this trip, I was able to talk to some business owners and they're pretty ambitious. And one of the things they tell you over and over is that the U.S. sanctions on Cuba, which have been in place for a long time and actually got tougher under the Trump administration, really make it difficult just to operate a business in any normal sense of the word. There are financial restrictions that make it very hard to import anything from raw materials to finished products. People told me, for example, sometimes you can't even get paper to make paper bags that people can use at gift shops. A clothing business owner told me the best way to get plain t-shirts in Cuba so local designers can print them up is to actually buy them in bulk in the United States or some other foreign country and then put them in your luggage and bring them on the airplane on the trip back to Cuba. I mean, just amazing hurdles that these people have to go over. But there is a private sector forming there and another recurring theme from government officials, private sector officials, people who work for state-owned businesses, they want to buy more American products. Everything from food to fuel to medical supplies, sanctions make that very difficult and I'm not sure that is likely to change anytime soon. But if we can ever get over the sanctions on Cuba, they seem to be a ready customer for a lot of American products. So then, I mean, as we saw the reset with Barack Obama, then we saw Trump imposing the sanctions again. In terms of President Biden, then any prospect of reopening the relationship between the United States and Cuba? It's a really interesting question because Biden has actually said more than once that he wants to reverse the Trump policy on Cuba and basically go back to what what Obama did. Sometimes I mix them up and I call them O'Biden. I'm sorry about that. But he wants to go back more or less to what Obama did, which is open up and set the stage for more trade between the United States and Cuba. But he has actually done very little since he became president and the politics on this are very thorny. There are some very passionate, mostly Cuban Americans in Florida who are staunchly opposed to any reopening with Cuba. And that's because they are their families lost a lot when Fidel Castro took over the government in 1959. And they say no reopening to Cuba until that communist government changes its ways. On the other hand, a lot of people would like to do business, people in the United States would like to be able to sell more products to Cuba, but there's just not a real strong constituency pushing for that. So the Biden White House may want to open up with Cuba, but I think they just don't feel like there's anything to gain from doing that. And they might get punished by some voters in Florida if they were to open up. So could be more to come on this in Biden's second year when he might have a little more freedom to do stuff that we will see in coming months. Certainly doesn't want to risk that voter backlash. Indeed, Rick Newman there. Thanks so much.","Rick Newman reports on his trip to Cuba and the growing private sector there, but notes that US sanctions make it difficult to trade normally. He also discusses the political challenges that President Biden faces in reopening relations with Cuba."
106,https://youtu.be/_H97_Q1CkjE,_H97_Q1CkjE," Hi Mr. Buffett, my name is Mallory Marshall. I am 11 years old and I am from Kearney, Nebraska. I have two questions. First, my dad would like to know if you have any grandsons my age. She wants to know if you have any grandsons her age. How many shares of stock do you have? Also, what investment advice do you have for young people of my generation? I have a grandson fairly close to your age and he probably would go for a younger woman anyway. I will mention him to you. If you are interested in financial matters, A, you have to have something to work with. I was fortunate in that respect because my dad paid for my education. If he hadn't, I probably wouldn't have become educated if I had to pay for myself. So I was able to save $10,000 by the time I was 21. That was a huge, huge head start. If I hadn't been able to do that and my first child came along when I was 22, it is much easier to save it in those teenage years if you are lucky enough to be in a family where you don't have, where your parents are taking care of your financial obligations. Every dollar then is worth making $10 or $20 later on. If you are interested in financial matters, getting a stake early is very useful and getting knowledge early is very useful. I would say you are well on the way if at 11 you are even interested in coming to a meeting like this. If that interest is maintained, I would read financial publications. I would read whatever was of interest to me. I would be curious about how the businesses around the town of Kearney operated. I would, to the extent that you can get people to talk to you, and people usually like to talk, you know, learn about who's got good businesses in Kearney and why they are good businesses and learn about the businesses that went out of business and why they went out of business and just keep accumulating knowledge. That's one of the beauties of the business that Charlie and I are in is that everything is cumulative. The stuff I learned when I was 20 is useful today. Not necessarily the same way and not necessarily every day, but it's useful. So you're building a database in your mind that is going to pay off over time, but you have to have a little money to work with. So there's nothing like getting a few dollars ahead, stay away from credit cards, and you're going to have a lot of fun if your mind goes along that track as you get older. Charlie? Well, I'm glad to see somebody that has so early shown an interest in getting ahead. There's nothing wrong with getting ahead. And actually, she may have the best idea about getting ahead by learning the name of my grandson. Well, there I can give the young lady some advice. Before your feelings totally take over, you should look carefully at both parents and all four grandparents. Right, Charlie, and let us know how it works out.",Warren Buffett advises young people to start saving money and accumulating knowledge. He also shares a joke about having a grandson close to a girl's age and advises her to be careful before getting too invested in a relationship.
107,https://youtu.be/_xoLSEKkbzY,_xoLSEKkbzY," Hello Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munker. My name is David Klein-Rodick from Lincolnshire, Illinois. Thank you for letting me ask the first question. I wanted to say I am sorry for the loss of your friend Mrs. Graham last year. My question is, you have said that your favorite time to own a stock is forever, yet you sold McDonald's and Disney after not owning them for long. How do you decide when to hold forever and when to sell? And also, are you and Mr. Munker wearing Fruit of the Looms? Charlie? I think I better answer the question. I can answer unequivocally, I am wearing Fruit of the Loom. I'm not sure whether Charlie wears underwear, do you? I haven't bought any new underwear in a long time and therefore I am inappropriately attired. He's waiting for a discount, don't let him kid you. Well, the answer is a very good question about selling. I mean, it's not our natural inclination to sell. And on the other hand, and we have held the Washington Post stock since 1973. I've never sold a share of Berkshire, having bought the first shares in 1962. And we've held Coke stock since 1988, we've held Gillette stock since 1989, held American Express stock since 1991. We had actually previously been on American Express in the 60s in Disney. So there are companies we're familiar with. We generally sell, we would sell if we needed money for something else, but that has not been the problem the last 10 or 15 years. 40 years ago my sales were all because I found something that I liked even better. I hated to sell what I sold, but I also didn't want to borrow money. So I would reluctantly sell something that I thought was terribly cheap to buy something that was even cheaper. Those were the times when I had more ideas than money. Now I've got more money than ideas, and that's a different equation. So now we sell really when we think that we've, when we're re-evaluating the economic characteristics of the business. In other words, if you take them, don't want to name names, but take a stock we've sold of some sort, we've probably had one view of the long-term competitive advantage of the company at the time we bought it, and we may have modified that. That doesn't mean we think that the company is going into some disastrous period or anything remotely like that. We think McDonald's has a fine future, we think Disney has a fine future, and there are others. But we probably don't think that their competitive advantage is as strong as we might have thought, as we thought it was when we initially made the decision. That may mean that we were wrong when we made the decision originally. It may mean that we're wrong now, and that their strengths are every bit of what they were before. But for one reason or another, we think that the strengths may have been eroded to some degree. A classic case on that would be the newspaper industry generally, for example. I mean, in 1970, Charlie and I were looking at the newspaper business. We felt it was about as impregnable a franchise as could be found. We still think it's quite a business, but we do not think the franchise in 2002 is the same as it was in 1970. We do not think the franchise of a network television station in 2002 is the same as it was in 1965. And those beliefs change quite gradually, and who knows whether they're right even. But that is the reason in general that we sell now. If we got into some terribly cheap market, we might sell some things that we thought were cheap to buy something even cheaper after we'd bought lots and lots of equities. But that's not the occasion right now. Charlie? Nothing to add. He's been practicing for weeks. Okay.","Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger would sell a stock if they needed money or if they re-evaluate the long-term competitive advantage of the company. They also joked about their choice of underwear during a recent event. In recent years, his selling decisions have been based on reevaluating the economic characteristics of businesses and considering whether their competitive advantages have eroded."
108,https://youtu.be/-g0QhHc7F0E,-g0QhHc7F0E," Crypto was another question that I got a lot of. I'll ask this one from Carl Mosquitello, who says, crypto is a $2 trillion asset class. Are you willing to admit you missed something? Well, I certainly didn't invest in crypto. I'm proud of the fact I've avoided it. It's like, you know, some venereal disease or something. I just regard it as beneath contempt. Some people think it's modernity and they welcome a currency that's so useful in extortions and kidnappings and so on and so on, tax evasion. And of course the envy, everybody has to create his own new currency. And I think that's crazy too. So I'm not having any, I wish it had been banned immediately. And I admire the Chinese for banning it. I think they were right and we've been wrong to allow it. Perhaps this is the appropriate followup. Then this comes from Micah Mysick who asks, Mr. Munger, you've been warning of the evils of cryptocurrency in the past. How do you feel about the Federal Reserve preparing to launch a central bank digital currency? Do you think that this will be beneficial or harmful to the strength and resilience of our markets? No, no, the Federal Reserve could have a currency if they want one, but that would be just a, we've got a digital currency already, it's called a bank account. The banks are all integrated with the Federal Reserve system. We already have a digital currency.",Charlie Munger is critical of crypto and wishes it was banned immediately. He also thinks a central bank digital currency is unnecessary since we already have a digital currency through bank accounts integrated with the Federal Reserve system.
109,https://youtu.be/-q7W0hNSGMQ,-q7W0hNSGMQ," And then the crisis spread to one of Wall Street's biggest and most respected firms. Not since the Great Depression has the federal government stepped in to help a failing financial institution in this country the way they did over this past weekend. Panic Selling has brought Bear Stearns, an investment bank, to its knees. JPMorgan Chase buys the firm, but only after the government loans $30 billion to buy up Bear's most toxic assets. The Federal Reserve has moved quickly to bring order to the financial markets. Secretary Paulson is supportive of that action. The man at the center of it all, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, knows he has dodged a bullet. After Bear Stearns, what did you think was going to happen? Did you think it was over? Oh, no. What hit us big time, all of us, was, wow, if an investment bank gets hit by a run in the middle of a panic, we don't have the authorities in the United States government to save them unless there's a buyer. Within hours of the rescue of Bear Stearns, all eyes turn to the next giant that might fall, Lehman Brothers. Lehman's books are loaded with troubled subprime mortgages. I had 60 calls with Dick Fould from the time Bear Stearns went down until Lehman failed. I said, what you should be doing is you should be raising capital and you should be looking for a cornerstone strategic investor or working to sell the business. And what did he tell you? Well, he's an optimist. So he basically said, I've got plenty of capital. We don't have a significant risk. But Lehman's falling stock price is telling a different story. Financials took a big beating Lehman down almost 20 percent. In just a few months, Lehman has lost nearly half its value. Fould is enraged and blames those betting against his company, the short sellers. I am soft. I'm lovable. But what I really want to do is I want to reach in, rip out their heart and eat it before they die. He would come up with these wacky ideas and this idea spinco where he was going to put his bad assets in a pool and spin them off. And he would say, well, I want the government to guarantee it or the government to put in capital. And we explained ad nauseam that the government couldn't do that.","This statement summarizes the 2008 financial crisis, the government's intervention to save failing financial institutions, Lehman Brothers' collapse due to subprime mortgage holdings, and the CEO's attribution of the company's decline to short sellers.Bear Stearns faced panic selling, was acquired by JP Morgan Chase with a $30 billion government loan, Lehman Brothers lost almost 20% of its stock value in a few months and nearly half its value overall, and Lehman's CEO, Dick Fuld, had around 60 calls related to the crisis."
110,https://youtu.be/-x8y6wRCV94,-x8y6wRCV94," Hi, I'm Brady Ritchie from St. Louis, Missouri, shareholder since 1996. Terrific. Warren, you and Charlie have been critical of business schools in the past and what they teach. With respect to value investing and super investors of Graham and Doddsville, you featured the returns of many great investors with different backgrounds, work and education. With the lesson being following the philosophy is the key. To be successful today, does it still just fall back to chapter 8 of the Intelligent Investor and what do you think of programs and designations such as CFA, CFP, etc., which purport high standards yet rooted heavily into academia? And I'd like to challenge you to a round of bridge tomorrow. What was the last part? Well, what do we think about? Yeah, business schools and all that. I didn't catch the last one. They're better. Oh, he's challenging me to a round of bridge. I went to three business schools and at each I found a teacher or two. I went to one specifically to get a given teacher, but each one of them I found a teacher or two that everybody got a lot out of. So we're not anti-business school here at all. We do think that the priesthood, say 30 years ago for example, or 40 years ago in terms of efficient market theory, they strayed pretty far in our view from the reality of investing and I would rather have a person, if I could hire somebody among the top five graduates of number one, two, or three of the business schools and my choice was somebody that had, was bright, but had chapter eight of the Intelligent Investor, absolutely it just was natural to them. They had it in their bones basically. I take the person from chapter eight. This is not, what we do is not a complicated business. business, but it does not require a super high Q or anything of the sort. And there are a few fundamentals that are incredibly important and you do have to understand accounting and it helps to get out and talk to consumers and start thinking like a consumer in many ways in certain industries, all of that. It just doesn't require advanced learning. And I certainly, you know, I didn't want to go to college so I don't know whether I would have done better or worse if I'd just quit after high school. You know, and read the books I read and all of that. I think that if you run into a few great teachers and they really change the way you see the world to some degree, you know, you're lucky and you can find them in academia and you can find them in ordinary life. And I've been extraordinarily lucky in having great teachers, including Charlie. I mean, Charlie's been a wonderful teacher. And any place you can find somebody that gives you insights into things you didn't understand before, maybe makes you a better person than you would have been before, you know, that's very lucky and you want to make the most of it. If you can find it in academia, make the most of it. And if you can find it in the rest of your life, make the most of it. Charlie? Charlie? Well, when you found Ben Graham, he was unconventional and he was very smart. And of course, that was very attractive to you. And then when you found out it worked and you could make a lot of money by sitting on your ass, of course, you were an instant convert. And so... It still appeals to me, actually. But the world changed. Before he died, Ben Graham recognized that the exact way he sought undervalued companies wouldn't necessarily work for all times under all conditions. And that's certainly the way it worked for us. We gradually morphed into trying to buy the better companies when they were underpriced instead of the lousy companies when they were underpriced. And of course, that worked pretty well for us. And Ben Graham, he outlived the game that he played personally most of the time. He lived to see most of it fade away. I mean, just to find some company that's selling for one-third of its working capital and figure out it could easily be liquidated and distribute $3 for every dollar of market price. Lots of luck if you can find those in the present markets. And if you can find them, they're so small that Berkshire wouldn't find them of any use anyway. So we've had to learn a different game. And that's a lesson for all the young people in the room. If you're going to live a long time, you have to keep learning. What you formerly knew is never enough. So if you don't learn to constantly revise your earlier conclusions and get better ones, why, you are... I always use the same metaphor. You're like a one-legged man in an ass-kicking contest. Yeah. If anybody has suggestions for another metaphor, send them to me. Yeah. Graham, incidentally, one point, important point, Graham was not scalable. I mean, you could not do with really big money. And when I worked for Graham Newman Corp, here he was the dean of all analysts, and you know, he was an intellect above all others around that time. But the investment fund was $6 million, and the partnership that worked in tandem with the investment company also had about $6 million in it. So we had $12 million we were working with. Now you're going to make adjustments for inflation and everything, but it was just a tiny amount. It wasn't really scalable. And the truth is, Graham didn't care because he really wasn't interested in making a lot of money for himself. So he had no reason to want to find something that could go on and on and become larger and larger. And so the utility of chapter 8 in terms of looking at stocks as a business is of enormous value. The utility of chapter 20 about a margin of safety is of enormous value. But that's not complicated stuff. I finally figured out why the teachers of corporate finance often teach a lot of stuff that's wrong. When I had some eye troubles very early in life, I consulted a very famous eye doctor. And I realized that his place of business was doing a totally obsolete cataract operation. They were still cutting with a knife after better procedures had been done. And I said, why are you in a great medical school performing absolute obsolete operations? He said, Charlie, it's such a wonderful operation to teach. Well, that's what happens in corporate finance. They get these formulas and it's a fine teaching experience. You give them a formula, you present the problem, they use the formula. It's you get a real feeling of worthwhile activity. There's only one trouble, it's all balderdash. Yeah, whenever you hear a theory described as elegant, watch out.",Buffett and Munger believe that business schools are not necessary for success in investing. They discussed the evolution of their investment strategies and the importance of constantly revising earlier conclusions and learning new things. They also pointed out flaws in some formulas taught in corporate finance.
111,https://youtu.be/1-OJX1rwnl8,1-OJX1rwnl8," If you've ever ordered something at Starbucks, you've probably loaded one of these. Starbucks, between October and December, has set something like $3 billion of value as loaded onto these cards. I mean, that's a lot of money. So much money, in fact, that if Starbucks was a bank, it would rank as the 385th biggest in the country. And it's money that Starbucks gets to use upfront as revenue before a single product is even purchased. Eventually, it is a liability if someone chooses to use it. And you will find that in lots of gift card programs, there are plenty of people who never use it. So how important is Starbucks' mobile app and gift cards to its bottom line? And what role does technology play in its continued evolution? This is The Economics of Starbucks. In 1971, the first Starbucks, a small, unassuming cafe, opened in Seattle's downtown. Fast forward 50 years, and that store is still in operation. But Starbucks is a global coffee giant. Only McDonald's is bigger than Starbucks when it comes to market caps. So they are really a powerhouse when it comes to really the whole restaurant industry. In its early years of operation, Starbucks expanded slowly and only within Seattle. It wasn't until 1987, when the original owners sold the company to its then marketing director, Howard Schultz, that the Starbucks that we know today took root. Schultz began expanding Starbucks outside of the city and introduced Americans to what was then a little-known Italian drink, the espresso. They were really founded on this coffee house culture that they make each beverage by hand according to order. As Starbucks has grown, that has gotten more complicated. Today, Starbucks says they make more than 170,000 different varieties of drinks. These beverages can be very complex. They can take a while. They can take many different ingredients. And so it's good for Starbucks in that these tend to be higher-priced beverages. But for workers, the baristas, it can be very complicated. The company's early investment in espresso has transformed to many different signature drinks from the creation of the Frappuccino to the launch of the pumpkin spice latte. Pumpkin spice latte. High five it. They really didn't know that it would take off like it did, but clearly it has formed quite a phenomenon all around the world, really. We introduced pumpkin to spice. Us here, Starbucks. One additional thing in Starbucks' evolution is cold beverages have become much more important to the company, whether it's just an iced coffee or a nitro iced coffee or all these cold foam and cold brewed. Increasingly, this is so important to their revenue. The company has gone through periods where Frappuccino sales have softened, but they've come up with more cold drinks to keep people interested and keep people ordering. In part due to the company's Seattle founding, technology has played a large role in the change dominance. A key moment of that was the founding of its mobile app in 2009, which was very early for one of these kind of apps. And they really saw this as a digital flywheel. At the end of 2021, mobile orders accounted for nearly a quarter of all Starbucks transactions in the US. Many of those purchased through a virtual Starbucks gift card, which was previously the only way a customer could order on their phone. Today, a little under one half or 44% of all transactions at Starbucks are done with a Starbucks card. In fact, so many Starbucks customers use a Starbucks card or the Starbucks mobile app to purchase items. The Starbucks says it holds about $2.4 billion in cash that was uploaded by customers to be used later. That number exceeds the deposits at many American banks. Starbucks also gets a lot of data from that. They own a lot of that data in a way that many companies don't because they have created this whole ecosystem where people are using the Starbucks app, they're mobile ordering, and they're hooked into that Starbucks unique proprietary system. As mobile payments rise, Starbucks' business priorities have shifted. Prior to the pandemic, approximately 80% of US Starbucks transactions were on the go, either as drive-through or mobile order. Starbucks started in cities, but really has spread all around the country, including suburbs. And a lot of that is through drive-throughs. These alternate pickup options are becoming increasingly important to the company's bottom line. Especially during the pandemic, I mean, these stores have been a lifeline to Starbucks because they kept running and people could easily queue up and go and not have to enter an actual cafe. Starbucks has long said that it remains committed to a set of values established early in the company's existence. Starbucks is very committed to trying to create a connection between its baristas and its customers even in its drive-through. They talk about this on earnings calls that there are these customer connection scores. They want to make sure that everyone is feeling good about their Starbucks experience, which is getting increasingly challenging when you're ordering through a drive-through or a mobile app, you're trying to get in and out. Starbucks says those values also appear in the manner in which their stores are designed. The items you will find in the store, they really choreograph that down to where the basket of waters is placed into a store. They want this all to feel very similar. Starbucks has long touted its internal culture, which it says is built on a strong relationship between management and employees. The workers at its stores are not called workers or baristas, they're called partners. And this is very central to the company's ideology. Part of that is that all these partners do get shares in the company. It's called beanstalk. That relationship may look different going forward for some Starbucks locations. After two of three Buffalo stores voted in favor of unionization. Since then, Starbucks has thrown a huge amount of energy and resources into this issue and executives have traveled to Buffalo extensively to meet with workers, to try to understand their concerns. According to the company, they want to maintain this direct relationship with their workers. They call unions an intermediary. They do not want that relationship to be severed. But according to these workers, they who support the union, they want a more direct relationship with the company. In a statement to the Wall Street Journal, Starbucks said, Starbucks's success, past, present and future is built on how we partner together, always with our mission and values at our core. From the beginning, we've been clear in our belief that we are better together as partners without a union between us at Starbucks. And that conviction has not changed.

And again, I run into thousands of shareholders, and they're all having a good time here. And our directors have a good time. So it's just sort of a Mardi Gras. Was there anything different about this meeting, or is it the sameness that makes it so special? It's the sameness, pretty much. Working with Charlie Munger, we're not going to change the format very much. Although Brian pointed out earlier that there were a lot of kind of controversial subjects, a lot of things that caught people's attention and picked up a lot of news this time. And it's because you and Charlie say what you think, especially Charlie. Charlie says exactly what he thinks. And he thinks in colorful language, too. Have you noticed that? I have noticed that. Has that changed over the years, or is that just more the same? That's Charlie. Yeah. That's Charlie. And since you met him? Since 1959 when I met him. OK. Warren, let's talk about some of the things that really resonate with people. And maybe start where you began the annual meeting this year. And that was talking to your investors and telling them a little bit about investing some tips and lessons along the way. You kind of used it as a teaching experience at the top. Yeah. Normally, I don't do that. I mean, in fact, I can't remember when I did it. We just go right into questions and answers. But I really thought that maybe you were giving a little bit the wrong lesson, because all the questions would naturally tend toward current events. And so this time I went back, actually, to 1942 when I bought my first stock as an illustration of all the things that have happened since 1942. We've had 14 presidents, seven Republicans, seven Democrats. We've had World Wars. We had 9-11. We had the Cuban Missile Crisis. We have all kinds of things. The best single thing you could have done on March 11, 1942 when I bought my first stock was just buy an index fund and never look at a headline. Never think about stocks anymore, just like you would do if you bought a farm. You just buy the farm and let the tenant farmer run it for you. And I pointed out that if you'd put $10,000 in an index fund that reinvested dividends. And I paused for a moment to let the audience try and guess how much it amount to. And it would come to $51 million now. And the only thing you had to really believe in then is that America would win the war and that America would progress as it has ever since 1776. And that American business, if America moved forward, American business would move forward. You didn't have to worry about what stock to buy. You didn't have to worry what day to get in and out. You didn't know the Federal Reserve would exist, whatever it might be. And America works.","Warren Buffett discussed the annual meeting being similar to past years and emphasized the importance of long-term investing, using his own experience since 1942 to illustrate the benefits of buying an index fund."
113,https://youtu.be/1c_AzFDyqQA,1c_AzFDyqQA," Warren and Charlie, my name is Brent Mouillot. I'm from Winnipeg, Canada. First, thank you for devoting so much time and energy to education. I'm a better investor because of your efforts. But more importantly, I'm a better partner, friend, son, brother, and soon-to-be first-time father. There's nothing more important than these relationships, and my life is better because you're willing to pass on your experience and wisdom. My path into finance was unconventional. I worked as an engineer for 12 years, while two years ago I began a career in finance, working for the Civil Service Superannuation Board, a seven billion dollar public pension fund in Winnipeg. I work on alternative investments, which include infrastructure, private equity, and private credit. I go to work every day knowing that I'm there to benefit the hard-working, current, and future beneficiaries of the fund. Like most asset classes, alternative purchase multiples have increased. More of these assets are funded with borrow money, and the terms and covenants on this debt are essentially non-existent. With this in mind, and knowing the constraints of illiquid, closed-end funds, please give me your thoughts on private alternative investments, the relevancy in public pension funds, and your view on long-term return expectations. Yeah, if you leveraged up investments in just common stocks, and you'd figured a way so that you would have staying power if there were any market dip, I mean, you'd obviously obtain extraordinary returns. I pointed out in my investing lifetime, you know, an index fund would do 11 percent. Well, imagine how you'd have done if you'd leveraged that up 50 percent, whatever the prevailing rates were over time. So, a leveraged investment in a business is going to be an unleveraged investment in a good business a good bit of the time, but as you point out, the covenants to protect debt holders have really deteriorated in the business. And of course, you've been in an up market for businesses, and you've got a period of low interest rates. So, it's been a very good time for it. I, my personal opinion is if you take, if you take unleveraged returns against unleveraged common stocks, I do not think what is being purchased today and marketed today would work well. But if you can borrow money, if you can buy assets that will yield 7 or 8 percent, and you can borrow enough money at 4 or 5 percent, and you don't have any covenants to meet, you're going to have some bankruptcies, but you're going to also have better results in many cases. It's not something that interests us at all. We are not going to leverage up Berkshire. If we'd leveraged up Berkshire, we'd have made a whole lot more money, obviously, over the years. But both Charlie and I probably have seen some more high IQ people, really extraordinarily IQ people, destroyed by leverage. We saw long-term capital management where we had people who could do in their sleep map that we couldn't do, or at least I couldn't do, working full-time during the day. And I mean really, really smart people working with their own money, and with years and years of experience of what they were doing. And it all turned to pumpkins and mice in 1998, and actually was a source of national concern, just a few hundred people. And then we saw some of those same people, after that happened to them, once go out and do the same thing again. So it's, I would not get excited about so-called alternative investments. There's, you can get all kinds of different figures, but there may be, there's probably at least a trillion dollars committed to buying, in effect, buying businesses. And if you figure they're going to leverage them, you know, two for one on that. You may have three trillion of buying power trying to buy businesses in a, well the U.S. market may be something over 30 trillion now, but there's all kinds of businesses that aren't for sale and that thing. So the supply-demand situation for buying businesses privately and leveraging them up has changed dramatically from what it was 10 or 20 years ago. And I'm sure it doesn't happen with your Winnipeg operation, but we have seen a number of proposals from private equity funds where the returns are really not calculated in a manner that, well, they're not calculated in a manner that I would regard as honest. And so I, it's not something, if I were running a pension fund, I would be very careful about what was being offered to me. If you have a choice in Wall Street between being a great analyst or being a great salesperson, the salesperson is the way to make it. If you can raise $10 billion in a fund and you get a one and a half percent fee and you lock people up for 10 years, you know, you and your children and your grandchildren will never have to do a thing if you are the dumbest investor in the world. Charlie? Well, I think what we're doing will work more safely than what he's doing. And, but I wish him well. Yeah, Brent, you sound, actually you sound like a guy that I would hope would be working for a public pension fund because frankly most of the institutional funds, you know, well we had this terrible, right here in Omaha, and you can get a story of what happened with our Omaha Public Schools Retirement Fund. And they were doing fine until the manager started going in a different direction and the, and the trustees here, perfectly decent people, and the manager done okay to that point and it became- They're smarter in Winnipeg than they are here. Yeah, well. That was pretty bad here. It's not a fair fight actually when I'm, usually when a bunch of public officials are listening to people who are motivated to, who really just get paid for raising the money. Everything else is gravy after that, but if you run a fund and you get even 1% of a billion, you're getting $10 million a year coming in. And if you've got the money locked up for a long time, it's a very one-sided deal and, you know, I told the story of asking the guy one time in the past, how in the world can you, why in the world can you ask for two and twenty when you really haven't got any kind of evidence that you are going to do better with the money than you do in an index fund? And he said, well, that's because I can't get three and thirty. What I don't like about a lot of the pension fund investment is I think they like it because they don't have to mark it down as much as it should be in the middle of the panics. I think that's a silly reason to buy something, because you're given leniency in marking it down. Yeah, and when you commit the money, in the case of private equity often- you- they don't take the money, but you pay a fee on the money that you've committed, and of course you really have to have that money to come up with at any time. And of course it makes their return look better. If you sit there for a long time in treasury bills, which you have to hold because they can call you up and demand the money, and they don't count that. They count it in terms of getting a fee on it, but they don't count it in terms of what the so-called internal rate of return is. It's not as good as it looks, and I really do think that when you have a group sitting as a state pension fund- Or all they're doing is lying a little bit to make the money come in. Yeah, yeah, that sums it up.","Warren and Charlie advise caution in leveraged and private alternative investments, and warn public pension funds to avoid being swayed by salespeople prioritizing raising money over honest returns."
114,https://youtu.be/1QeUcfqkUzc,1QeUcfqkUzc," Fear is extraordinarily contagious and we saw that in September of 2008 like we've never seen it before in financial markets. Music On Saturday I had a long standing commitment to go to Edmonton and my wife and I went up with another couple and we checked into our hotel room about 6 o'clock or so and amazingly I got a call. I didn't think anybody knew I was there. Music I said I'm going to this performance with another couple. Send me a fax, describe exactly what you want and tell me how much you will pay. So I came back from the performance and no fax and so I called the manager of the hotel and said there must be a fax someplace and he said no there's no fax and I couldn't figure that out. Well they called me on a cell phone which I didn't have, a little flip phone which I still have and it was beyond my technical comprehension to figure out if that's what they'd done because actually they said they'd send a fax and the following summer I was arriving in Sun Valley with my daughter and she said there's a message on your phone. I said I don't know how to bring it up and so she brought it up for me and of course it was a message from that Saturday night saying call us and do this or that so it's a little bit late. So you don't think the message would have changed? No I could not make a commitment like that. Music This is a 10k that Lehman Brothers and this goes back a little before the panic. Lehman was looking for money at that time and they approached Berkshire. I came down to the office at night and made these little notes on here of things that were red flags and you'll see a number of pages here and you had to get to page 150 or 200 but there was clearly a lot of trouble there. By the time I got through I decided that we were not in a position to lend money to Lehman. Music How are you feeling? How do you think? Music On Lehman weekend on Friday preceding the weekend I got a call from AIG and AIG was going to run out of money the following week. They'd done some very foolish things in their financial products operation so I looked at this and finally decided that there was no way that I could come up with a cash offer that could be done in the following week or really probably the following month. So I called them back late that night. I wanted to convey to them promptly that I just wasn't a prospect. I came back on Sunday again a long previously scheduled dinner but before we'd gone I was still getting more calls on AIG and I went through dinner and I think I behaved reasonably well. I was still wondering what was going on obviously with AIG in New York but there was nothing to be done. AIG was just going to run out of money big time in the next day or two and Lehman was going to go under unless something was happening that I didn't know about. Music One of the lessons of the 2008 and 9 experience, well really the 2008 experience was the fact that every company in the United States was a domino and those dominoes were placed right next to each other. So when they started toppling everything was in line and they were very very close to it and it's really like the old movies you know where there's a run on the bank. It's getting so guys money ain't safe unless it's in his sock. If you have a run on a bank and there's a big line in front of the bank and you've got your money in that bank you're going to get in line and if the president of the bank comes out and says our capital ratio is 13% you don't care because you don't know what a capital ratio is and you don't know whether he knows what one is and he's probably lying to you. A company like Lehman or any major financial institution depends on people being willing to do business with them tomorrow and lend them money tomorrow and take their word the next day and nobody has to do business with Lehman or any other institution. Once they lose confidence it's all over. Music","Warren Buffett reflects on the financial crisis of 2008 and how the contagious fear impacted every company in the US. He shares experiences with Lehman Brothers and AIG, emphasizing the importance of confidence in the financial industry."
115,https://youtu.be/2c2-RANz3gk,2c2-RANz3gk," This question is from Ken Scarbeck in Indianapolis. He says, with the full understanding that Warren had no input on the Amazon purchase and that relative to Berkshire, it's likely a small stake, the investment still caught me off guard. I'm wondering if I should begin to think differently about Berkshire looking out, say, 20 years. Might we be seeing a shift in investment philosophy away from value investing principles that the current management has practiced for 70 years? Amazon is a great company, yet it would seem its heady shares 10 years into a bull market appear to conflict with being fearful when others are greedy. Considering this and other recent investments like StoneCo, should we be preparing for a change in the price versus value decisions that built Berkshire? Yeah, it's interesting that the term value investing came up because I can assure you that both managers who, and one of them, bought some Amazon stock in the last quarter, which will get reported in another week or 10 days, he is a value investor. The idea that value is somehow connected to book value or low price earnings ratios or anything, as Charlie has said, all investing is value investing. I mean, you're putting out some money now to get more later on, and you're making a calculation as to the probabilities of getting that money and when you'll get it and what interest rates will be in between, and all the same calculation goes into it whether you're buying some bank at 70% of book value or you're buying Amazon at some very high multiple of reported earnings. The people making the decision on Amazon are absolutely much value investors as I was when I was looking around for all these things selling below working capital years ago. So that has not changed. The two people that, one of whom made the investment in Amazon, they are looking at many hundreds of securities and they can look at more than I can because they're managing less money and their universe, possible universe is greater, but they are looking for things that they feel they understand what will be developed by that business between now and judgment day and cash. Current sales can make some difference, current profit margins can make some difference, tangible assets, excess cash, excess debt, all of those things go into making a calculation as to whether they should buy A versus B versus C, and they are absolutely following value principles. They don't necessarily agree with each other or agree with me, but they are very smart. They are totally committed to Berkshire and they're very good human beings on top of it. So I don't second guess them on anything. Charlie doesn't second guess me on, in 60 years he's never second guessed me on an investment. And the considerations are identical when you buy Amazon versus some say bank stock that looks cheap statistically against book value or earnings or something of the sort. In the end, it all goes back to Aesop who in 600 BC said, you know, that a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. And when we buy Amazon, we try and figure out whether, or the fellow that bought it tries to figure out whether there's three or four or five in the bush and how long it'll take to get to the bush, how certain he is that he's gonna get to the bush, you know, and who else is gonna come and try and take the bush away and all of that sort of thing. And we do the same thing and it really, it really, despite a lot of equations you'll learn in business school, the basic equation is that of Aesop and your success in investing depends on how well you were able to figure out how certain that bush is, how far away it is and what the worst case is instead of two birds being there and only one being there and the possibilities of four or five or 10 or 20 being there and that will guide me, that will guide my successors in investment management at Berkshire and I think they'll be right more often than they're wrong. Charlie? Well, I, Warren and I are a little older than some people and, Yeah, I'm near everybody. And we're not the most flexible, probably in the whole world. And of course, if something is extreme and this is internet development happens and you don't catch it, why other people are going to blow by you. And I don't mind not having caught Amazon early. The guy is kind of a miracle worker. It's very peculiar. I give myself a pass on that. But I feel like a horse's ass for not identifying Google better. I think Warren feels the same way. Yeah. We screwed up. He's saying we blew it. And we did have some insights into that because we were using them at Geico and we were seeing the results produced and we saw that we were paying $10 a click or whatever it might have been for something that had a marginal cost of them, it was exactly zero. And we saw it was working for us. So, we knew it was- We can see in our own operations how well that Google advertising was working. And we just sat there sucking our thumbs. Right. Yeah. So, we're ashamed. We atone. We're trying to atone. Maybe Apple was atonement. When he says sucking our thumbs, I'm just glad he didn't use some other example.","Warren Buffett defends Berkshire Hathaway's investment in Amazon, stating that their investment philosophy has not changed and that they evaluate potential investments based on projected returns, risks, and intrinsic value."
116,https://youtu.be/2Wb01_OnKZ0,2Wb01_OnKZ0," Do you think it's likely that we will experience a major increase in interest rates in the upcoming decades, like for example in the period between 1950 and 1980? Well that of course is a very intelligent question and a very difficult question. When you throw money, when you print money on the scale that modern nations are printing it, Japan, the United States, Europe, etc., we're getting into new territory in terms of size. The Japanese bought back not only a lot of their own debt, but a lot of their common stocks. So the Federal Reserve system, you can't imagine how much money printing Japan has done. They haven't had all that much inflation and it's still a very admirable civilization. In fact you could argue that Japan is one of the more admirable civilizations in the whole world. And in spite of all this very extreme government money printing they've done, and they haven't had terrible consequences. Now they've had 25 years of stasis with living standards not improving very much. I don't think that came from their macroeconomic policies. I think that came from the rise of tough competition for their export powerhouse from China and Korea. But at any rate it's weird what's happening and nobody knows for sure how it's going to work out. I think it's encouraging that Japan could print as much money as it has and remain as civilized and calm and admirable as it has. And so I hope to God the United States has a similar happy outcome. But I think the Japanese are better adapted for stasis than we are. I think it's a duty-filled civilized bunch of people, a lot of them older, not many young people, and they just suck it in and cope. In our country we have terrible tensions. It's way harder to run a country which is not mono-ethnic like Japan. There's some professor at Harvard that has written extensively on this subject. It's way harder to run a nation like the United States with different ethnicities and groups and so forth than it is to run Japan. Japan is basically sort of a mono-ethnic civilization which is proud of its ethnicity. And of course they can cope with troubles more than, better than some other people can. Charlie, Steve Cosco writes in. But we don't know where we're going. There's never anything quite like what we're doing now. And we do know from what's happened in other nations, if you try and print too much money it eventually causes terrible trouble. And we are closer to terrible trouble than we've been in the past, but it may still be a long way off. I certainly hope so.","The speaker suggests that predicting a major increase in interest rates is difficult due to large-scale money printing. It mentions Japan as an example and hopes the US has a similar outcome, but notes the challenges of running a multi-ethnic nation."
117,https://youtu.be/4IhSkIUhjF0,4IhSkIUhjF0," Are you concerned about the volatility in the financial markets today? Do you think something needs to be done to reduce it? I love volatility. I remember when in 1972 the market went down dramatically and Taco Bell went from 14 to 1. They had no debt. They never had a restaurant close. I started buying at 7, but I kept on to it and it went to 1. It was the largest position in Magellan in 1978. It was bought out by $42 by Pepsi-Cola. I think it would have gone to $400 if they didn't buy it out. I think volatility is terrific. I think these callers are very important. I don't think the market going up 80 points one day and down 80 the next is a good thing for the public. I think that's not a very good thing. I think all these callers and all these other things to keep the volatility down each day is important. But the market is going to go up and down. Human nature hasn't changed a lot in 25,000 years. Some event will come out of left field and the market will go down or the market will go up. So volatility will occur and markets will continue to have these ups and downs. I think that's a great opportunity if people can understand what they own. If they don't understand what they own, they can own mutual funds, try to figure out mutual funds they own and keep adding to it. Basically, corporate profits have grown about 8% a year historically. So corporate profits double about every nine years. The stock market ought to double about every nine years. So I think the next market is about 3,800 today, 3,700. I'm pretty convinced the next 3,800 points will be up. It won't be down. The next 500 points, the next 600 points, I don't know which way they're going. So the market ought to double in the next eight or nine years. It ought to double again in the eight or nine years after that. Profits will go up 8% a year and stocks will fall. That's all there is to it. But you should study history and history is the important thing you learn from. What you learn from history is the market goes down. It goes down a lot. The math is simple. There's been 93 years a century. This is easy to do. The market's had 50 declines of 10% or more. So 50 declines in 93 years. About once every two years the market falls 10%. We call that a correction. That's a euphemism for losing a lot of money rapidly. We call it a correction. So 50 declines in 93 years. About once every two years the market falls 10%. Of those 50 declines, 15 have been 25% or more. That's known as a bear market. We've had 15 declines in 93 years. So every six years the market's going to have a 25% decline. That's all you need to know. You need to know the market's going to go down sometime. If you're not ready for that, you shouldn't own stocks. And it's good when it happens. If you like a stock at 14 and it goes to 6, that's great. You understand the company, you look at the balance sheet and they're doing fine. You're hoping to get to 22 with it. 14 to 22 is terrific. 6 to 22 is exceptional. So you take advantage of these declines. They're going to happen. No one knows when they're going to happen. People tell you about it after the fact that they predicted it, but they predicted it 53 times. So you can take advantage of the volatility in the market if you understand what you own.","Speaker values volatility as it provides opportunities for investors who understand their assets. Emphasizes the importance of studying history and preparing for market declines.  financial markets have experienced 50 declines of 10% or more, occurring about once every two years, while 15 of these declines have been 25% or more, equivalent to a bear market, happening approximately every six years. Understanding and capitalizing on market volatility can be advantageous, as historical trends show that corporate profits tend to grow around 8% annually, leading to market doubling approximately every eight or nine years."
118,https://youtu.be/5mOs4SRYwco,5mOs4SRYwco," Thank you. Bill Ackman from New York, New York. Four of the handful of AAA-rated companies, AIG, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and MBIA, are under formal investigation for accounting shenanigans and are in the process of restating their financials. Like Charlie said before, I think of a AAA-rated company as an exemplar, a company that should behave with the highest accounting and ethical standards. My questions this leads me to are how can investors comfortably invest in any financial service company when even when a decent percentage of the AAA-rated companies have false and misleading financials? And I guess the follow-up question is why don't the rating agencies do some independent due diligence from an accounting standpoint so that they can help serve as a watch on this issue? Well, financial companies are more difficult to analyze than many companies. I mean, it is more, if you take the insurance business, you know, the biggest single element that is very difficult to evaluate, even if you own the company, is the loss and loss adjustment expense reserve. And that has a huge impact on reported earnings of any given period. And the shorter the period, the more the impact can be from just small changes in assumptions. You know, we carry, we'll say, 45 billion of loss reserves, but, you know, if I had to bet my life on whether 45 billion turned out to be a little over, a little under, I mean, it'd be, I think, a long time. And you could just as easily have a figure of 45 and a half billion or 44 and a half billion. And if you were concerned about reporting given earnings in a given period, that would be an easy game to play. In a bank, you know, it basically is whether the loans are any good. And I've been on the boards of banks, and that's, you know, I've gotten surprises. It's tough to tell. It's financial companies, if you're analyzing something like WD-40, you know, or C's Candy or our brick business, whatever. They may have good or bad prospects, but you're not likely to be fooling yourself much about what's going on currently. But with financial institutions, it's much tougher. Then you add throw-in derivatives on top of it. And, you know, it's, no one probably knows perfectly what some of it, or even within a reasonable range, the exact condition of of the biggest banks in the world. But that brings you back to the due diligence question of the agencies. You had very high-grade, very smart, financially smart people on the boards of both Freddie and Fannie, and yet, you know, one was five billion and one was apparently nine billion. Those are big numbers. And I don't think those people were negligent. It's just, it's very, very tough to know precisely what's going on in a financial institution. Charlie and I were directors of Solomon, and Charlie was on the audit committee. And I forget the size of a few of those things that you found, but, you know, what, that you found, but, you know, what wasn't found. And that doesn't mean the people below are crooks or anything like that. It just means that it's, it's very tough with thousands and thousands and thousands of complicated transactions, sometimes involving the computations involving multiple variables. It can be, it can be very hard to figure out where things stand at any given moment. And of course, when the numbers get huge on both sides, and you get small changes in these huge numbers, they have this incredible effect on quarterly or yearly figures because it all comes lumped in, those adjustments come lumped in a short period of time. So I just think you have to accept the fact that insurance, banking, finance companies, we've seen all kinds of finance companies, both frauds and just big, big mistakes over time, just one after another over the years. And it's just a more dangerous field to analyze. It doesn't mean you can't make money on it. We've made a lot of money on it, but, but it's difficult. Now, obviously a GEICO where you're insuring pretty much the same thing, auto drivers, and you get, your statistics are much more valid in something like that than they will be if you're, if you're taking something that, like asbestos liability, you're subject to far greater errors in estimation. It doesn't mean the people aren't operating a good faith, but, you know, I would take, just take the asbestos estimates of the 20 largest insurance companies. I will bet you they're way off, but I don't know in which direction. And that's, that's sort of the nature of financial companies. I wouldn't fault the rating agencies in terms of not being able to, to dig into the, the financials and find things that, that, you know, all of the companies that you've talked about have had big name auditors and our auditors at Berkshire, how many hours did they spend last year? I don't know what it would be, probably 60, 70,000 hours. And I'm sure another, you know, if you take major banks, they're spending more than that. But, you know, can they be certain of the numbers? I doubt it. Charlie? Yeah. Warren is obviously correct that where you've got complexity, which by its very nature, provides better opportunities to be mistaken and not have it come to notice or to be fraudulent and have it not be found out. You're going to get more fraud and mistakes than you are if you're selling a business where you shovel sand out of the river and sell it by the truck load. Just as a business that sells natural gas is going to have more explosions than a business that sells sand, a business like these major financial institutions by its nature is going to have way more problems. And that will always be true. And it's true when the financial institutions are owned by governments. In fact, some of the worst financial reporting in the world is done by governments and governments, institutions like government banks in China, et cetera. So if you don't like the lack of perfect accounting in financial institutions, you're in the wrong world.","Investing in financial companies, especially insurance and banking, can be challenging due to their complexity, errors in estimation, and potential for mistakes and fraud."

Well if you're running a Deficit getting close to five percent when things are really good, you know That's a new world And nobody's neither the Republicans or Democrats are particularly concerned about it And we're not having a lot of inflation that wasn't supposed to happen, you know But it's happening.

Okay, fair enough Income inequality wealth inequality, you've talked about the earned income tax credit Is there more to it than that? Should we adjust tax policy? It seems to be going the other way right now Well, it's going the other way, but I think I think I think the earned income tax credit is the best way To put money in the pockets of people that don't fit well into the market system But that are perfectly decent citizens and that have made a good bit of the success somebody like I've had with Berkshire Something possible it wouldn't have happened without the America we have and If you go back Go back 200 years and we're all working on 80% of us are working on farms the person that's the best at that Working on that farm whatever it may be It's worth maybe Twice the ones that's the worst, you know I mean that's the difference between super talent and no talent in the farm economy picking cotton or whatever it may be Now if you're the best Middleweight fighter in the world, you know, you may get 20 or 30 million dollars and and and if you are just a good citizen Raise nice kids help in the neighborhood and everything else, but you don't have market related skills You'd be you'd be good on that farm still and you would be earning something comparable to most of the people around you But you don't have something now that as it gets more and more specialized and it's going to continue to get more and more Specialized and it's going to continue to get more specialized you want two things for that person you want them to have a decent life I mean they live in a country with 60,000 of GDP per person you want them to you want them to have a decent life And they can I Also, I also think you want them to have a feeling of accomplishment So you wanted to have a job assuming that they're not handicapped in some way you wanted to have a job But the minimum wage would be one way say well Make sure that they have enough money in their pocket, but that's got a lot of effects in disturbing the market system They just need more cash. They don't need a higher wage They need more cash in their pocket and and the government at a relatively low cost Can provide a decent living for anybody that's living that's working 40 hours a week and has a couple of children And we've gone in that direction and it's sort of bipartisan I find both Republicans and Democrats for I think it would be better not to have one annual payment You know that they get it monthly And I think there's various things you could do but you want it you want them to feel part of the system and you want to get them have them get as As more and more of these golden eggs are laid you want to get get get a little more of their share I mean if we don't do that and the Democrats win it's possible We get you know big taxes on wealthy people free college for all and those are bigger plans You want you want more money in the pockets of every of everybody's willing to work? Or is unable to work and we can do it a rich family would do that You know if I had six or seven kids, and I had some business I wanted to pass on you know you'd pick the most able person or money because that's the market system to do that But you make sure that all seven of the family participated You'd give more to the one that you might give more to the one that that that kept producing the golden eggs you would but You wouldn't just say to the other you know the one at the lowest end who might be the best kid of all and in most respects You know he's the one that shares with everybody and there's all guys You wouldn't it wouldn't say to that em or that you know too bad, but that's just the way the market system works you know The Go got your have your spouse get a job and Look for housing someplace right Why don't we do a update about the health care initiative?

You know without without really Making you less competitive among other things in the world so everybody thought the system needed some adjustment Just not there part of the system and and that's very human. I do the same thing I'm sure if I was in the same place, so it's there's an enormous resistance to change while a similar acknowledgement the change is Will be needed and of course if the private sector doesn't supply that over a period of time You know people will say then you know we give up. We got to turn this over to government, which will probably be even worse How often do you talk to Jamie and Jeff about it? I know Todd combs I think that Todd really does all the work at our but if this works give Todd 100% of the credit From the from the Berkshire standpoint does Haven have to buy companies to gain expertise, and what do you know it? I don't know what is the plan. I mean the plan is to support a very very very good thinker on this subject who's Once is a practicing physician and who commands the respect of the medical community To in effect figure out some way so that we can deliver even better care and have People feel better about their care, too. I mean they have to perceive that they're receiving better care over time and and and stop The march upward of cost relative to the country's output. We've got this incredible economic machine But but we shouldn't we shouldn't be spending 18% when other countries are doing something pretty comfortable in terms of doctors per capita hospital beds per capita all the very top stuff in medicine I think is very much concentrated in this country, and that's great In this country and that's great I want us to be the leader, but I just don't I think we're paying a price if we're paying seven extra points of GDP that's one point four trillion a year. Yeah Is the administration focusing by focusing on drug prices is that sort of a rabbit hole is that missing? I know I mean they They're trying and and and and Congress generally I mean you talk the average Congressman They read they regard as a problem And and they may and they see specific instances, you know of drug prices or something like that, but It's a big problem to change I mean the troubles it intersects in so many ways and that and that's why We've got Kwandi heading it and we've got three Bigger size organizations backing and we're not trying to do it to make money I mean that is not a goal that we end up with some business that that we make money off of And will he be talking to health insurers for instance well?

120,https://youtu.be/5Smk-52owVo,5Smk-52owVo," In the past, you have touched on certain compensation arrangements with key executives. Could you please provide some specific examples of compensation arrangements within Berkshire that speak to incentivizing good behavior while not penalizing the manager for size or the relative ease or difficulty of the business or industry? Thank you. Well, that is a very, very good question and a very, very tough question because some of our��� He really doesn't want to answer. Well, some of our managers���no, some of our managers are in businesses that are just much easier. I mean, we've bought into a variety of businesses. People are obviously influenced by what pay arrangements are elsewhere. They wouldn't be human if they weren't. And trying to come to the right answer when you have different degrees of capital intensity, very different degrees of basic profitability, and how much you scale up based on size, because there is an incentive to grow businesses. Usually if businesses get much larger, everybody from the CEO down expects to earn more money for something where they really bring the same amount of intensity and work and ability to it. It is really a tough question. I think that if you engage compensation consultants at public companies, which they all do, they're going to recommend things that cause them to have CEOs recommend them to other companies. It's just you're working against human nature when you have an arrangement like that. I would say that we have obviously kept a very, very, very high percentage of the managers that we hope to have stay with us, in fact, just about 100%. I think people do like to make their own decisions. They do like recognition. Most people, they like doing a good job and they like the fact that we understand it, and compensation is part of that, but it's not the whole thing. I wish I could give you some precise formulas, but there aren't any. I really don't, Warren. It's an advantage at Berkshire to keep our individual deals private. There would be no advantage to just publishing them all. No, we're not going to do that. No, of course not. So what we're saying, he makes all those decisions personally. He's got every formula in the book, and he keeps them all private. That's our system. We publish what the directors are paying. We publish what we have to, yes.","Warren Buffett discusses creating fair compensation arrangements for managers without being influenced by external consultants, recognizing good performance, and keeping individual deals private.The speaker suggests that engaging compensation consultants can sometimes lead to recommendations influenced by their own interests.

121,https://youtu.be/5uLIghPIf0I,5uLIghPIf0I," You think CEOs make too much money? Do you think television reporters make too much money? I do. Yeah? Well, I mean, I don't know if television reporters are making such a great amount of money and then those at the bottom of the television business aren't making much. CEOs are... I'm just guessing that... The wealth of CEOs is going up at an amazingly high rate relative to the rank in five. I'm just guessing that someone must have decided that you in the seat draws more viewers than if you and your cameramen switch places. And therefore you command a higher wage for the job you do, even though when I chatted with the fellow back there, he seemed... You know, I liked him a hell of a lot. He's a good guy. Very good guy. And probably works hard. But the spread between what I make and what he makes is probably way small compared to what you made compared to the rank in file, no? Or what any CEO makes to the rank in file, no? It's a widespread and it's dictated by... You know, somebody somewhere must have the misapprehension that people in those jobs are doing a job that the next best job who could be in that job wouldn't fulfill. Do you think it's out of whack, though? Out of whack with what, Scott? Well, I mean, I'm just asking you a question that Jamie Dimon was asked this past week or a week before on 60 Minutes by Leslie Stahl. I mean, that sort of gets back to the heart of the conversation we're having. I think what you have to decide, it's like if you film a movie and you get the number one box office star to be in that movie and you think what is that movie worth with the number one box office star in it versus the number 40 box office star? And if somebody thinks they can make an extra $50 million by having the number one guy in it, what's that guy worth as a differential over the other guy? Every industry has its own market mechanisms. I don't think anybody should apologize where they end up in that process. And then you can ask them what they do with the money, whether they're good citizens, whether they give back to society, whether it serves an important social purpose or whether it's counterproductive. I think these are all fair things. I'm not criticizing you for asking the question, although maybe you shouldn't ask it 10 different times. Well, I think it's sort of the gets to the heart of why we're having a conversation about income inequality and why people like Elizabeth Warren put people on Wall Street and television. I don't think the whole economic system hinges on whether Taylor Swift or the NFL quarterback versus the lineman or this or that, what the relative proportion. I think it's an important thing if you're talking on the side about that particular industry and what it can afford. But I think the real issue for the overall economy in a macro sense is, again, what should be the extent of government participation. That's one of the big debates now, whether the government should take over health care, whether the government should take over housing, all those elements. Medicare for all, things like that. And then the distribution question is one of calibration and degree. And where I am on that spectrum, which was the observation that I made, was that I may be in the middle. I'm not an extreme end of that spectrum. I grew up in public housing in New York City. My dad worked nights at the post office. I might surprise you in that I never behaved in my life to maximize my income over other considerations. And so I might find myself kind of as a, you know, kind of directionally aligned with people who would like to see a more equally calibrated kind of distribution of the system. But I don't want to do anything to impede the wealth creation of the system. And that's a little bit what the debate should be about, if you ask me. Thank you.","Speaker believes that income inequality is due to market mechanisms and individual choices. Government participation is essential in the economy, and a discussion is necessary to determine the calibration and degree of wealth distribution."
122,https://youtu.be/65FIl71bZKQ,65FIl71bZKQ," Last month on Lewis Rukeyser you summed up your investment philosophy as buy everything and hold it forever. Do you still subscribe to that in light of what the market has been doing or would you unload some things now? No, my theory is not subject to the ups and downs, the unpredictable peregrinations of the stock market. It's painful to do, but I think the idea of owning the stock market is the best approach to equity investing. And perhaps I didn't make that thoroughly clear there. I have never felt that equity should be the only portion of an investor's long-term program. I myself am about 50% stocks, 50% bonds, for example. I was brought up when I came into this business in 1951 with the Wellington Fund, which was and is and I hope always will be a conservative balanced fund. But I think the idea of buying and holding forever and not trying to make adjustments requires that you've gotten it right in the first place. That you can only hold tight if you've bought right, if you will. And that is to say have an asset allocation that has something to do with how many years you have to accumulate money, how much resources you have at stake, how much income you need, and how much courage you have to ride out the peregrinations of the market. So you've got to take all that into account from that simple statement. You are the godfather of index funds aimed at the average investor. And this questioner points out that actively managed funds have outperformed indexed over the last two years. Is there a case then for market timing? What should you do when the index funds are losing money? Well, as my friend Jim Glassman quoted me in his op-ed piece in the Wall Street Journal yesterday, I quote, I don't even remember where I made, but it said, I don't know anybody who has ever been successful in timing the market. I don't even know anybody who knows anybody who has ever been successful in timing the market. Last year, these last two years, the index, S&P indexes outperformed roughly half of the funds, a little bit less last year, just about half this year. I don't regard that as a significant long-term sign at all. First of all, the number of funds is not a relevant statistic. We use it because it's convenient. But if you've got a few little funds in there that do well, they count just as much as a few big funds. The reality is, no matter what the statistics tell you, indexing always wins. I say that because index is delivering a market return, and all those investors out there are by definition getting the market return themselves less cost. So if the statistics don't capture that index advantage, it will be corrected next year or the next year. And by the way, if you look at even the last 15 years, counting those last two years, the index has outperformed about 75% of all active managers. Someone out there will want to take careful notes here, because we're going to go from the general to the very specific. For the past 15 months, I've been investing $1,200 per month in Schwab Mutual Funds. He or she doesn't say which Schwab Funds. Should I continue, or is there a better place for that money these days? Well, far be it for me to get into more trouble with Mr. Schwab than I'm in already. But leaving aside the infinite variety of mutual funds they could be buying through any kind of a mutual fund marketplace like Charles Schwab's, the answer is yes, continue to invest. I've told particularly young people in the office who are really petrified by this market decline that it's the best thing that ever happens to them. If you think about it logically, of course it's wonderful. I mean, think of, say, the young man I was talking to yesterday. He's probably 25 or 26 years old, and he's got the rest of his life to invest. I said, well, let's suppose that Chris, Scott his name is, I said, let's suppose, Chris, that the market's going to end up at Jim Glassman's $36,000 by the time you retire. Do you want to be investing all your money when the Dow is at $35,000, or invest it all when it's $9,000? Just think about that for a minute. In other words, you want a long time to invest at low prices, and it's certainly a frightening advantage for those of us who have some money at work in the market today to think of this as a blessing, but it is a blessing because in the long run, investing depends on accumulating money at sound prices and not inflated prices like we have. I also think the general economy and the financial markets are well served by a return to reality. When you leave reality and depart from the laws of gravity, there's nothing but bad things that can happen, and the higher you fly, the more you fall. We flew quite high enough, and I think it's a blessing, maybe a blessing in heavy disguise, a blessing that we've come back a little bit toward the ground. Speaking of coming back toward the ground, this investor's stocks are really down. Dr. Koop, just for feet. Is that quickly, pharmaceuticals? Cisco, lucent technologies. Should I sell? I haven't heard a list like that. He even makes those tech funds I told you about seem like heroes. I don't have any comment on those individual stocks. They are hugely depressed. I think Dr. Koop I read the other day is in danger, the stock is in danger of becoming delisted. I think it sold up in the mid-30s, $30, and now is something like 19 cents. It wasn't a good turn, and it's very painful for people, for speculators, where people let greed overwhelm their good judgment to get hurt, but will they bounce back? I guess the answer to that group of stocks without knowing much about Quigley's Pharmaceutical and being very nervous about Dr. Koop is companies like Lucent will come back in time. I don't think there's much question about that, but to own a handful of individual stocks, I don't think is sound investing, and to obviously jump on the bandwagon at a silly time is, I feel very sorry for the investor, but I don't know how to help him or her.","Investors should have an asset allocation plan based on their resources, income needs, and market courage. Index funds always win in the long run.Bogle also advises against holding a handful of individual stocks and highlights the importance of accumulating money at sound prices over inflated ones.

123,https://youtu.be/6swZ183go5s,6swZ183go5s," I think the people on the top of the heap ought to voluntarily take less as part of their duty to the Republic. In other words, I don't think everybody who's been especially favored should take the last dollar that he or she can get. I think we all have an obligation to dampen these fires of envy. When you rise to a certain point in life, I think you should voluntarily and eagerly take less than you're worth. Executive compensation. This is front and center, of course, in the discussion over Coca-Cola that was just had in the meeting. How does one determine what is excessive? Well, of course that's a hard question, but my views on this are different from most people. You start paying directors of corporations $200,000 or $300,000 a year. It creates a daisy chain of reciprocity where they keep raising the CEO and he keeps recommending more pay for the directors. In the end, I think the pay of both CEOs and directors in this country, in the biggest corporations, I think the pay is too high. When you have boards, Warren Buffett, for example, said he's been on 19 boards over 55 years and never seen a board vote down a compensation package. Oh, I'm sure that's quite accurate. Is that indicative of a larger issue? Sure. The answer is there are social forces in place that are causing too much pay for some people. And when you try and fix it by paying the directors more, it's like trying to fix a fire by pouring gasoline on it. Berkshire doesn't pay its directors. Is that the answer? We don't pay them very much. Well, there again, you see, I think the people on the top should voluntarily take less. And I think if I were running the world, directors wouldn't be paid at all. I would treat the directors like the trustees of Stanford or something who not only don't get paid, but they're expected to give. Then how do you incentivize the people at the top to achieve climb to the top? Well, I think being a director is different from being an executive. I think you'd get plenty of wonderful directors at American companies if you didn't pay them at all. You're saying also the CEO shouldn't make as much, right? Yes. So how do you incentivize them to want to work to get there? I think, do you really think that a man who craves power and significance and likes decision making, is running a big company and has one of the most important public ranks in America and he makes $5 million a year, do you really think he'd work a lot more effectively if you raised him to seven? I think the whole thing is insane. Does the Supreme Court work harder, less hard because they don't get paid like corporate executives? We have some corporate directors who draw more pay than members of the Supreme Court. That's crazy.",Warren Buffett believes excessive executive compensation is a problem and suggests that high salaries for incentivizing people at the top are insane. He also proposes that directors of corporations should not be paid at all.
124,https://youtu.be/7nHQzSpDncA,7nHQzSpDncA," Hi Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger, this is Whitney Tilson, a shareholder from New York. For many years, both of you have been warning about the dangers of derivatives, at one point calling them financial weapons of mass destruction. Yet every year, tens of trillions of dollars of derivatives are bought and sold. It just seems to be getting bigger and bigger and almost certainly improperly accounted for. And so I was wondering if you could comment specifically if you have any thoughts on how much longer this might go on. Do you see anything imminent that could derail this ever-inflating bubble? What might trigger it? And who should be doing what to try and mitigate this looming danger? Well, we've tried to do a little to mitigate it ourselves by talking about it, but the, you're right, and it isn't the derivative itself. I mean, there's nothing evil about a derivative instrument. As I mentioned, we have 60 some of them at Berkshire and on Monday I will go over the directors, with the directors I'll go over all 60 some and believe me, we'll make money out of those particular instruments. But the usage of them on an expanding basis, more and more imaginative ways of using them, introduces essentially more and more leverage into the system. And it's an invisible or largely invisible sort of leverage. If you go back to the 1920s, after the crash, the United States government held hearings. They decided that leverage margin in those days as they call it, leverage contributed to perhaps the crash itself and certainly to the extent of the crash. And it was like pouring gasoline on a fire was when people's holdings got tripped, you know, when stocks went down 10 percent, people had to sell another 10 percent, more people had to sell and so on. Leverage was regarded as dangerous and the federal and the United States government empowered the Federal Reserve to regulate margin requirements, regulate leverage. And that was taken very seriously. And for decades, it was a source of real attention. If you went to a bank and tried to borrow money on a stock, they may just sign certain papers as to that you weren't in violation of the margin requirements and they policed it and it was taken quite seriously when the Fed increased or decreased margin requirements. It was a signal of how they felt about the level of speculation. Well, the introduction of derivatives and index future, all that sort of thing, has just totally made any regulation of margin requirements a joke. They still exist and, you know, it's an anachronism. So I believe, I think Charlie probably agrees with me, that we may not know where exactly the danger begins and where and at what point it becomes a super danger and so on. We certainly don't know what will end it precisely. We don't know when it will end precisely. But we probably, at least I believe, that it will go on and increase to the point where at some point there'll be some very unpleasant things happen in markets because of it. You saw one example of what can happen under forced sales back in October 19th, 1987, when you had so-called portfolio insurance. Well, not portfolio insurance, and you ought to go back and read the literature for the couple years preceding that. I mean, this was something that came out of academia and it was regarded as a great advance in financial theories and everything. It was a joke. It was a bunch of stop-loss orders, which, you know, go back 150 years or something, except that they were done automatically and in large scale by institutions and they were merchandise. People paid a lot of money to people to teach them how to put in a stop-loss order. And what happened, of course, was that if you have a whole series of stop-loss orders by very big institutions, you are pouring gasoline on fire. And when October 19th came along, you had a 22% shrink in the value of American business, caused essentially by a doomsday machine. A dead hand was selling as each level got hit. And three weeks earlier, you know, people were proclaiming the beauty of this. Well, that is nothing compared. It was a formal arrangement to have this dynamic hedging or portfolio insurance sell things. But you have the same thing existing when you have fund operators operating with billions and in aggregate trillions of dollars leveraged who will respond to the same stimulus. They have what we would call a crowded trade, but they don't know it. It's not a formal crowded trade. It's just that they're all ready to sell if a certain given signal or a certain given activity occurs. And when you get that coupled with extreme leverage, which derivatives allow, you will someday get a very, very chaotic situation. I have no idea when. I have no idea what the exogenous factor. I didn't know that shooting some Archduke, you know, would start World War I. And I have no idea what will cause this kind of a thing. But it'll happen. Yeah. And of course, the the accounting being deficient enormously contributes to the risks. If you get paid enormous bonuses based on reporting profits that don't exist, you're going to keep doing whatever causes those phony profits to keep appearing on the books. And what makes that so difficult is that most of the accounting profession doesn't even recognize how stupidly it is behaving. And. One of the people in charge of accounting standards said to me, well, this is better, this derivative accounting, because it's mark to market. And don't we want current information? And I said, yes, but if you mark to model and and you create the models and your accountants, trust your models and you can just report whatever profit you want, as long as you keep expanding the positions bigger and bigger and bigger, the way human nature is, that will cause terrible results and terrible behavior. And this person said to me, well, you just don't understand accounting. If four years ago or whenever it was when we started to liquidate Jennery's portfolio, we had a we had reserves set up for in the hundreds of millions and all sorts of things. And our auditor and I emphasize any other of the big four auditors absolutely would have attested to the fact that our stuff was marked to market. I just wish I'd sold the portfolio to the auditors that day. Maybe 400 million better off. So it it's a real problem. Now, there's one thing that's really quite interesting to me. You know, if if I owe you on my dry cleaning bill or something, fifteen dollars and they're auditing the dry cleaners, they check with me and they find out that I owe you fifteen dollars and it's all fine. If they're auditing me, they find out that I owe the dry cleaner fifteen bucks. There are only four big auditing firms, you know, basically in this country. And I will. And so in many cases, if they're auditing my side of the derivative transaction, you know what I'm valuing it at, the same firm may often be valuing or attesting to the value of the of the mark by the person on the other side of the contract. I will guarantee you that if you add up the marks on both sides, they don't they don't equate out to zero. We we have 60 some contracts, you know, and I will bet that people are valuing them differently on the other side than we value them themselves. And it won't be to the disadvantage of the trader on the other side. I don't get paid based on how ours are valued. So I've got no reason to want to game the system. But there are people out on the other side that do have reasons to game the system. So if I'm valuing some contract at plus a million dollars for Berkshire, that contract on the other side, it's just one piece of paper. Should be valued at a minus one million by somebody else. But I think you probably have cases. And this is I'm talking about our auditors and all four of the firms. But they have many cases where they are attesting to values that of the exact same piece of paper where the numbers are widely different on both sides. Give any thoughts on that, Charlie? Well, it sure is. God made little green apples. This is going to cause a lot of trouble in due course. As long as it keeps expanding and ballooning and so on, and the convulsions are minor, it can just go on and on. But eventually there will be a big, a big denouement.",Buffett and Munger believe that derivatives increase leverage and can create chaotic situations with uncertain triggers. They also highlight the deficiencies in accounting standards and the potential for discrepancies in valuations.

If you had put $10,000 in 1965 into his company, Berkshire Hathaway, you would have one million today. Warren was a chapter in my 1972 book, Super Money, so I've known him a long time. He learned his trade with Ben Graham, the original Dean of Security Analysis at Columbia University. I don't think Warren has ever been on television until this interview, and he has certainly never courted publicity, but recently he got a lot of it when he emerged as the key figure in the takeover of ABC by Capital Cities. Warren will be the largest shareholder of the new company, and his own net worth is now far in excess of $500 million. But when I spoke with him last fall in his office in Omaha, he very characteristically made his investment style seem so perfectly simple. The first rule in investment is don't lose. And the second rule in investment is don't forget the first rule, and that's all the rules there are. I mean, if you buy things for far below what they're worth and you buy a group of them, you basically don't lose money. Warren, what do you consider the most important quality for an investment manager? It's the temperamental quality, not an intellectual quality. You don't need tons of IQ in this business. I mean, you have to have enough IQ to get from here to downtown Omaha, but you do not have to be able to play three-dimensional chess or be in the top leagues in terms of bridge playing or something of the sort. You need a stable personality. You need a temperament that neither derives great pleasure from being with the crowd or against the crowd, because this is not a business where you take polls. It's a business where you think. And Ben Graham would say that you're not right or wrong because a thousand people agree with you, and you're not right or wrong because a thousand people disagree with you. You're right because your facts and your reasoning are right. Warren, what do you do that's different than 90% of the money managers who are in the market? Certainly most of the professional investors focus on what the stock is likely to do in the next year or two. And they have all kinds of arcane methods of approaching that, but they do not really think of themselves as owning a piece of a business. But the real test of whether you're investing, from a value standpoint or not, is whether you care whether the stock market is open tomorrow. If you're making a good investment in a security, it shouldn't bother you if they close down the stock market for five years. All the ticker tells me is the price. And I can look at the price occasionally to see whether the price is outlandishly cheap or outlandishly high. But prices don't tell me anything about a business. Business figures themselves tell me something about a business, but the price of a stock doesn't tell me anything about a business. I would rather value a stock or a business first and not even know the price so that I'm not influenced by the price in establishing my valuation, and then look at the price later to see whether it's way out of line with what my value is. So Buffett chose to stay in this world, Omaha, Nebraska, where corn grows just minutes from downtown. Now Omaha is a nice town, but nobody claims it's a world financial center. And here the only thundering herd is actually on four feet. Don't you find Omaha a little bit off the beaten track for the investment world? Well, believe it or not, we get mail here and we get periodicals and we get all the facts needed to make decisions. And unlike Wall Street, you'll notice we don't have 50 people coming up and whispering in our ear that we should be doing this or that this afternoon. You appreciate the lack of stimulation here? I like the lack of stimulation. We get facts, not stimulation here. How can you stay away from Wall Street? Well, if I were on Wall Street, I'd probably be a lot poorer. You get overstimulated in Wall Street and you hear lots of things and you may shorten your focus. And a short focus is not conducive to long profits. And here I can just focus on what businesses are worth. And I don't need to be in Washington to figure out what the Washington Post newspaper is worth. And I don't need to be in New York to figure out what some other company is worth. It's an intellectual process. And the less static there is in that intellectual process, really the better off you are. What is the intellectual process? The intellectual process is defining your level, defining your area of competence in valuing businesses. And then within that area of competence, finding whatever sells at the cheapest price in relation to value. And there are all kinds of things I'm not competent to value. But there are a few that I am competent to value. Have you ever bought a technology company? No, I really haven't. In 30 years of investing, not one? I haven't understood any of them. So you haven't ever owned, for example, IBM? Never owned IBM. Marvelous company. I mean, it's a sensational company, but I haven't owned IBM. And so here is this technological revolution going on and you're not gonna be a participant. It's gone right past me. Is that all right with you? It's okay with me. I don't have to make money in every game. I mean, I don't know what cocoa beans are gonna do. There are all kinds of things I don't know about. And that may be too bad, but why should I know all about them? I haven't worked that hard on them. In securities business, you literally every day have thousands of the major American corporations offered you at a price and a price that changes daily. And you don't have to make any decisions. You have to make, nothing is forced upon you. So there are no called strikes in the business. The pitcher just stands there and throws balls at you. And if you're playing real baseball and it's between the knees and the shoulders, you either swing or you got a strike call on you. If you get too many call on you, you're out. In the securities business, you sit there and they throw US Steel at 25 and they throw General Motors at 68. You don't have to swing at any of them. They may be wonderful pitches to swing at, but if you don't know enough, you don't have to swing. And you can sit there and watch thousands of pitches. And finally you get one right there where you want it. Something that you understand and then you swing. So you might not swing for six months. You might not swing for two years. Isn't that boring? It would bore most people and certainly boredom is a problem with most professional money managers. If they try to sit out on anything or two, not only do they get somewhat antsy, but their clients are starting to start yelling, swing you bum from the stands. And that's very tough for people to do. Warren, your approach seems so simple. Why doesn't everybody do it? Well, I think partly because it is so simple. The academics, for example, focus on all kinds of variables. Partly because- By academics you mean professors of finance? Yeah, the data is there. In business school? Sure, and the data is there. So they focus on whether if you buy stocks on Tuesday and sell them on Friday, you're better off, or if you buy them in election years and sell them in other years, you're better off, or if you buy small companies. There are all these variables because the data are there. And they've learned how to manipulate data. And as a friend of mine says, to a man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail. Once you have these skills, you just are dying to utilize them in some way, but they aren't important. If I were being asked to participate in a business opportunity, would it make any difference to me whether I bought it on a Tuesday or a Saturday or an election year or something? It's not what a businessman thinks about in buying businesses. So why think about it when buying stocks? Because stocks are just pieces of businesses.",Warren Buffett prefers a simple approach to investing and focuses on valuing businesses to buy them when they are cheap.
126,https://youtu.be/8xIDhM366YM,8xIDhM366YM," When you were actively managing money, you presumably were under the same pressures as other fund managers to show performance results. Did that incline you to sell too quickly sometimes? Well, I think my greatest mistakes are probably, you know, it's funny in a stock, all you can lose is 100 percent, I've done that. And your great mistakes are selling a good company and it doubles, then it triples and quadruples because you make a lot of mistakes. And so it's ones that go up tenfold, I call them the ten baggers. So some of my mistakes are just saying, oh my God, this stock is too high and I was wrong. And you had to figure out what inning am I in this baseball game. I sold Toys R Us way too early. It went up twentyfold after I sold it. I did the same thing at Home Depot. Those are probably my two greatest mistakes I ever made. When should you sell? Well, you ought to find out why you bought a stock. If you're saying it's a sick little company and they're doing poorly and they're doing awful, you wait till things are getting better and they're doing terrific and then you sell it. But with a growth company, you have to say, in Wal-Mart's case, ten years after it went public, you could have bought the stock and made 500 times your money. Because they still are only in 15 percent of the United States. And they could say, why can't they go to 17? Why can't they go to 19? Why can't they go to 23? So for the next four decades, they're going around the country. So you have to say to yourself, in this stock, I have a ten-year story, a twenty-year story. I'll be able to write that down and follow that. That's what I do with the company. And that's your decision. That's how you sell it. We have a novel element from many investors today in the trust issue. We also have security problems that we didn't traditionally have in America. Have they changed the way you pick and believe in stocks? No, you still buy a company and you buy a company to grow. And if it's a textile company or it's an electronics company or a software company, you better understand what they do. And if they do well, the stock will do well. No matter what happens to the market. If the Dow Jones today was a thousand or five hundred, you would have made a lot of money in McDonald's. You would have made a lot of money in Johnson & Johnson. You would have made a lot of money in Gillette. These companies' earnings have gone up a lot the last 30 years. And if the market was 50,000, you would have lost money in Burlington Industries. I recommended that in 1969. I think it's gone from 34 to 2 with no stock splits. Because the earnings have been terrible. Well, your modesty actually makes an important point, which is people with the best batting averages in the world don't bat a thousand. I sometimes get angry mail, particularly to in bear markets, saying so-and-so recommended such-and-such and it went down. Well, how often did you come up with a clinker? Well, this is a funny business. You don't have to be right even five times out of ten. If the times you're right, you make a double and triple, it offsets all those times you lose 20 or 30%. So when you buy a stock, you've got to say to yourself, how much can I lose and how much can I make? And you ought to be able to make a lot. Stocks are risky. Look at how much we lost in AT&T. Look at how much we lost in Xerox. These were quality companies. You can lose a lot in a stock. So you've got to say to yourself, how much can I make? Because I want to buy a stock if I'm right, I'm going to make a double or triple. So does your own confidence ever get shaken? Every day I think the market's going to go up. I keep calling a lot of my companies. I keep calling the companies.","The interview discusses mistakes in stock trading, when to sell a stock, understanding the companies behind the stocks, risks of investing, and balancing potential profits with potential losses.Lynch emphasizes the importance of understanding the company's business, regardless of market conditions. He highlights that successful stock picking doesn't require a perfect track record, as even a few successful picks can offset losses. Lynch also mentions his confidence in the market's upward movement and his ongoing evaluation of companies."
127,https://youtu.be/9gc60zmsA4I,9gc60zmsA4I," My name is Jeff Bingham. I'm from Chicago, Illinois. I have a question regarding the manufactured housing industry. What is your outlook on demand for the industry and correspondingly in your opinion will lending increase in a meaningful way over the next few years and are the homes priced attractively relative to competitive products like stick-built housing and apartments in the face of continued site rent increases at the community level and in some cases lenders requiring shorter maturities on mortgages? It's kind of an interesting history on manufactured housing. You go back, you have to go back 30 or 40 years, 40 years I think almost, to have fine volume as low as it's been in the last couple of years and the houses are better than, by far better than they were then. There have been years when 20% of the housing, the new housing product in the United States was manufactured housing, one out of every five. Last year leaving out FEMA demand, you know, we were bumping along for the third year I believe, just a tiny bit over the 130,000 level, you know, which is like six or seven percent, probably seven percent of new housing starts. So the percentage of the total new housing stock that has been manufactured housing in recent years has really been very low while the houses are better, considerably better quality than in the earlier years. You can look at the house, we got two houses out there on the exhibition floor, around $45 a square foot, you know, that's good value. There's a lot of resistance through local zoning laws and that sort of thing by the local builders to the influx of manufactured housing. We've made progress on that in some areas, we're actually developing subdivisions in that business. The houses were missold four or five years ago in huge quantity because you had manufactured housing retailers selling the properties, getting any kind of a down payment, taking the loans, selling to people that shouldn't be buying them, taking the loans, securitizing them, till somebody in some insurance company someplace or lost significant sums of money. So you had really an abuse of credit in the field and there's a hangover from that and it's taken a long time for that hangover to work its way through. I think Clayton Homes, which we own, has done a terrific job in both the financing. They should be financed on shorter terms, incidentally. If you put them on owned land, that's one thing, but financing them for 30 years in my view was a mistake. But the terms got very lax for a while and we're bearing the consequences of that now. But I think the market will get bigger, but I do not think it will get bigger this year. I see a year that counting some FEMA demand and some hurricane induced demand and maybe a hundred and fifty thousand units, a hundred and forty five thousand units, and by industry standards that's down a lot. Now the number of plants is down a lot and the number of retailers are down a lot. Clayton's position is very strong and their record is so much better than anybody in the industry that you have to look very hard to find number two. Charlie? Yeah, you asked about stick-built housing and how competitive it was. That's been one of the troubles of the manufactured housing game. Stick-built housing has gotten so efficient, but there the system is aided greatly by Berkshire's subsidiary MyTech. So, and stick-built housing is amazingly efficient when it's done in big quantity with systems like MyTech provides. And if it weren't for that there'd be a lot more manufactured housing. Personally I think manufactured housing is going to get a lot better and take a lot more of the market. It may take a considerable period but that is so logical that I think it will eventually happen. Yeah, somewhere down the road you would expect 200,000 plus units for the industry but I don't think you'll see it in the next next year or two. The industry has to think through and they have they made a lot of progress on this but they have to think through what's the logical way of financing these things and what's the way to make sure that the person who buys it really has an asset that's in excess of their loan value five and ten years down the road. And no and really very little consideration was given to that five years ago. It was just a question to put together the paper, sell it on Wall Street and let somebody else worry about it later on. Clayton did a way better job than other companies in that respect but those were the industry conditions that existed then. I think but I think Clayton will be, Clayton could easily be the largest homebuilder in the United States in future years because that we will be a big part of an industry that as Charlie says should be doing more volume. I also think that some of the sin that was in the manufactured housing finance a few years ago has shifted into the finance of the stick-built houses. There is a lot of ridiculous credit being extended in America in the housing field and it had a horrible aftermath in the manufactured housing sector and my guess is there'll be some trouble in the stick-built sector in due course. Well dumb, dumb lending always has its consequences and usually on a big scale because you don't see it for quite a while so therefore it's it's like a disease that doesn't manifest itself for you know a few weeks and and you can have an epidemic of something like that and by the time you know you have an epidemic you're you're very well into it. Well that's what happens in in dumb financing and you had that you periodically get up you certainly had it in commercial financing in the 80s and you had the RTC and the savings and loan crisis and all of that because literally one dumb project was put up after another. A developer will develop anything he can borrow the money against you know I mean that it's it's that simple and and when the when the lending institutions pour the money out for something it will get built and that happened in manufacturing housing it happened in commercial real estate in the 80s I think it's happened in in conventional housing here in recent years and if you look at the ten cues that are getting filed for the first quarter of some lending institutions and and and the 10 K's that were last year and you look at the the balance is increasing on loans for interest that's accrued but was not paid because people had adjustable mortgages but they were only adjustable so far but the lending institutions are taking in the income as if as if it were paid you'll see some very interesting statistics. Yes and some of this dumb lending is being facilitated by contemptible accounting the accounting profession has not stopped compromising its way into terrible behavior. Our auditing bill just went up Number twelve","Buffett and Munger discuss the low demand and financing issues in the manufactured housing industry. They predict demand will increase but not in the next year or two and warn against dumb lending. At one point, 20% of new housing in the United States was manufactured homes. However, recent years have seen a lower percentage, around 6-7% of new housing starts. There has been resistance from local builders due to various factors, including local zoning laws. The speaker anticipates an increase in the market size of manufactured housing, but not within the current year. "
128,https://youtu.be/aG0PxFtAWTo,aG0PxFtAWTo," My name is Simon Dennison-Smith from the UK. My question is this. If you were starting out today with a million dollars, with a vision of building a business with 20% average growth and value over 40 years, what type of investments and investment strategy would you look to make in the first five years? Well, it's somewhat interesting that we formed the first partnership 50 years ago, two days ago, Thursday, May 4th, 1956, which was 105,000. That's my sister clapping. She was in the partnership. The... We would... Charlie and I were starting all over again and we were in this. Charlie would say we shouldn't be doing this, but... If we were to succumb to Satan and engage in the same kind of activity, we would, I think, be doing something very similar. If we were investing in securities, we would look around the world, and we would look at a Korea, and Charlie says you can't find 20 of them, but you don't have to find 20 of them. You only have to find one, really. You do not have to have tons of good ideas in this business. You just have a good idea that's worth a ton, occasionally. And in securities, we would be doing the same thing, which would probably mean smaller stocks. It would mean smaller stocks, because we would find things that could have an impact on a small portfolio that will have no impact on a portfolio the size of Berkshire. If we were trying to buy businesses, we'd have a tough time. We would have no reputation, so people would not be coming to us. We'd be too small a player if you're talking about a million dollars. So we would not have much success, I don't think, with small amounts of buying businesses. Charlie started out, you know, in real estate development, because it took very, very little capital, and you could magnify brain power and energy, or I should say brain power and energy could magnify small amounts of capital in a huge way that was not true in securities. You know, my natural inclination was to look at securities and just kind of do it one foot in front of the other over time. But the basic principles wouldn't be different. You know, I think if I'd been running a partnership a couple of years ago with a small amount of money, I think I'd have probably been 100 percent in Korea. And, you know, I would be looking around for something that was very mispriced and that I understood. And every now and then that's going to happen. Charlie? Well, I agree with that. The concept that you're likely to find just one thing where it'll make 20 percent brand when you just sit back for the next 40 years, that tends to be dreamland. And in the real world, you have to find something that you can understand that's the best you have available. And once you found the best thing, then you measure everything against that because it's your opportunity cost. That's the way small sums of money should be invested. And the trick, of course, is getting enough expertise that your opportunity cost, meaning your default option, which is still pretty good, is very high. And so the game hasn't changed at all in terms of its basic arithmetic. That's why modern portfolio theory is so asinine. It really is, folks. Yeah. When Warren said he would have been all in one country, that's pretty close to right. He wouldn't have quite done that when he had the partnership, but he would have been way more concentrated than is conventional if you listen to modern portfolio theory. Most people aren't going to find thousands of things that are equally good. They're going to find a few things where one or two of them are way better than anything else they know. And the right way to think about investing is to act thinking about your best opportunity cost. By the way, that's in the freshman course in economics. Everywhere in the basic textbook, it just hasn't made its way into modern portfolio theory. We don't get asked to do book reviews. You",Buffett and Munger advise those starting a business with a million dollars to look for mispriced securities or smaller stocks with potential impact on a small portfolio. The key is to find a few things where one or two are way better than anything else and to measure everything against that as the opportunity cost.
129,https://youtu.be/biKr34fDb0E,biKr34fDb0E," You've praised the president's tax cut, calling it a wind at the American economy's back, I guess. No, I have said that it is a wind, a tax bill that was targeted in a big way to help corporations. So it helps Berkshire's million shareholders. It isn't what I would have done if I was going to have a tax cut. So as an individual, I do not agree with the philosophy that led to it. But as a steward at Berkshire Hathaway, I have to tell you that it does our shareholders a lot of good. I see. Because I was going to ask you, I mean, there must be a cost to this. There's always a cost. Right. I mean, and it sort of suggests that the savings from the government then, all that money was maybe misspent by the government. I mean, is there a cost, a downside to the tax cut? Well, there's always, I mean, let's just say- Trade-off. If you take taxes to zero for everything in the country, you would be issuing a lot of bonds. But you can't ever do just one thing in economics. You probably can't in physics either. There's a butterfly effect. But in economics, you always have to say, and then what? And if you give a large break to one group, it's not free. If I were going to cut the revenues of the United States, I would have helped a different group of people. But as I say, it is very helpful to Berkshire. It's not that we were non-competitive before, but our shareholders are better off. Don Harding, one of our readers, viewers, asks, so have you increased salaries and benefits for Berkshire employees like some other companies have done in the wake of the announcement about taxes? Yeah, some of our portfolio companies have done that. But we're not paying dividends. We're not repurchasing shares. We're investing. And we'll use the money for investment. I wonder, Warren, what you think of President Trump's tweets, particularly about the stock market. And one of our readers asks, Yuan Yi-Chin from San Mateo, how Warren Buffett would rate President Trump? Well, I'm not going to rate the presidents. But I would say that communication is enormously important for a president. Going back to Roosevelt, in the 1930s, every family in the country was sort of huddled around his radio. I mean, if you had the big networks, you were talking to everybody. And now it's much more diffused. And obviously, President Trump feels that he does not like it filtered through the traditional news media. So he's going to do it directly. I believe communication is enormously important for a CEO. And I like to talk to our shareholders directly. If I were frustrated with my ability to talk to the people I'm responsible for, I would try to figure out a way to do it directly. And obviously, the president feels that way. So can we talk a little bit about a health care initiative? Have you told the story about how that came about? Did Jamie call you up on a conference call with Jeff? How did it happen? I think probably, you know, I can't answer it with 100% precision. But my impression is that it came about because there's a fellow quite young that works for us, Todd Combs, also on JP Mortgage Board. And Todd and I have talked a lot about health care. And I think Todd developed some ideas about how something like this might work. And I think he's the one that actually talked to Jamie. And is this really just for these three companies? Or is it going to be a model for the rest of the health care system? What's the point? I hope if we can figure out a way to have better care at lower cost and stem the constant rise as a percentage of GDP, I hope every company in the United States steals the idea from us. And just to also want to touch on cryptocurrencies, I know that you've had some negative feelings about them. But now Wall Street institutions seem to be dipping their toes in. And I wonder, A, if you've changed your mind at all, and B, one of the biggest mysteries in America, what did you tell Katy Perry about cryptocurrencies? That's between me and Katy. I guess so. It's said that you guys talked about cryptocurrencies, but none of us know what you guys said. That's just between you two? We did. OK. I will answer your question. There's two kinds of items that people buy and think they're investing. One really is investing and the other isn't. If you buy something, a farm, an apartment house, or an interest in the business, and look to the asset itself to determine whether you've done something, what the farm produces, what the business earns, and so on, you don't really care what the stock market's open. You can do that on a private basis. In fact, you do it on a private basis if you buy a farm or apartment house generally. And it's a perfectly satisfactory investment. You look at the investment itself to deliver the return to you. Now if you buy something like Bitcoin or some cryptocurrency, you don't have anything that's producing it. You're just hoping the next guy pays more. When you only feel you'll find the next guy to pay more, if he thinks he's going to find somebody that's going to pay more. Now if you ban trading in farms, you could still buy farms and have a perfectly decent investment. If you ban trading in apartment houses or even in equities, if you ban trading in Berkshire Hathaway for the next five years, our investors would do fine over time. But if you ban trading in tulip bulbs or if you ban trading in some Bitcoin, which nobody knows exactly what it is, people would say, well, why in the world would I buy it? And you are investing when you do that. You're speculating. There's nothing wrong with it. If you want to gamble, somebody else will come along and pay you more money tomorrow. That's one kind of game. That is not investing. Interesting. I want to ask you some questions for the Chinese audience. First of all, can you say ni hao to them? Ni hao. All right. How much do you think the Chinese economy and markets will ultimately become like the United States? How much convergence do you think there will be? I really don't know the answer to that. What I do know is they have found the secret sauce for themselves, just like we found the secret sauce a couple of centuries ago. And so they have had an economy in the last 60 years or thereabouts. They have unleashed the potential of their citizenry. And where for really centuries they did not progress that much economically for an overwhelming portion of their population. What they've done in the last 50 or 60 years is a total economic miracle. I never would have thought it could have happened. But the truth is they're as smart as we are, they work as hard as we are, and they can have growth in the economy from a lower base that will exceed ours percentage-wise for a long time. And I mean, they're destined for a fine economic future just like we are. Shifting gears, Warren, I want to ask you about women in the workplace and the Me Too movement. What role can men play to advance women in their careers in business and in the economy? Well, I had and have two sisters that are absolutely smart as I am and better personalities. You'd like a better. They were born around my time of 1930. And they were told marry early and marry well. That was the unseen message. I mean, nobody ever said it that way. So I have seen half of the United States' talent basically put off to the side. And it's one of the things that makes me optimistic about America is when I look at what we accomplished using half our talent for a couple of centuries, and now I think of doubling the talent that effectively employed, at least has the chance to be, it makes me very optimistic about this country. And good managers are scarce. And it's always rare. And you better use every bit of it that you can find. Certainly the way I've felt personally all my life. Skip from Baltimore wants to know if you collect Social Security. I collect it. And my wife is now eligible and she's supposed to be collecting, but she hasn't gotten her check yet. But we'll see whether she should be getting it here pretty soon. Tasia from Columbus, Ohio asks, plenty of time left, Warren, but got to ask you, what do you want to be remembered for? As a teacher. That would be very flattering if I would feel that was on my tombstone, because I benefited from, terrifically from teachers, not all teachers who were employed as teachers, but teachings of all kinds, but people spending their time to pass along what they have learned. So a teacher, not a great investor. Yeah, well, I don't do anything in investing that, that's complicated. I've just been at it a long time. I mean, just look at it, if I just put that $114 in the S&P, I'd have $400,000. Well I think there's a little more to it than that. Scott from Papillion, Nebraska says, how do you tell the difference between reasonable and unreasonable fear? So in other words, a stock's down, maybe it should be down, or a stock's down, maybe it shouldn't be down. Well, you just keep looking at the facts. I mean, you're looking at a business, that's the important thing. You don't look at a stock chart. I looked at stock charts for years. I used to have a lot of fun doing that. I was kind of groping around for all the philosophy. You look at the business. I mean, how you decide, if you own a half interest with somebody of yours, and a McDonald's store, how do you decide whether it's a successful investment? Well, if the snow's two feet out and there's no business today, do you say, well, I made a terrible deal? No. You look at how it's performing as a business over time, how it's doing versus the competition. All right, Warren Buffett, thank you very much for all of your time. Great talking to you. OK, thanks for having me.","Warren Buffett discusses the economy, tax cuts, cryptocurrencies, and his desire to be remembered as a teacher in a CNBC interview."
130,https://youtu.be/AT16nCyf-VE,AT16nCyf-VE," Good afternoon Mr. Buffett, Mr. Munga. My name is Richard Azhar. I'm from Trinidad in the West Indies. You guys have been very generous with your intellect over the years and it's been a huge help to me in my personal and financial life. I weathered if it was appropriate for me to describe the methodology in which I'm trying to determine the range of Berkshire's intrinsic value and if you can guide me on if my mythology is flawed or is reasonably accurate. If it doesn't take too long, we'll be glad to. Although I think I know the answer already. Okay. We ended 2003 with about 5.422 billion of operating earnings. I estimated our look-through earnings to be approximately 915 million. So in total that was about 6.337 billion of look-through earnings. I knew that we spent a billion too on capex and our net depreciation on tangible assets was 829 million. So there was a difference there of 173 million and we spent more on capex over the appreciation over the last few years. But in extrapolating out 20 years, I thought I might be kidding myself to ascertaining the differences between capex and depreciation and I'm using look-through earnings as a rough proxy for distributable earnings. And I've assumed that Berkshire can grow its look-through earnings at 15% per annum from years 1 to 5 and at 10% per annum from years 6 to 20 and the business will stop growing after year 20 resulting in a 7% coupon from year 21 onwards. I discounted the cumulative flows in years 1 to 20 by 7% and I discounted the terminal value by 7%. I added the two together to get what I thought was the intrinsic value of Berkshire's cash stream. I knocked off 103 billion of liabilities and minority interest. I divided by 1,537,000 shares to arrive at what I thought was a conservative calculation of the range of Berkshire's intrinsic value. Am I off the mark or is that the sort of mythology you might use yourself? Well, you've done your homework. The line of thinking is correct. It just depends on what variables you plug in and we might have different ideas on variables and neither one of us knows. But the approach in general, the approach of trying to figure out distributable cash over a period of time, the business today is worth the present value at some number, you're using 7% but the question is what number to use, but it's worth the present value of all the cash it can distribute between now and judgment day and if cash can be retained at a rate higher, it produces at a rate higher than your discount rate obviously, you'll get some benefit from that retention. But I would say that your assumptions about CapEx and related depreciation, I would expect CapEx to be on average a little more than depreciation unless we run into highly inflationary times. But of course we have to keep buying businesses and using the capital in the business that we retain, if we retain those earnings we have to use that to buy more businesses and then the question is what kind of returns can we expect on those. I don't quarrel with the approach you're using but everybody has to do their own equation and plug in some numbers and I think we might settle for lower numbers on earnings gains than you've postulated because we're very large and it gets harder all the time to deploy the kind of funds that keep flowing into Omaha. Charlie? Yeah, you shouldn't necessarily get overly excited about last year, as Warren said, that is a very unusual year when everything worked together pretty darn well. Except interest rates. Yeah, well, but a lot worked together very well. The interesting thing about Berkshire's present valuation is how much cash and cash equivalents it has to do something and that is a very interesting question. How well are we going to do with this massive amount of investable cash and cash equivalents? We should be out working now. That is the test. I mean, we've got a bunch of good businesses. We've got a lot of money that we'd like to use to buy more good businesses. We may get lucky and deploy that quite rapidly. We may wait a long time. Cash may pile up faster than we can use it, in which case we'll have to rethink the whole game. But our hope is, and so far we feel okay about what's happened in that, our hope is that we can deploy the money that flows in in businesses that come close to being as good as the ones that we've bought over the years.","Buffett and Munger agree on using distributable cash to determine Berkshire Hathaway's intrinsic value, but variables may differ. Munger cautions against being overly excited about last year's earnings and highlights the challenge of deploying the company's large amount of investable cash.They estimated operating earnings of about $5.422 billion in 2003, with estimated look-through earnings of approximately $915 million, totaling around $6.337 billion. They calculated a difference of $173 million between capital expenditures (capex) and depreciation on tangible assets. They projected 15% annual growth in look-through earnings for years 1 to 5, and 10% annual growth for years 6 to 20, with 7% growth from year 21 onwards. They discounted these cash flows by 7% and subtracted $103 billion of liabilities and minority interests, arriving at an intrinsic value calculation. They divided this value by 1,537,000 shares. "
131,https://youtu.be/bIXPhjCquVY,bIXPhjCquVY," My name is Takashi Ito from Japan. In addition to the global excess liquidity, corporate profits are very high compared to the share of labor. Does that make it extra challenging for you to find investment opportunities? Thank you. Yes, corporate profits in the United States are, except for just a very few years of record in terms of GDP. I've been amazed that after being in a range between 4 and 6 percent of GDP, they have jumped upward. And you would not think this would be sustainable over time. Excuse me just one second. Charlie, you want to talk for a second? You've just heard him on the subject. But corporate profits, when they get up to 8 percent plus of GDP, that is very high. And so far it has caused no reaction. One reaction would be higher corporate taxes. You have lots and lots of businesses in this country earning 20 or 25 percent on tangible equity in a world where long-term bond rates are 4 and 3 quarters percent government bond rates. That's extraordinary. If you'd read an economics book 40 years ago and it talked about that kind of a situation persisting, well, you wouldn't have found a book like that. I mean, that does not make sense under pure economic theory. But it's been occurring for some time. And as a matter of fact, it's gotten more extreme. Corporate profits continue to rise as a percentage of GDP. That means somebody else's share of GDP is going down. And you're quite correct that the labor component of GDP has actually fallen fairly significantly. Whether that becomes a political issue, maybe in the next campaign, whether it becomes something that Congress does something about, Congress has the power to change that ratio very quickly. Corporate tax rates not that long ago were 52 percent and now they're 35 percent and a whole lot of companies get by with paying 20 percent or less. So I would say that at the moment, corporate America is kind of living in the best of all worlds. And history is showing that those conditions don't persist indefinitely. What brings it to an end when it happens, I don't know. But I would not expect corporate profits to be eight and a fraction percent of GDP on average in the future. Charlie? Yeah, of course, a lot of the profits are not in the manufacturing sector or the retailing sector either. A lot of them are in this financial sector. And so we've had a huge flow of profit to banks and investment banks and investment management groups of all kinds, including various kinds of private equity. And that has, I think, no precedent. I don't think it's ever been as extreme as it is now. Do you agree with that? Yeah, and Charlie and I would have said 20 years ago, we've done things in banking from time to time, including owning a bank. But if you'd said to us in a world of four and three quarters percent long-term governments, will one major bank after another be earning more than 20 percent on tangible equity, dealing in what is basically a commodity money, we would have said that that condition just wouldn't persist. Now, part of that is because the banks are geared up more. So if you earn one and a half percent on deposits, you know, and you have one and a half percent on assets and you have assets of 15 times equity, you're going to be earning 22 and a half percent on equity. And by gearing up more, it does improve the return on equity. But you still would think that would be self-neutralizing. You think that after one guy did it, another guy would do it. And instead of earning one and a half percent on assets, you'd earn, you know, nine tenths of a percent or one percent on assets. But it hasn't happened. That's gone on for a long time. And, you know, we are living at ��� I'd have to look at a chart on it, but there may have been a year or two post-World War II. But I don't think that ��� I would bet there haven't been more than two or three years in the last 75 when corporate profits as a percentage of GDP have been this high. Some of this has come from consumer credit, which I think has been pushed to extremes that we've never before seen in the history of this country. Some other countries that pushed consumer credit very hard had enormous collapses. Korea had one, for instance, that caused chaos for, what, two or three years? Maybe longer. So I don't think this is a time to just swing for the fences. And that chaos in 1997 and 1998 when the IMF stepped in ��� I mean, it was bad in Korea for a while. It produced some of the most ridiculously low stock prices that I've ever seen in my life. In fact, I mean, you could go back to 1932 in this country and you wouldn't have seen things any cheaper. And in the meantime, the companies rebuilt their balance sheets and their earning power. So things do turn around in financial markets. You will ��� if you're young enough, you will see everything and then some. I mentioned in the annual report in looking for an investment manager to succeed me that we care enormously about finding somebody who's not cognizant of everything risky that's already happened, but that also can envision things that have not yet been experienced. That's our job in the insurance business and it's our job in the investment business. And there are a lot of people that just don't seem to ��� they're not ��� they're very smart, but they just ��� they're just not wired to think about troubles that they haven't actually witnessed before. But, you know, that's the problem Noah had. You know, the first 40 days, it was tough sledding for Noam. He got revenge eventually.","Corporate profits in the US may not be sustainable and could lead to political or economic changes. There is also risk for investors due to the current state of financial markets and consumer credit. Being able to envision potential challenges and adapt to them is crucial.

132,https://youtu.be/bxWKpzgFlvE,bxWKpzgFlvE," You recently talked about bubbles and high valuations in your Sone Conference talk. Is Costco a part of that? Costco has never traded at a higher price to sales or price to earnings multiple. How should new investors think about Costco given its record run? Well, that's a very good question, and I've always believed that nothing was worth an infinite price. So at some, even an admirable place like Costco could get to a price where you would say that's too high. But I would argue that if I were investing money for some sovereign wealth fund or some pension fund, and I have 30, 40, 50 year time horizon, I would buy Costco at the current price. I think it's that strong an enterprise and that admirable a place. Now I'm not saying I would, I can't bring myself with my habits to pay these big prices, but I never even think about selling a share of Costco just because it's selling at a high price. So if you stop to think about it, I bought at Christmas time a flannel shirt, a bunch of flannel shirts at Costco. They cost $7 each more or less. It was a soft flannel and it was better and so forth. And then I bought pants, I think they were Orvis pants, and I paid like $7. They stretch around my waist and they're partly water resistant, what have you. Costco's going to be an absolute titan on the internet because they've got curated products that everybody trusts and huge purchasing power and a limited number of stocking units. So I'm not worried about, I'm not saying I'm buying Costco at this price, but I'm certainly not selling any. I think it's going to be a big, powerful company as long, as far ahead as you can see. And I think it deserves its success. I think it has a good culture and a good moral ethos. So I wish everything else in America is working as well as Costco does. Think what a blessing that would be for us all.","Buffett believes Costco is a strong company with admirable traits and would buy it for a long-term pension fund. He also expects Costco to become an online titan due to its curated products, trustworthiness, and purchasing power. Munger is optimistic about Costco's potential for success and praises its culture and moral ethos."
133,https://youtu.be/f9nhANMnF_o,f9nhANMnF_o," My name is Ted Friedman. I'm from Cincinnati, Ohio. You said in the 1996 annual report that most investors will find that the best way to own common stocks is in an index fund that charges minimal fees. Two questions. First, there are a lot of different index funds that hold different baskets of stocks. What criteria would you use or recommend to select an appropriate index fund? Second, the price to earnings ratio of the S&P 500 is significantly higher than its historical average. What benchmark should an investor use in purchasing this index? I would say that in terms of the index fund, I would just take a very broad index. I would take the S&P 500 as long as I wasn't putting all my money in at one time. If I were going to put money into an index fund in relatively equal amounts over a 20 or 30 year period, I would pick a fund. I know Vanguard has very low costs. I'm sure there are a whole bunch of others that do. I just haven't looked at the field. I would be very careful about the costs involved because all they're doing for you is buying that index. I think that the people who buy those index funds on average will get better results than the people that buy funds that have higher costs attached to them. It's just a matter of math. If you have a very high percentage of funds being institutionally managed, and a great many institutions charge a lot of money for doing it, and others charge a little, they're going to get very similar gross results but different net results. I recommend to all of you reading John Bogle's written a couple of books in the last five years. I can't give you the titles, but they're very good books. Anybody investing in funds should read those books before investing. If you've already invested, you still should read the books. It's all you need to know about fund investing. I would pick a broad index, but I wouldn't toss a chunk in at any one time. I would do it over a period of time. The very nature of index funds is that you are saying, I think America's business is going to do reasonably well over a long period of time, but I don't know enough to pick the winners, and I don't know enough to pick the winning times. There's nothing wrong with that. I don't know enough to pick the winning times. Occasionally I think I know enough to pick a winner, but not very often. I certainly can't pick winners by going down through the whole list and saying this is a winner and this isn't, and so on. The important thing to do if you have an overall feeling that business is a reasonable place to have your money over a long period of time is to invest over a long period of time and not make any bet implicitly by putting a big chunk in at a given time. As to the criteria as to when you should or shouldn't, I don't think there are any great criteria on that. I don't think price earnings ratio determines things. I don't think price book ratios, price sales ratios, I don't think any... There's no single metric I can give you or that anyone else can give you in my view that will tell you this is a great time to buy stocks or not to buy stocks or anything of the sort. It just isn't that easy. That's why you go to an index fund and that's why you buy over a period of time. It isn't that easy. You can't get it by reading a magazine. You can't get it by watching television. You'd love to have something that said, you know, if PEs are 12 or below or some number you buy and if they're 25 or above you sell. It doesn't work that way. It's a more complex business than that. It couldn't be that easy when you think about it. So if you are buying an index fund, you are protecting yourself against the fact that you don't know the answers to those questions, but that you think you can do well over time without knowing the answers to those questions as long as you consciously recognize that fact. And, you know, I would... If you're a young person and you intend to save a portion of your income over time, I just say just pick out a very broad index and I would probably use the S&P 500 because I think if you start getting beyond that, you start starting to think you should be in small caps this time and large caps that time or this foreign side. And as soon as you do that, you know, you're in a game you don't know. You know, you're not equipped to play in all candor. That would be my recommendation. Charlie? I think his second worry is that common stocks could become so high priced that if you bought index funds, you wouldn't expect to do very well. I didn't think I'd live long enough to think that was likely to happen, but now I think that may happen. But probably what you're saying there is that they could get to a level and be... They'd have to be at a sustained level like that for a long time. They could be there and stay there for a long time. In which case you might make 3 or 4 percent. But would there be anything way better than that around under those circumstances anyway? And pass the paint brittle, please. Well, in Japan where something like this happened, the return from owning a nice index over the last 13 years or so is negative. Can something as horrible as that happen here? I mean, is it conceivable? I think the answer is yes. But the option in Japan, of course, is to have deposits in a bank or own Japanese bonds at somewhere between 0 and 1 or 1.5 percent. So if rates on everything get very low, which means stocks sell very high, then it just means that you live in a different world than existed 20 or 30 years ago when generally capital got paid better. Thank you.","Buffett recommends investing in a low-cost index fund like the S&P 500 over a long period. He does not believe in a single metric to determine when to buy or sell stocks, and prices can remain high for an extended period. He emphasizes the importance of low costs in index funds and suggests reading John Bogle's books on fund investing. Buffett believes that timing the market based on metrics like price-to-earnings ratio (P/E), price-to-book ratio, or price-to-sales ratio is not effective, and that investing over time in a broad index fund is a prudent approach.

134,https://youtu.be/gqMT-bYoPm4,gqMT-bYoPm4," Good morning. I'm Thomas Kamei from San Francisco. I'm 17 years old and this is my 10th consecutive annual meeting. Must be a PhD by now at least. Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger, I'm curious about what you think is the best way to become a better investor. Should I get an MBA, get more war experience, read more Charlie Munger almanacs or merely is it genetic and out of my hands? Well I think you should read everything you can. I can tell you in my own case I think by the time I was, well I know by the time I was 10 I'd read every book in the Almanac Public Library that had anything to do with investing and many of them I'd read twice. So I don't think there's anything like reading and not just as limited to investing at all but you just got to fill up your mind with various competing thoughts and sort them out as to what really makes sense over time. And then once you've done a lot of that I think you have to jump in the water because investing on paper and doing, you know, and investing with real money, you know, is like the difference between reading a romance novel and doing something else. So I would, there is nothing like actually having a little experience in investing and you soon find out whether you like it. If you like it, if it turns you on, you know, you're probably going to do well on it. And the earlier you start the better in terms of reading. But, you know, I read a book at age 19 that formed my framework for thinking about investments ever since. I mean what I am doing today at 76 is running things through the same thought pattern that I got from a book I read when I was 19. And I read all the other books too but if you, and you have to read a lot of them to know which ones really do jump out at you and which ideas jump out at you over time. So I would say that read and then on a small scale in a way that can't hurt you financially do some of it yourself. Charlie? Well Sandy Gottesman who is a Berkshire director runs a large and successful investment operation. And you can tell what he thinks causes people to learn to be good investors by noticing his employment practices. When a young man comes to Sandy he asks a very simple question. No matter how young the man is he says, what do you own and why do you own it? And if you haven't been interested enough in the subject to have that involvement already why he'd rather you go somewhere else. It's very, that whole idea that you own a business is vital to the investment process. If you were going to buy a farm you'd say I'm buying this 160 acre farm because I expect that the farm will produce 120 bushels an acre of corn or 45 bushels an acre of soybeans and I can buy the fur. You know you go through the whole process. It'd be a quantitative decision and it would be based on pretty solid stuff. It would not be based on what you saw on television that day. It would not be based on what your neighbor said to you or anything of the sort. It's the same thing with stocks. I used to always recommend to my students that they take a yellow pad like this and if they're buying 100 shares of General Motors at 30 and General Motors has whatever it has out 600 million shares. Or a little less that they say I'm going to buy the General Motors company for $18 billion and here's why. And if they can't write a good essay on that subject they've got no business buying 100 shares or 10 shares or one share at $30 per share because they are not subjecting it to business tests. And to get in the habit of thinking that way you know Sandy would have followed it up with the questions based on how you answered the first two questions that made you defend exactly why you thought that business was cheap at the price at which you were buying it. And any other answer you'd flunk. Thank you.","Buffett and Munger recommend reading widely and gaining investing experience to become better investors, with Munger emphasizing the importance of understanding the businesses being invested in.Charlie Munger adds that understanding ownership of a business is vital, comparing it to buying a farm based on quantitative analysis. He also emphasizes the need for prospective investors to thoroughly analyze their investment decisions. The paragraph contains insights into the value of reading, practical experience, and business understanding in becoming a successful investor."
135,https://youtu.be/GVtaKKn43M8,GVtaKKn43M8," Hi, I'm Dave Staples from Hanover, New Hampshire, and I've got two questions for you. First, I'd like to hear your thoughts on selling securities short and what your experience has been recently and over the course of your career. The second question I'd like to ask is how you go about building a position in a security you've identified. Using USG as a recent example, I believe you've bought most of your shares at between $14 and $15 a share. But certainly you must have thought it was a reasonable investment at $18 or $19. Why was $14 and $15 the magic number? And now that it's dropped to around $12, do you continue to build your position? How do you decide what your ultimate position is going to be? Well, we can't talk about any specific security. Our buying techniques depend very much on the kind of security we're dealing in. Sometimes it's a security that might take many, many months to acquire, and other times you can do it very quickly, and sometimes it may pay to pay up, and other times it doesn't. And sure as you never know exactly what the right technique is to use as you're doing it, but you just use your best judgment based on past purchases. But we can't discuss any specific one. Short something is an interesting item to study because it's ruined a lot of people. It is the sort of thing that you can go broke doing. Bob Wilson, there's famous stories about him in resorts internationally. He didn't go broke doing it. In fact, he's done very well subsequently. But being short something where your loss is unlimited is quite different than being long something that you've already paid for. And it's tempting. You see way more stocks that are dramatically overvalued in your career than you will see stocks that are dramatically undervalued. It's the nature of securities markets to occasionally promote various things to the sky so that securities will frequently sell for five or ten times what they're worth, and they will sell themselves for 20% or 10% of what they're worth. Therefore you see these much greater discrepancies between price and value on the overvaluation side. So you might think it's easier to make money on short selling. And all I can say is it hasn't been for me. I don't think it's been for Charlie. It is a very, very tough business because of the fact that you face unlimited losses and because of the fact that people that have overvalued stocks, very overvalued stocks, are frequently on some scale between promoter and crook. And that's why they get there. And they also know how to use that very valuation to bootstrap value into the business because if you have a stock that's selling at 100 that's worth 10, obviously it's to your interest to go out and issue a whole lot of shares. And if you do that, when you get all through the value can be 50. In fact there's a lot of chain letter type stock promotions that are sort of based on the implicit assumption that the management will keep doing that. And if they do it once and build up to 50 by issuing a lot of shares at 100 when it's worth 10, now the value is 50 and people say, well these guys are so good at that, let's pay 200 for it or 300 and then they can do it again and so on. It's not usually quite that clear in their minds, but that's the basic principle underlying a lot of stock promotions. And if you get caught up in one of those that is successful, you can run out of money before the promoter runs out of ideas. In the end they almost always work. I would say that of the things that we have felt like shorting over the years, the batting average is very high in terms of eventual, they would work out very well eventually if you held them through. It is very painful and in my experience it was a whole lot easier to make money on the long side. I had one situation, actually an arbitrage situation when I was in, well it was when I moved to New York in 1954, so it was about June or July of 1954, that involved a surefire type transaction, an arbitrage transaction that had to work. There was a technical wrinkle in it and I was short something. And I felt like, for a short period of time, I felt like Finova was failing last fall. I mean it was very unpleasant. You can't make, in my view, you can't make really big money doing it because you can't expose yourself to the loss that would be there if you did do it on a big scale. And Charlie, how about you? Well, Ben Franklin said if you want to be miserable during Easter or something like that, he says borrow a lot of money, you'll be repaid at Lent or something to that effect. Similarly, being short something, which keeps going up because somebody is promoting it in a half-crooked way and you keep losing and they call on you for more margin, it just isn't worth it to have that much irritation in your life. It isn't that hard to make money somewhere else with less irritation. It would never work on a Berkshire scale anyway. You could never do it for the kind of money that would be necessary to do it with in order to have a real effect on Berkshire's overall value. So it's not something we think about. It's interesting though. I've got a copy of the New York Times from the day of the Northern Pacific Corner and that was a case where two opposing people each owned over 50% of the Northern Pacific Company, Northern Pacific Railroad. And when two people each own over 50% of something, you know, it's going to be interesting. And Northern Pacific on that day went from $170,000 to $1,000 and it was selling for cash because you had to actually have the certificates that day rather than the normal settlement date. And on the front page of the New York Times, which incidentally sold for a penny in those days, it's had a little more inflation than Coca-Cola, front page of the New York Times right next to the story about it, it told about a brewer in Newark, New Jersey who had gotten a margin call that day because of this and he jumped into a bat of hot beer and died. And that's really never appealed to me as the ending of a financial career. And who knows? You know, when they had a corner in Piggly Wiggly, they had a corner in Auburn Motors in the 1920s. I mean, there were corners. That was part of the game back when it was played in a kind of a footloose manner. And it did not pay to be short. Actually, during that period, you might find it interesting. In the current issue of the New Yorker, maybe one issue ago, the one that has an interesting story about Ted Turner, there's also a story about Hedy Green. And Hedy Green was one of the original incorporators of Hathaway manufacturing, half of our Berkshire Hathaway operation back in the 1880s. And Hedy Green was just piling up money. She was the richest woman in the, maybe in the world, certainly in the United States, maybe some queen was richer abroad. But Hedy Green just made it by the slow old-fashioned way. I doubt if Hedy was ever short anything. So as a spiritual descendant of Hedy Green, we're going to stay away from shorts at Berkshire.",Buffett and Munger advise against short selling due to the unpredictable nature of overvalued securities declining and the potential for unlimited losses. They prioritize pursuing profitable investments instead of focusing on failed short positions.

He helped turn it into the largest mutual fund company in the world. The Vanguard 500 index that Bogle started and created in 1975 was the first low-cost index mutual fund designed for the average investor. Jack, named by Fortune magazine, as one of the four giants of the 20th century in the investment industry. He is also the best-selling author of 10 books on his life in investing. He will talk to us about his new book as well. Jack Bogle is with us this weekend and it is good to see you, Jack. Thanks so much for joining us. My pleasure, Maria, always. So much to talk about with you and let me start off with some news of the week. And of course, this week we learned that household wealth reached a milestone, Jack. $100 trillion. Americans wealth surpassed the $100 trillion mark for the first time early this year, which is an incredible number. And of course, that has to do with stock investing. It also has to do with the price of their homes. Jack Bogle, you are the pioneer in this business. What has changed since you started Vanguard? Oh, I guess I'd start by saying everything has changed, Maria. One, the mutual fund industry is a totally different business. It's now probably 70% of the cash flow, sometimes 100% of the cash flow is going into index funds, which didn't even exist when I started Vanguard all those years ago. And indexing is up to, I think, around 45% of equity mutual fund assets. So it's been a revolution, indexing has, and it's changed the nature of how people look at investing. And most important of all, Maria, it's made people start to think about cost. Cost is everything in this business. Because when you think about it, where are returns generated for we investors? They're generated by corporate America. They earn money, they pay dividends, they reinvest the remainder in the business, and that's where value is created. The financial markets are the way we access that value. But the financial markets don't give us all of it. They take their share first, and then give us what's left, us being we investors. So anytime you can find a way to do that, you can do it. Shorten that gap, bridge that gap, minimize that gap is a good thing for the American investor. Yeah, you make a great point about cost, because people were not focused on that until you put it front and center with such low fees at Vanguard. And now you've got industry after industry trying to copy Vanguard, and whether it's the ETF industry, the index industry, or even just brokers trying to take their fees down. Is this a race to the bottom, Jack, in terms of how low fees have gone? Well, that's really a great question, Maria, because most of the fee competition, in truth, is in the ETF, exchange traded fund area, because that's where a lot of the activity is, that's where a lot of the cash flow is. And the competition is moderate for actively managed funds, and really very, very light for what I call traditional index funds, TES, index funds, TIFs, I should say, index funds of the type I started back in 1975, that are bought and held together forever. And let me explain it this way. We've changed the business, the indexing business, from an index, passive index, held by passive investors, to passive indexes held by active investors. A lot of trading goes on in ETF land, and that's not such a good thing. So that's where the competition is, because you can make money starting a little company, I call them financial buccaneers, trying to find a little hole that nobody else has filled, a little niche, if you will. And there's not much appetite in the traditional index fund business for lower cost, because, as I say, I've often said, the problem with index funds is all the darn money goes to the investors. And the mutual fund business is a business that is people come into the fund business to make money for themselves in their management companies. They want to make money for their investors, sure, but the more the management company takes, the less the investor makes. And that's the issue, and a lot of people don't recognize that. That's why the first question is, how much is it costing you? Because the money is coming out of your returns. Jack, how do you answer the criticism, when I saw your interview with Barron's recently, about the critics of the index fund today, saying that you're not allocating capital properly. It's because the biggest stocks make up the biggest percentage of most of the indexes, like Microsoft, just 3.2% of the S&P 500, while Walmart is half a percent. So new money going into the index fund means that these already large stocks take up proportionally more money than other stocks. So is that destabilizing? That's not only not destabilizing, Maria, it's not true. In other words, if we have 4% of assets in Alphabet or Google, we put 4% of our new money into that. If we have half a percent in Walmart, as you said, we put half a percent in our new money. It doesn't change the equation. We're investing based on the market values of the company. And when the prices of those companies go up, the prices go up in the regular market, if you will, by individual investors, but they also go up for the index fund. So rising prices creates zero, zero capital allocation issues.","Jack Bogle, founder of Vanguard Group, highlights the benefits of indexing in the mutual fund industry and the importance of minimizing costs. He addresses criticisms of index funds and dismisses concerns that rising prices create capital allocation issues.The Vanguard Group, founded by Jack Bogle in 1974, became the world's largest mutual fund company. The Vanguard 500 Index, launched in 1975, was the first low-cost index mutual fund for average investors. Indexing now represents around 45% of equity mutual fund assets, and index funds receive approximately 70-100% of cash flow. ETF competition focuses on fee reduction, particularly in the exchange-traded fund (ETF) sector. The criticism that large stocks in indexes receive more new money than others is countered by Bogle, who asserts that investments are based on market values, and rising prices benefit both individual investors and index funds."

Is that something that people can do look at someone like yourself and see your path? I mean you're in real estate law then investing What do you even consider yourself a businessman? How would you describe what you do? Well, I Don't consider myself. I Think my way of thinking will work for anybody of trying to be very rational and disciplined So I think that much But to flit around the various careers and go into the other fellows professional territory and trying outdo him and do all kinds Of things like that. I think will not work for most people and So I always tell I'm always being visited by young men who say I I'm practicing law and I don't like it. I'd rather be a billionaire. How can I do it and I tell them? Well, I'll tell you a story The young man goes to see Mozart and he says Mozart I want to start composing symphonies and Mozart said how old are you and the guy says 22 and he says you're too Young to do symphonies and the guy says yes, but you were 10 years old when you were composing symphonies and Mozart says yes But I wasn't running around asking other people how to do it right So I think this flitting around business is something not everybody should try Yeah, I think if I tried it again, it might not have worked as well You said just figure out I may have been somebody doing why were you were lucky? Yeah. Yeah, I think I had some luck. Yes well, but I Think there's more to it than that. I mean where were you? Yes the combination of luck and skill. That's what all good records are",The speaker suggests that his way of thinking will work for anybody who wants to be rational and disciplined. He also acknowledges the role of luck and skill in being successful.
138,https://youtu.be/jM5RAiaOm1I,jM5RAiaOm1I," So, again, 22-year-olds who are coming out of college, very competitive environment out there, but many want work-life balance. Many are looking for more than just working the 80, 90, sometimes 100 hours. Is it possible to be successful and yet have this desire? I think it's absolutely possible. I think, first of all, working a couple of years at that pace is not the end of the world as long as it leads to something better. When I was graduating business school, there was huge peer pressure to go to an investment bank, that the goal of every single person in my class, class of 82 at HBS, seemed to be working for Goldman Sachs. When I looked around, I had those interviews to see what everybody else was so excited about, and you looked at the partners. I thought there was huge information there, that the partners were basically 100% male, almost 100% divorced, almost 100% fat, and almost 100% bald. That didn't seem like something to give away your best 10 or 15 years, and then you'd be so lucky as to join that group. When I had the opportunity, with a very uncertain plan of a startup firm that I didn't own any of, to see what it would become and whether it would be successful, I nevertheless chose it, partly because I was excited to stay in Boston and not get caught up in the rat race in New York. I also thought, I'm good at certain things. Competing 100 hours a week won't be one of them, because there will always be someone else that can do 110 hours, but being recognized for what the things I can bring to the table are in terms of a certain investment perspective, a certain discipline, a certain risk aversion that maybe other people didn't have would be a good thing. All I would say is, try to hold out. If you have to work for a couple of years to get the next offer or to get into business school, fine, but remember, your goal is not to be working 100 hours a week. Your goal is to get into a situation that recognizes you for who you are. If you ever are going to work that hard, try and have it be on your own nickel. Try to be an entrepreneur, and at least you're doing it for you, not for somebody else. You can hold you better accountable than you can hold a boss accountable. If you do work that hard, at least the rewards will also go to you. If you can, be an entrepreneur, especially if you're going to work that hard.",Speaker suggests that one can achieve success while maintaining a work-life balance and advises considering entrepreneurship as a means to work hard and reap the rewards for oneself.
139,https://youtu.be/JRNp-bg_5jU,JRNp-bg_5jU," The minimum wage debate is front and center right now. Should the federal minimum wage in this country be raised? I don't think a modest raise in the minimum wage will have any terrible consequences on the economy. I'm all for a small raise. What's that number? 7.5 million? I don't want to specify, but I think a high minimum wage that makes lots of people unemployable I think is a stupid policy. But I think as long as the minimum wage is kept moderate, it should be jockeyed up every few years. Is 10.10 an hour, as President Obama is pushing for, is that too high? Does that mean job losses? I think the country could easily stand 10.10 an hour. You do? Yes. I sat down a few weeks ago with Warren Buffett and asked him the same question. He said that is one of the hardest questions and I've been thinking about it for 50 years. I don't know if the minimum wage should be raised. He's probably right that if I were picking it, I might pick a different number because I'm naturally conservative. But I don't think it would ruin the republic if the minimum wage is 10 dollars an hour. And you don't think there would be significant job losses as a result? I think there would be some job losses, absolutely. That's what's wrong with the whole idea. The second job I got paid 40 cents an hour and that was the minimum wage. So I have been paid a minimum wage in my own lifetime. And that, by the way, I don't think it was worth any more. The issue is when you're trying to raise a family on minimum wage, right? That's where you run into this fight over what a living wage is in this country. Yes, but if you have the idea that everybody requires a decent standard of living, meaning the average standard of living, the whole economy would go into paralysis. So it would be a mistake to try and make the average wage you want for the country the minimum wage. That would make the whole system malfunction. The minimum wage has to be a pretty low figure. But I don't think it didn't ruin me or the country when they created a minimum wage for Charlie Munger of 40 cents an hour. And that was 1939.","Speaker supports moderate raise of minimum wage every few years, but not a high minimum wage that would make people unemployable. Believes $10.10/hr is manageable, but job losses may occur. Not in favor of making the average wage the minimum wage as it could harm the economy.The current minimum wage is mentioned as $10, with acknowledgment of potential job losses at that level. The historical context of minimum wage, including the speaker's experience of being paid 40 cents an hour in 1939, is also discussed. "
140,https://youtu.be/k2VSSNECLTQ,k2VSSNECLTQ," The worst day on Wall Street since the crash of 1987 The down traders are standing there watching in amazement and I don't blame them We're now down 43% Almost everything there completely wiped out and the Nasdaq everything and more has been completely wiped out Let's talk about the speed with which we are watching this market deteriorate Can I get you to speak a little to him? Yeah, one billion, two billion, three billion You can imagine the American economy is an economic train moving down a track that has no ending And it picks up cargo and passengers as we go along There's 330 million of us now and there are only 4 million in 1790 And our farms are incredibly more productive And we have 75 million houses and we had a few huts then We have great universities and all of these things So we're just constantly moving more and more cargo and passengers along And occasionally that train is going to get derailed In 2008 you had something close to a bubble in home real estate 50 million people had mortgages roughly at that time out of 75 million homeowners When that bubble burst it hit home to probably 40% of the households in the country These people that had mortgages on their houses And fear spread in the month of September 2008 at a rate that was like a tsunami Who do you hold responsible for that? Bubbles are always hard to ascertain the originators of There really aren't any originators Everybody got caught in some, some were foolish, some were crooked, some were both But you had a mass illusion that it could go on forever You had Wall Street firms participating, you had mortgage originators participating But you had the public participating It was a lot of fun, it was like Cinderella going to the party It was all going to turn to ice and pumpkins at midnight But nobody wanted to leave until one minute to midnight And the rush for the door couldn't be handled What for you were the lessons you learned from 2008? I didn't really learn any new lessons in 2008 or 2009 I had emphasized to me some of the things that I'd always believed That you do need somebody who can say, well, do whatever it takes The U.S. government had to do the right things Not perfect things, but generally the right things starting in September And they did a fantastic job actually of getting the train back on the tracks There was still damage for a long period thereafter But it was really important to have fast action at that time And we were very fortunate we had the leaders we did If we'd had people who waited for all the information to be right Or for committees to work or that sort of thing, it would have been far, far worse People talk about a fog of war, but there's a fog of panic too And during that panic, you're getting inaccurate information, you're hearing rumors If you wait until you know everything, it's too late What are the consequences of the crisis? People today, 10 years later, they're still affected by the crisis Various people in different ways, but they're not as affected as they were in 2009 or 2010 Has that confidence come back? Yeah, but it comes back slowly I can understand why people that lost their houses or lost their jobs Or whatever may have happened to them feel that there must be somebody out there That was profiting from this that did it doing some things that should send them to jail The people that ran most of the institutions, the big institutions That got in trouble, probably shouldn't name names They went away rich They may have been disgraced to some degree, but they went away rich I don't think the incentive system has been improved a lot from what it was 10 years ago What are the consequences of the crisis? If I knew what the next crisis would look like, I could probably It might be a little bit helpful in stopping it, but there will be other crises There's no way of knowing when you're in a situation like we were in in the fall of 2008 or 2009 When or precisely how it will end You know the United States will come back The factories don't disappear, the farmland doesn't disappear, the skills of the people don't disappear But you had a system which was going to put them all in an idle position or could do it And there's no way of knowing how far it was going to go What's left from the crisis is pretty much your memories The tracks are still there, the train is still there, but we had a big interruption in 2008 or 2009 And now the train has been running pretty darn well And we've shown that America can't be stopped","Warren Buffett discusses the 2008 financial crisis and its consequences, highlighting the need for government action and the lack of improvement in the incentive system.  The crisis involved a bubble in home real estate affecting around 40 percent of households, and the fear spread rapidly like a tsunami in September 2008. The responsibility for the crisis is shared among various parties, including Wall Street firms, mortgage originators, and the public. The US government's fast and generally correct actions played a crucial role in stabilizing the situation. The confidence in the economy has slowly returned over time, and while some institutions' leaders faced disgrace, they still profited. The crisis left lasting memories, but America's resilience and recovery were evident as the economy rebounded."
141,https://youtu.be/KmQk4zkrdzU,KmQk4zkrdzU," Hi, I'm Bob Klein from Los Angeles. Pursuing your earlier comments on sigmas from a different angle, the conventional wisdom in the investment world is that an investment's risk can be measured by the volatility of the price of the investment in the marketplace. To me, this approach has it backwards since changes in price are determined by the changes in the opinions of investors in the marketplace. Why would a rational investor substitute the opinions of the marketplace as reflected in the volatility of the price for his own assessment of the risk of the investment? And consultants take this idea further by tracking the volatility of a portfolio manager's results in an attempt to measure risk. So could you guys expand on your thoughts on this? Yes, volatility does not measure risk. And the problem is that the people who have written and taught about volatility do not know how to measure, or have been taught about risk, do not know how to measure risk. And the nice thing about beta, which is a measure of volatility, is that it's nice and mathematical and wrong in terms of measuring risk. It's a measure of volatility, but past volatility does not determine the risk of investing. I mean, actually take it with farmland here. In 1980, or in the early 1980s, farms that sold for $2,000 an acre went to $600 an acre. I bought one of them when the banking and farm crash took place. And the beta of farms shot way up. And according to standard economic theory, market theory, I was buying a much more risky asset at $600 an acre than the same farm was at $2,000 an acre. Now people, because farmland doesn't trade often and prices don't get recorded, you know, they would regard that as nonsense that it might purchase at $600 an acre of the same farm that sold for $2,000 an acre a few years ago was riskier. But in stocks, because the prices jiggle around every minute and because it lets the people who teach finance use the mathematics they've learned, they have in effect, they would explain this away a little more technically, but they have in effect translated volatility into all kinds of past volatility in terms of all kinds of measures of risk. And it's nonsense. Risk comes from the nature of certain kinds of businesses. It can be risky to be in some businesses just by the simple economics of the type of business you're in. And it comes from not knowing what you're doing. And you know, if you understand the economics of the business in which you are engaged and you know the people with whom you're doing business and you know the price you pay and is sensible, you don't run any real risk. And I don't think Charlie and I, certainly Berkshire, I don't think we've ever had a permanent loss in marketable securities that was what, 1% maybe, half a percent of net worth. I made a terrible mistake in buying Dexter shoe which cost us a significantly more than 1% of net worth where I bought an entire business then. But I was wrong about the business. It had nothing to do with the volatility of shoe prices or leather or anything else. Just was wrong. But in terms of marketable securities, I cannot recall a case where we've lost that kind of thing. We've done a lot of things in securities that had a very high beta. We've done a lot of things in securities that had a low beta. It's just the whole development of volatility as a measure of risk. It's really occurred in my And it's been very useful for people who wanted a career in teaching but it is not, we've never found a way for it to be useful to us. Charlie? Well it's been amazing that both corporate finance and investment management courses as taught in the major universities, we would argue it's at least 50% twaddle. And yet these people have very high IQs. One of the reasons we've been able to do pretty well is that we early recognized that very smart people do very dumb things and we tried to figure out why. And we also wanted to know who so we could avoid them. We will not run big risks at Berkshire. Now we will be willing to lose, as I put in the annual report, $6 billion in a given catastrophe. But our catastrophe business, run over many years, is not risky. A roulette wheel will occasionally pay off at 35 to 1. That sounds like you're paying out an awful lot of money compared to the amount bet on one number. But I would love to own a lot of roulette wheels.",Risk in investment cannot be measured solely by the volatility of the price in the marketplace. It also comes from the nature of certain businesses and the lack of knowledge in investing.
142,https://youtu.be/Ky_876v9GsU,Ky_876v9GsU," Mr. Buffett, my name is Hutch Vernon. I'm from Baltimore, Maryland. I know that you read lots and lots of annual reports, and I'm curious what you are reading for, if you would share that with us. But I'm more curious because I think I know what you're reading for. If there are any disclosures, any further disclosures that you would like to see companies make in their financial reporting or that the SEC require in financial reporting or other communications with their shareholders. And that would be for both you and for Mr. Munger. The main thing that they can't mandate in annual reports, I really like to know as much as I can about the person that's running it and how they think about the business and what's really going on in the business. In other words, I would like to have a report that would be identical to what if I owned half of a company but was away for a year and I had a partner who owned the other half, when I came back that he would tell me about what had taken place during the past year and what he foresaw coming up and all of that. That is what I think the purpose of the report is. Now the SEC mandates a lot of information and some of that is helpful. But there's an intent behind the report. I mean if it's a sales document, I'm less interested and I don't see any way to mandate what I'm talking about. But that's the kind of report I'm looking for. What I'm trying to do is I read reports. A, I like to understand just generally what's going on in all kinds of businesses. If we own stock in a company in an industry and there are eight other companies that are in the same industry, I want to own or be on the mailing list for the reports for the other eight because I can't understand how my company is doing unless I understand what the other eight are doing. I want to have the perspective in terms of market share or what's going on in the business or their margins or the trend of margins or all kinds of things that I can't get unless I know. I can't be an intelligent owner of a business unless I know what all the other businesses in that industry are doing. So I try to get that information out of a report. If I'm thinking about investing in a specific company, I try to size up their business and the people that are running it. Over the years, I found reading a lot of reports to be quite useful in terms of making sure business decisions at Berkshire. If we own all of a business, I want to own shares in all of the competitors just to keep track of what's going on. I want to be able to intelligently evaluate how our managers are doing that. I can't do that unless I know the industry backdrop against which they're working. It's amazing how well you can do in investing really with what I would call outside information. I find inside information, I'm not sure how useful that is, but outside information, there's all kinds of information around as to businesses. You don't have to understand all of them. You just have to understand the ones that you're thinking about getting in. You can do it if you just... Nobody will do it for you. You can't read, in my view, you can't read Wall Street reports and get anything out of them. You have to do it yourself and get your arms around it. I don't think we've ever gotten an idea in 40 years from a Wall Street report, but we've gotten a lot of ideas from annual reports. Charlie? What I find is that it takes a long time to read the annual report, even if it's a comparatively simple business. If you really are trying to understand it, it's not a bit easy. Yeah, I would say that on average in a business we're really interested in, even though we know what to skip to some extent, what to read. It's going to be 45 minutes or an hour on a report, and if there are six or eight companies in the industry, that's going to be six or eight hours perhaps, and then there are quarterlies and a lot of other. The way you learn about businesses is by absorbing information about them, thinking and deciding what counts and what doesn't count, relating one thing to another. That's the job. You can't get that by looking at a bunch of little numbers on a chart bobbing up and down, or reading market commentary and periodicals or anything of the sort. That just won't do it. You've got to understand the businesses. That's where it all begins and ends.","Buffett and Munger stress the importance of reading annual reports to understand a business and evaluate its decisions. They prioritize reports that offer insight into the business itself and its leadership, rather than sales documents."
143,https://youtu.be/l1dI3dpSMzM,l1dI3dpSMzM," My name is Ethan Berg. I'm from Cambridge, Massachusetts, and I'd like to thank you for the education you've provided, particularly with the annual reports. I've got three brief questions. Years ago, you wrote to your friend, Jory Orins, that you were applying to Columbia's Business School because they had a pretty good finance department and a couple of hot shots in Graham and Dodd. If you were considering graduate or business school today, with which individuals or professors would you want to study? Second question is a friend who wants to know your thoughts on the concrete, cement, and aggregates business. And the third question is from my wife. You mentioned earlier if someone were buying a parachute, they wouldn't buy based on lowest bid. We saw you towing around in a car this week that were to be bought today could probably be bought at a relatively low bid. As someone interested in your health, she's wondering whether you've considered a newer automobile, possibly one with lots of airbags. Actually, I picked out the car I have based on the fact that it had airbags on both sides. So that was a factor. It may have been the first car of its type ever made with airbags. But I think my car actually, it's both heavy and has airbags, and those are two primary factors in safety. I don't think any, I don't think a safer car is necessarily being made. It might be safer to drive around in a big heavy duty truck or something, but I'm not ready for that. The incident on a car, I look at that like anything else. It would take me probably a half a day to go through the exercise of buying a car and reading the owner's manual and all that. And that's just a half a day I don't want to give up in my life for no benefit. If I could write a check in 30 seconds and be in the same position I'm in now with a newer car, I'd be glad to do it this afternoon. But I don't like to trade away when there's really no benefit to me at all. I'm totally happy with the car. I just don't want to trade away the amount of time I'd have to spend fooling around to get familiar with and get titled to and do all the rest of the things, pick one out, so a new car. But if there's a safer car made, I'll be driving in it. The aggregates business, concrete, all of that, those are businesses that Charlie probably knows more about than I do. We've looked at businesses like that. In fact, we've even owned a few shares at one time or another because it's an understandable business. And it's a business that, particularly if you get into concrete cement, there have been periods of substantial overcapacity, particularly on a regional basis. But those are fundamental businesses. And at a price for low cost capacity and advantageously located raw materials and so on, we would do it. In fact, Charlie and I talked about one probably 10 or 15 years ago, quite a bit. And he's had a fair amount of familiarity with it. And what was the other one? I jotted it down here. Let's see. He wanted to know what business school. Oh, business schools, yeah. Well, I would say this, that I think Bruce Greenwald's class at Columbia is very good. He gets in a lot of people that are practitioners, so there's a lot of practicality to the course. And I think Bruce is good. He's got a new book coming out that probably within the next six months or so that we'll deal with that. And then there also has been a endowed at the University of Florida certain courses relating to value investing. And I think there's been one at the University of Missouri. So I would suggest you at least check out the curriculum at the University of Missouri and Columbia and Florida and do a little comparison and maybe check with a few graduates, recent graduates, as to what kind of experience they had. I think if you can find them, I think that's the best system for evaluating a place. But those three at least have courses that based on the catalog sound like they might be of interest to you. Charlie? Yeah. A huge majority of the business school teaching on the field of investment of passive portfolios of securities is not what we believe and not what Warren was taught years ago by Ben Graham. They're just little pockets of our attitude left. There's one at Stanford, Jack McDonald. Yeah, sure. And yeah, that's graduate school. It's graduate school. And what's interesting about that is I think it's the most popular course in the whole Stanford Business School. They've got some kind of a bidding system. And yet I asked Jack how he felt and he said he felt lonely. It's got the most popular course, but in the whole professoriate dealing with investment matters, the Jack McDonalds are a little clan of their own in a side pocket, so to speak. Now they're right. And I think it can take whatever consolation they get from that. But mostly if you go to a business school, you will learn a lot of things we don't believe. Jack, Bob Kirby comes in and works with Jack sometimes too. And Bob has got a terrific mind in terms of investment. So I mean, there's no question about that. It's not the easiest school in the world to get into and it is at the graduate level. But there are these occasional little anomalies, as they would say, in the teaching world. I mean, what you really want a course on investing to be is how to value a business. That's what the game is about. I mean, if you don't know how to value a business, you don't know how to value a stock. And if you look at what is being taught, I think you see very little of how to value a business. And the rest of it is playing around maybe with numbers or Greek symbols or something of the sort. But it doesn't do you any good. I mean, in the end, you have to decide whether you're going to value a business at $400 million or $600 million or $800 million. And then you compare that with the price. And that's what investing is. And I don't know any other kind of investing, you know, basically to do. That just isn't taught. And the reason that it isn't taught is because there aren't teachers around who know how to teach it. I mean, they don't know themselves. And since they don't know themselves, they teach something that says nobody knows anything, which is the efficient market theory. And if I didn't know how to do it, if I ever teach physics, I'm going to come up with a theory that nobody knows anything because it's the only way I can get through the day, you know. But it's fascinating to me how the really great universities operate in this respect. If you get a sacred writ, I mean, you get in the finance department because you sign on, you know, to whatever the present group thinks. And if they think the world is flat, you better think the world is flat too. And your students better answer that the world's flat when they get on exams. I would say investment finance teaching in this country is, in general, is kind of pathetic. Well, I think the business schools do a pretty good job when it comes to accounting or personnel management or there are a whole lot of subjects, I think, they do quite well with. But they miss one enormous opportunity. If you learn to think intelligently about how to invest successfully in businesses, you'll become a much better business manager than you will if you... aren't good at understanding what's required for successful investment. So they're missing a huge opportunity to improve the management profession by doing such a lousy job in teaching investment. Yes, see, Charlie and I see CEOs all the time who, in a sense, don't know how to think about the value of businesses they're acquiring. And then, you know, so they go out and hire investment bankers. And guess what? The investment banker tells them what to do... tells them to do it because they get 20 X if they do it and X if they don't do it. And guess how the advice comes out. So it's... when a manager of a business feels helpless, which you won't say out loud, but inwardly feels helpless in the question of asset allocation, you know, you've got a real problem. And there aren't... they have not gone to business schools that have given them any real help, I think, in terms of learning how to think about valuation and businesses. And, you know, that's one of the reasons that we write and talk about it some, because it's... there's a gap there.",Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger expressed concerns about the lack of emphasis on understanding how to value a business in business schools and investment education. They also discussed their perspective on the aggregates business and Buffett's choice of car for safety.
144,https://youtu.be/LdUggq1W5rg,LdUggq1W5rg," Norman Rennthropp from Bonn Germany. Two thanks and one question. My thanks go to both of you for allowing us investors to participate on equal terms with you. No management fees, no performance fees, no transaction fees. My thanks also go to the people of Omaha for building this very fine new convention center. Our thanks too. I'll interrupt you for just one second. We wouldn't be able to hold this meeting if we'd been limited to the facilities we had last year. Last year we had the biggest facility in town and I was told that we have at least 19,500 people here and that would have been many, many thousands beyond what we could have had last year. And this facility really does the job. Incidentally, it's known as the Quest Center. If you read about it in the paper, they seem to have some unwritten rule, or maybe it's a written rule, that they can't use the name. So you will not see that name in the paper for reasons that absolutely baffle me. But this is the Quest Center and they've done a wonderful job with it and Omaha has 19,500 people here today that otherwise might have to go to Kansas City. So thank you for thanking them. And now your question, please. My question is your outlook on buying companies. You have taught us when stocks are priced high and companies are priced low, then buy companies. In the 1960s and 70s, we did see the rise of the conglomerates, then came in the pure industry plays. Now we see a huge amount of money in private equity. And somehow private equity is competing for buying companies. So my question is, what is your outlook on the future of the buyout and the buying company industry? You're absolutely correct that the private equity funds are a form of competition with Berkshire and buying businesses. We don't really seek to buy businesses cheap because you're not going to get the chance to do that. We haven't been able to do that. We do get occasional chances to buy them at what we would regard as fair value. You'll never buy companies as cheap as stocks sometimes get. I mean, sometimes stocks sell for very low intrinsic value. Businesses just don't do it. I mean, the reason is that the prices of stocks like those junk bonds we talked about earlier are set in an auction market. And that market can do extreme things, but businesses are sold in a negotiated transaction, and that doesn't get as extreme. Nevertheless, our preference, our strong preference, is that we would rather buy businesses at fair prices than stocks even a little cheaper. And the private equity funds are competition. On the other hand, we have bought a reasonable number of businesses in recent years, and we'll buy more in the future. If somebody wants what we are offering, you know, we are somewhat one of a kind in that we will buy a business, and the people that sold it to us if they built that business are really able to run it as if it's their own indefinitely in the future. So if they have a tax reason, if they have a family situation or whatever where they want to sell some business they love, and they don't want to auction it off like a piece of meat, and they don't want some guy buying it and then leveraging it up and then reselling it a couple years after changing the accounting or something of the sort, they come to us, and they know they'll get the result they want. And that happens periodically. It doesn't enable us to buy super bargains or anything like that. It just doesn't work that way. But it does let us put the money to work at a sensible rate. There will be more people like that. Unfortunately, we need big businesses, and they don't come home every day. But as I've said, if you find that kind of an owner, if I owned a business that was big and maybe my father had started, my grandfather had started, and I'd worked a long time for, but for one reason or another I had to monetize it, I would sell to Berkshire. It's very simple, because I wouldn't regard the carving up of it to get perhaps the highest, a higher price, which might or might not be higher, but I wouldn't regard that as the ultimate goal in life. I think it's kind of crazy to spend, I think it'd be kind of silly to auction off your daughter to whatever man is willing to pay the most for. And I feel the same way about a business you've created lovingly over decades and decades and decades. And we will buy some more. It's a matter of luck whether it happens in any given quarter or even any given year. But there's really no one else can quite make the promises that we can make. I mean, the degree of ownership that I have in Berkshire and the way I've got it set up for the future where none has to be sold, my promises will probably be about as good as you can get in that arena. Most big companies simply can't do that if their board of directors decides they want to have a pure play, as you put it in something. What can be done about it? I tell prospective sellers basically I'm the only one that can double-cross you. And I can double-cross them. I mean, if I the next day want to pull something out of my, it's not contractual what I've said to them, and I'll probably, but nobody else can. We're not going to get some management consultants in and say they say you ought to rearrange the business or we're not going to get Wall Street dictating to us. And that's, I think, a significant advantage over time. I think it will enable us to buy businesses, but we do have a lot of competition, as you point out. Charlie? Yeah, it's been interesting, though, that we've had this private equity competition for a long time, and one way or another we've managed to buy a few things.",The speaker discusses competition from private equity firms in business acquisitions and states that Berkshire Hathaway prefers to buy businesses at fair prices rather than super bargains. They also emphasize the advantage of Berkshire Hathaway in promising continued independence of acquired businesses.

They also discussed a book written by Buffett's cousin about their grandfather's grocery store."
146,https://youtu.be/N6Gj2hkjeX0,N6Gj2hkjeX0," A very good morning to Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger. My name is Rajesh Vora from Bombay, India. I have been learning a lot from annual letters of yours. It's been a great insight into investment philosophy that I haven't learned from anywhere else. Great job. That's on the mind side, but on the heart side, what touches me the most is what you have achieved all these years is through 100% honesty. And I salute to that. Thanks. My question is on what key steps would you recommend to correct the mindset of typical investor like me, which is what you narrate as lemmings-like, the crowd mindset? What would we recommend? We've got the question being repeated here. About the mindset of an investor? He wants you to advise him as to how he can become less like a lemming. Well since you repeated the question, I'm going to let you give the first answer to that, Charlie. Until he eats about a thousand calories a day. He wants to invest less like a lemming. Oh, I understand that. I was giving you the first shot at it. Well I will tell you what changed my own life on investing. I started investing when I was 11. I first started reading about it. I believe in reading everything in sight. And first started reading about it when I was probably six or seven years old. But for about eight years I wandered around with technical analysis and doing all kinds of things. And then I read a book called The Intelligent Investor. And I did that when I was 19 down at the University of Nebraska. And I would say that if you absorb the lessons of The Intelligent Investor, mainly, and I wrote a foreword and I recommended particularly chapters eight and 20, that you will not behave like a lemming. And you may do very well compared to the lemmings. We have here in the bookworm copies of The Intelligent Investor. And I think it's as great a book now as I did when I read it early, I guess in 1950. You can't get a bad result if you follow the lessons of Ben Graham taught in that book. I should mention that there's a book out there also that I did not know it would be completed by this time. My cousin Bill Buffett has written a book about our grandfather's grocery store called Foods You Will Enjoy. And Bill will be out there. He's signing books. I just got my first copy a couple of days ago. Ren and I enjoyed it a lot. Charlie worked at the same grocery store. How many years ago? Probably a good 70 years ago, in Charlie's case. Neither one of us was very good. But my grandfather, you don't want to pay much attention to his advice on stocks. He wrote a lot of letters and he was very negative on the stock market and big on hard work at the grocery store. So we quit listening to him. Instead, read The Intelligent Investor. That's the book that gave me a philosophy that has taken me now for a lot of years. And there's three big lessons in there which relate to your attitude towards stocks generally, which is that you think of them as parts of a business and your attitude toward the market, which is that you use it to serve you and not to instruct you, and then the idea of a margin of safety of always leaving some extra room in things. But the people in this room, I think, have learned that important first lesson. I mean, I think most people that own Berkshire do not see themselves as owning something with a little ticker symbol or something that may have a favorable or unfavorable learning surprise or something of the sort. But they rather think of themselves as owning a group of those businesses that are out there in the other room. And that's the way to look at stocks. You'll never be a lemming if you do that. Let's go to number two.","Lloyd Blankfein, former CEO of Goldman Sachs, discusses his current activities and mentions reading and trading in the markets. He also talks about potential government service or consulting work."
147,https://youtu.be/oJOBc7erM-k,oJOBc7erM-k," For 12 and a half years, you held what was arguably the most powerful job on Wall Street. What's it like now being the former CEO of Goldman Sachs? Bit of a relief. I'm not sure it was the most powerful. I spent a lot of time arguing against that, and I always thought to myself, gee, if I'm so powerful, how come I'm taking so much abuse? How are you keeping busy? Well, here we are chatting. Somehow I'm not scheduled. I don't set my clock most mornings. And somehow I get to the end of the day, and I've been busy the whole day. I spend a lot of time reading. I try to learn stuff. You know, originally I thought, and I wouldn't preclude going back and doing something else more intense, certainly, than the life I'm leaving now. I originally thought and was advised to take a gap year, and then when I finished my gap year, the country decided to go on its own gap year, one-year-plus gap year. So those consecutive gap years leave me in this place. I'd say the longer you're not setting your clock in the morning, the less you want to set the clock in the morning. But after 40 years of running around the world and living in the macro markets and knowing the price of everything all the time and knowing that anything that could go wrong anywhere in the world would affect us and have a huge consequence for us, it's a little bit hard to drop it. And there are parts of it that I never thought I'd miss, but I do miss. What are those things? What do you miss? Well, I miss the���you know, even sometimes, even as I say, I feel a little bit of relief in not having someone being intense, but I miss that. I miss the background noise, even of having things to fret about all the time. Is there such a thing as a substitute for that? Well, I'm sure there's a lot of people who work at great organizations and have quite fulfilled lies and give their all, and they're not at Goldman Sachs. So there's a lot of other things that one could do. If you were asking me, have I found a passion away from the commercial���I'm a commercial person, and so I'm involved in some philanthropy stuff, and I've elevated my involvement in some things in this period, and I enjoy that. And you could be quite commercial in those places, too. You can be a commercial person in government in the sense of getting things done and taking risk and pushing things along, and you could be that way in a philanthropy. But I'm a P&L guy, and I kind of like that stuff, and I like the immediacy of it, and I like the intensity of it. Your four predecessors as chairman of the firm���Hank Paulson, John Corzine, Steve Friedman, Bob Rubin���all went on to serve in government. They'll leave out John Whitehead. Well, there was one in between, right? John Weinberg. It was the same time as���yes. Why not you? Well, I would say among the many reasons, I haven't been asked, so that would be one of the prominent reasons. It's a little bit of a charged environment. I wouldn't say when you look at the administration, you're finding a lot of people from finance and business backgrounds, even in traditional roles in which they were occupied by financial people or commercial people or business people. So I would say that it's not something that I mourn, but certainly I would have gone into���I would have considered public service because what else is left? I worked at a high level at Goldman Sachs for 37 years. You want to do something different and make a contribution, so it's something that I might have, but I'm not mourning it. I understand why it's not happening now. I hear Janet Yellen is looking for an exit. What about Lloyd Blankfein for Treasury Secretary? Would you throw your hat into the ring if you thought they were interested? Who offered that job would decline that? I mean, you'd have to be preparing for your end of life or jumping off a cliff or something like that. Of course, that would be���to make that kind of a contribution or to be at that fulcrum of that very large lever, of course you'd want to do it. But again, I have no real connection to that. I mean, we can go through this, but I don't think that that's going to happen. But it's not going to happen because I'm going to turn down the crown three times and make them twist my arm. I don't think the offer is forthcoming. You dabbled for a hot second with consulting. Tell me about that. I was a���I think I was trusted by a number of people who came to me for advice, and guess what? They still did. And for a while���and you know, the line between you do things as long as I did and engage the people that I engaged with, there's not much separation between your business life and your personal life. And so I found myself in a position of, again, rendering life, rendering advice, nothing���not necessarily official. And then that started to morph where some things started to take a lot of time, and I toyed with the idea of doing it on a commercial basis. For money. For money. You know, nothing wrong with that. But again, I wasn't at the stage of life where I really wanted to get on a horse with a sample case and try to build that business. So you're not going to be a consultant. You're probably not going to be Treasury Secretary. I think I'm probably not going to be a surgeon at this point or a nuclear scientist. But you're 67. You swim every day. You're in good health. What's next? I don't worry about it. I don't worry about it. I'm not���look, I'm also a markets guy. I have been. I'm saying that's not how necessarily I lived the last 20 years of my career at Goldman, but it's an occupational hazard that I know the price of everything at times. And so I occupy myself with markets in the background. In the last couple of years, I trade a lot. Do you? I do. In your personal account? I do. If I do something differently, forget I said this and wipe out the tape. I didn't really want to look at people and be managing their money and express regret because God forbid you should lose money. But God forbid, a lesser included God forbid is that you underperformed somebody else who made more money or be on that kind of track. And I'm saying, do I really need to do that now? And so I do my own stuff for myself. I would much rather have lost my money than lose somebody else's money. And so that's just the way���that's just my wiring. What are you trading? I trade equities. I've traded some commodities. I've traded currency from time to time.","Investor psychology, not mathematics, influences the stock market, and Wall Street forecasts are no more accurate than a coin toss. It  provides insight into the post-retirement activities and thoughts of former Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein. He reflects on his 12.5-year tenure as CEO, discussing the relief and challenges of no longer holding the powerful position, keeping busy by reading and learning, considering gap years, missing the intensity and background noise of his former role, discussing potential substitutes for that feeling, exploring philanthropy and government involvement, mentioning predecessors who went into government, addressing the possibility of public service, and mentioning his engagement in consulting and personal trading in equities, commodities, and currencies.

148,https://youtu.be/OPNfbB_fhNE,OPNfbB_fhNE," Dean Courtney Brown and Professor Benjamin Graham were instructing future brokers and customers men. The explanation cannot be found in any mathematics, but it has to be found in investor psychology. You can have an extraordinary difference in the price level merely because not only speculators but investors themselves are looking at the situation through rose-colored glasses rather than dark blue glasses. It may well be true that the underlying psychology of the American people has not changed so much and that what the American people have been waiting for for many years has been an excuse for going back to the speculative attitudes which used to characterize them from time to time. If history counts for anything, that the stock market is much more likely than not to advance to a point where a real danger. This question concerns the so-called Wall Street professional. Are Wall Street professionals usually more accurate in their near or long-term market trends, forecasts of stock market trends? If not, why not? Well, we've been following that interesting question for a generation or more and I must say frankly that our studies indicate that you have your choice between tossing coins and taking the consensus of expert opinion and the results are just about the same in each case. Your question as to why they are not more dependable is a very good one and an interesting one. My own explanation for that is this, that everybody in Wall Street is so smart that their brilliance offsets each other and that whatever they know is already reflected in the level of stock prices pretty much and consequently what happens in the future represents what they don't know.","Buffett and Munger discuss investing a small sum of money, with Buffett saying he would use his current approach but with a larger universe of ideas. Munger criticizes the current investing scene as being too obsessed with chasing easy money."
149,https://youtu.be/rgyYFQmdRyY,rgyYFQmdRyY," I'm Michael Zenga from Danvers, Massachusetts. That's the town whose band Mr. Buffett so generously sent to the Rose Bowl Parade last year. So you're a very popular guy in my town. Good morning, Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger. Mr. Buffett, I wanted to ask you this question last week when I ran into you after Gillette's annual meeting, but I choked. So now that there's no pressure, here goes. In the years from my reading, in the years from 1956 through 69, you achieved the best results of your career quantitatively, 29% annually against only 7% for the Dow. Your approach then was different than now. You looked for lots of undervalued stocks with less attention to competitive advantage or favorable economics and sold them rather quickly. As your capital base grew, you switched your approach to buying undervalued excellent companies with favorable long-term economics. My question is, if you were investing a small sum today, which approach would you use? Well, I would use the approach that I think I'm using now of trying to search out businesses that where I think they're selling at the lowest price relative to the discounted cash they would produce in the future. But if I were working with a small amount of money, the universe would be huge compared to the universe of possible ideas I work with now. You mentioned that 56 to 69 was the best period. Actually, my best period was before that. Was from right after I met Ben Graham in early 1951, but from the end of 1950 through the next 10 years, actually returns averaged about 50% a year. And I think they were 37 points better than the Dow per year, something like that. But I was working with a tiny, tiny, tiny amount of money. So I would pour through volumes of businesses and I would find one or two that I could put $10,000 into or $15,000 into that were just ridiculously cheap. And obviously, as the money increased, the universe of possible ideas started shrinking dramatically. The times were also better for doing it in that time. But I think that, I think if you're working with a small amount of money with exactly the same background that Charlie and I have and same ideas, same whatever ability we have, I think you can make very significant sums. But as soon as you start getting the money up into the millions, many millions, the curve on expectable results falls off just dramatically. But that's the nature of it. You've got, when you get up to things you could put millions of dollars into, you've got a lot of competition looking at that and they're not looking as I did when I started. When I started, I went through the pages of the manuals, page by page. I mean, I probably went through 20,000 pages in the Moody's Industrial Transportation Banks and Finance manuals. And I did it twice. And I actually looked at every business. I didn't look very hard at some. Well, that's not a practical way to invest tens or hundreds of millions of dollars. So I would say if you're working with a small sum of money that, and you're really interested in the business and willing to do the work, you will find something if you were, there's no question about it in my mind. You will find some things that promise very large returns compared to what we will be able to deliver with large sums of money. Charlie? Well, yeah, I think that's right. A brilliant man who can't get any money from other people and is working with a very small sum probably should work in very obscure stocks, searching out unusual, mispriced opportunities. But, you know, you could, that's such a small world. It may be a way for one person to come up, but it's a long slog. Yeah, most smart people, unfortunately, in Wall Street figure that they can make a lot more money a lot easier just by one way or another, you know, getting an override on other people's money or delivering services in some way that people, and the monetization of hope and greed, you know, is a way to make a huge amount of money. And right now it's very, just take hedge funds. I mean, I've had calls from a couple of friends in the last month that don't know anything about investing money, they've been unsuccessful, and everything else, and, you know, one of them called me the other day and said, well, I'm forming a small hedge fund, 125 million, he was talking about, like the thought that since it was only 125 million, maybe we ought to put in 10 million or something, I mean, if you looked at this fellow's schedule D on his 1040 for the last 20 years, you know, you'd think he ought to be mowing lawns, but he may get his 125 million. I mean, you know, it's just astounding to me how willing people are during a bull market just to toss money around, because they, you know, they think it's easy. And of course, that's what they felt about it. Anderson and Stocks a few years ago, they'll think about something else next year too, but, the biggest money made, you know, in Wall Street in recent years, has not been made by great performance, but it's been made by great promotion, basically. Charlie, do you have anything? Well, I would state it even more strongly. I think the current scene is obscene. I think there's too much mania, there's too much chasing after easy money. There's too much misleading sales material about investments. There's too much on the television emphasizing speculation in stocks.",Buffett acknowledges the potential benefits of investing excess cash in an index fund but notes the potential execution problems for Berkshire. He emphasizes the importance of prioritizing the long-term interests of shareholders and avoiding permanent losses of capital.
150,https://youtu.be/sb5j4SzKzjI,sb5j4SzKzjI," Warren, you are a big advocate of index investing and of not trying to time the market. But by your having Berkshire hold such a large amount of cash and t-bills, it seems to me you don't practice what you preach. I'm thinking that a good alternative would be for you to invest most of Berkshire's excess cash in a well-diversified index fund until you find an attractive acquisition or buyback stock. Had you done that over the past 15 years, all the time keeping the 20 billion dollar cash cushion you want, I estimate that at the end of 2018, the company's 112 billion balance in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments in t-bills would have instead been worth about 155 billion. The difference between the two figures is an opportunity cost equal to more than 12 percent of Berkshire's current book value. What is your response to what I say? And for I forgot to say the question is from Mike Elzhar who is with the Colony Group located in Boca Raton, Florida. That's a perfectly decent question and I wouldn't quarrel with the numbers. And I would say that that is an alternative, for example, that my successor may wish to employ because on balance I would rather own an index fund than carry treasury bills. I would say that if we'd instituted that policy in 2007 or 2008, we might have been in a different position in terms of our ability to move late in 2008 or 2009. So it has certain execution problems with hundreds of billions of dollars than it does if you were having a similar policy with a billion or two billion or something of the sort. But it's a perfectly rational observation and certainly looking back on 10 years of a bull market it really jumps out at you. But I would argue that if you were working smaller numbers it would make a lot of sense and if you're working with large numbers it might well make sense in the future at Berkshire to operate that way. You know, we committed 10 billion a week ago and there are conditions under which, and they're not remote, they're not likely in any given week or month or year, but there are conditions under which we could spend a hundred billion dollars very, very quickly. And if we did, if those conditions existed, the capital would be very well deployed and much better than in an index fund. So we've been, we're operating on the basis that we will get chances to deploy capital. They will come in clumps in all likelihood and they will come when other people don't want to allocate capital. Charlie, what do you think about it? Well, I played guilty to being a little more conservative with the cash than other people. But I think that's all right. We could have put all the money into a lot of securities that would have done better than the S&P with 2020 hindsight. Remember we had all that extra cash all that period if something could come along in the way of opportunities and so on. I don't think it's a sin to be a little strong on cash when you're as big a company as we are. We don't have to, I watched Harvard use the last ounce of their cash, including all their prepaid tuition from the parents, and plunge it into the market at exactly the wrong moment and make a lot of forward commitments to private equity. And they suffered like two or three years of absolute agony. We don't want to be like Harvard. Plus timber and all a bunch of that. What? Plus timber and I mean- Yeah, yeah, we're not going to change. We do like having a lot of money to be able to operate very fast and very big. And maybe we know we won't get those opportunities frequently. I don't think, certainly, you know, in the next 20 or 30 years there'll be two or three times when it'll be raining gold and all you have to do is go outside. But we don't know when they will happen. And we have a lot of money to commit. And I would say that if you told me I had to either carry short-term treasury bills or have index funds and just let that money be invested in American generally, I would take the index funds. But we still have hopes. And the one thing you should very definitely understand about Berkshire is that we run the business in a way that we think is consistent with serving shareholders who have virtually all of their net worth in Berkshire. I happen to be in that position myself, but I would do it that way under any circumstances. We have a lot of people who trust us and who really have disproportionate amounts of Berkshire compared to their net worth if you were to follow standard investment procedures. And we want to make money for everybody, but we want to make very, very sure that we don't lose permanently money for anybody that buys our stock somewhere around intrinsic business value to begin with. We just have an aversion to having a million-plus shareholders, maybe as many as two million, and having a lot of them ever really lose money if they're willing to stay with us for a while. And we know how people behave when the world generally is upset. And they want to be with something. I think they want to be with something that they feel is like the rocker to brawler. And we have a real disposition toward that group.","Buffett and Munger advise against using options or leaps and investing in indices due to the increased risk of losing money through leverage. They suggest focusing on valuing businesses and being content with current investments.Buffett acknowledges the potential opportunity cost of not investing excess cash in an index fund, which could have yielded greater returns over a 15-year period, estimating a difference of more than 12 percent of Berkshire's book value. However, they emphasize the importance of having cash for swift and substantial deployment in strategic opportunities, especially given the size of Berkshire Hathaway. "
151,https://youtu.be/SMkpou-YBGw,SMkpou-YBGw," My name is Stanley Watkins from Manhattan, Kansas, and I'm a shareholder. I have two questions, and the first one I know the answer, so you can just say yes or no. Would you consider investing in indexes such as OEX, pure speculation? You're going to say yes. Number two, would you encourage investors to, if they were trying to get a lot of their investment, to use leaps on investments such as Coca-Cola instead of buying the stock? Use what on? I missed that. Leaps. Leak? Leaps. Oh, I see. We're still on options. Yeah, both the questions relate to futures of one sort, calls or whatever they may be. I think that investors should stick to buying ownership in businesses. It's not that you can't come up with a theoretical argument for buying, say, I mean, if you think Coca-Cola is attractive, you can say, well, I'd rather buy a five-year option on Coke than buy the stock directly because it introduces leverage without the risk of going broke. But I think that that's a dangerous path to start down because if it works well, it's dynamite to start playing with things that can expire and become worthless or can be bought with very low margin as the OEX options you were talking about. Borrowed money frequently leads to trouble, and it's not necessary. I mean, if you had some compelling reason, if you had to double your money by the end of the year and be shot, then I would head for the futures market because you need to do it. I mean, you have to introduce borrowed money, but you really ought to figure out how you can be happy with the present amount of money you've got and then figure that everything else is all to the good as you go along. And I don't think people, once they start focusing on short-term price behavior, which is the nature of buying calls or leaps or speculating in index futures, once you start concentrating on that, I think you're very likely to take your eye off the main ball, which is just valuing businesses. I don't recommend it. Charlie? Well, this is a group of affluent investors, and I don't think many of them did it in leaps. It's certainly true. If we'd operated Berkshire with considerable borrowed money over the years, you know, it would have done very much better than it has, but nobody knew what that amount of borrowed money, the appropriate level, would have been. And it wouldn't have made any difference to us. I mean, we have just as much fun doing what we've done than if we'd owned it on leverage and had been twice as much. I mean, it's not the way we approach it. If you have X and you think you're going to be way happier when you've got two X, it's probably not true. You really ought to enjoy where you are at the point. And if you can make 12 or 15 percent a year, and you desire to save and you like piling it up, it'll all come in time. And why risk losing what you need and have for what you don't need and don't have? It's never made a lot of sense to us. Warren wrote a letter when they were developing the security options businesses, and he urged the civilization not to allow the new exchanges. And you can see how much attention they paid to him. At the usual amount.","Warren Buffet advised his wife to invest in S&P index funds after his death for financial stability, avoid opinions and suggestions of others. He shared his aunt's story who worried about running out of money despite immense wealth."
152,https://youtu.be/SzKlsWsWRRY,SzKlsWsWRRY," Why have you advised your wife to invest in index funds after your death rather than Berkshire Hathaway? I believe Munger has counseled his offspring to quote, not be so dumb as to sell. Yeah. She won't be selling any Berkshire to buy the index funds. All of my Berkshire, every single share, will go to philanthropy. So I don't even regard myself as owning Berkshire, you know, basically. It's committed. So far about 40% has already been distributed. So the question is, somebody who is not an investment professional will be, I hope, reasonably elderly by the time the estate gets settled. And what is the best investment, meaning one that there would be less worry of any kind connected with, unless people coming around and saying, why don't you sell this and do something else and all those things? She's going to have more money than she needs. And the big thing then you want is money not to be a problem. And there will be no way that if she holds the S&P, virtually no way absent something happened with weapons of mass destruction, but virtually no way that she won't have, she'll have all the money that she possibly can use to have a little liquid money so that if stocks are down tremendously at some point, they close the stock exchange for a while, anything like that, she'll still feel that she's got plenty of money. And the object is not to maximize. It doesn't make any difference whether the amount she gets doubles or triples or anything of the sort. The important thing is that she never worries about money the rest of her life. And I had an aunt Katie here in Omaha, Charlie Noel, and worked for her husband as did I. And she worked very hard all her life and had lived in a house she paid, I think, I don't know, $8,000 for 45th and Hickory all her life. And because she was in Berkshire, she ended up, she lived in 97, she ended up with a few hundred million. And she would write me a letter every four or five months and she said, Dear Warren, you know, I hate to bother you, but am I going to run out of money? And I would, I would write her back and I'd say, Dear Katie, it's a good question because if you live 986 years, you're going to run out of money. And then about four or five months later, she'd write me the same letter again. And I have seen there's no way in the world if you've got plenty of money, that it should become a minus in your life. And there will be people if you've got a lot of money that come around with various suggestions for you, sometimes well-meaning, sometimes not so well-meaning. So if you've got something that's certain to deliver, you know, it was all in Berkshire, they'd say, Well, if Warren was alive today, you know, he would be telling you to do this. I just don't want anybody to go through that. And the S&P will be a, I think actually what I'm suggesting is what a very high percentage of people should do something like that. And I don't think they will have as, I think there's a chance they won't have as much peace of mind if they own one stock, and they've got neighbors and friends and relatives that are trying to induce them, like I say, sometimes well-intentioned, sometimes otherwise, to do something else. And so I think it's a policy that will get a good result and is likely to stick. Charlie? Well, as Becky said, the wonders are different. I want to hold the Berkshire. Well, I want to hold the Berkshire too. No, I mean, I don't like the Berkshire. I recognize the logic of the fact that S&P algorithm is very hard to beat. You know, diversified portfolio of big companies, it's all but impossible for most people. But you know, it's, I'm just more comfortable with the Berkshire. Well, it's the family business. Yeah, yeah. But I've just, I've seen too many people as they get older, particularly, being susceptible, just having to listen to the arguments of people coming along. Well, if you're going to protect your heirs from the stupidity of others, you may have some good system, but I'm not much interested in that subject. Okay. you","Alan suggests paying Warren Buffett more, but he declines, saying he is happy with his current salary and Social Security benefits.It mainly consists of a conversation between Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger discussing the merits of investing in the S&P 500 Index versus other options like Berkshire Hathaway stock."
153,https://youtu.be/TncE6VXx6C4,TncE6VXx6C4," Hi, Mr. Buffett. I'm Alan Maxwell. My wife and I are shareholders from Omaha. I'm going to keep things simple so you can understand them. Good. Alan's a friend of mine, so he can get away with that. Thank you, Colonel. Excluding the Buffett stake, I'm going to combine A and B shares. There are approximately 1 million A shares outstanding, correct? That'd be about right. Okay, about. Your salary is approximately, or is, $100,000 a year. It's been stuck there for a while. We'll talk about the board. Well, you'll be happy with my question. You can make an emotion if you're hurting where I think you are. In other words, we're paying you 10 cents a share to manage a $90,000 investment. That's remarkable in today's corporate culture. Thank you, Mr. Buffett. Thank you. Thanks. Alan, thank you. But I have to tell you, as I did last year, I would pay to have this job. I mean, it doesn't get any better than this. Well, rather than you doing something for us, I would like to suggest that we, the shareholders, do something for you. As a shareholder, I would be willing to pay you 25 cents an A share. That way you could save a little extra money for your retirement. Would you support such an idea? Alan, I'm getting Social Security now. And that really pretty well takes care of things. My family would go crazy if I made any more money. But I appreciate the offer, however. My heart's with you. Thank you. Okay, thanks, Alan. Let's go to number 10 and see if we can get 50 cents.","Warren Buffett shares advice on investing, success, and life, including investing in oneself, surrounding oneself with people who are better, and investing in a cross-section of America. He also reveals his breakfast routine, preferred song, movie, book, and what he carries in his wallet."
154,https://youtu.be/Tr6MMsoWAog,Tr6MMsoWAog," Warren, how would you define true success? Well, I've said many times that if you get to be 65 or 70 and later and the people that you want to have love you actually do love you, you're a success. I've never seen anybody that reaches that age. I mean, I'm not talking about somebody that's in extreme poverty or pain or something, but I've never seen anybody that if they have a lot of people that love them that is other than happy and I've seen some very, very wealthy people that they give testimonials to and name schools after and everything. Nobody loves them. Their own kids would say, he's in the attic, he's in the attic. What are, say, three pieces of advice you would give to people who are looking to succeed in business? Well, by far the best investment you can make is in yourself. For example, communication skills. I tell those students that come, they're going to graduate schools and business and they're learning all these complicated formulas and all that. If they just learn to communicate better, both in writing and in person, they increase their value at least 50%. I mean, if you can't communicate, somebody says, it's like winking at a girl in the dark. Everything happens, basically. You have to be able to get forth your ideas. That's relatively easy. I did it myself with the Dale Carnegie course. Some people wish I'd taken a shorter course now, which turns my talking later on. It's just hugely important. If you invest in yourself, nobody can take it away from you. The second thing, which I'll get a certain criticism for not living it, but I do tell those students that if I gave you a car, it would be the only car you'd get the rest of your life. You'd take care of it like you can't believe it. Any scratch, you'd fix that moment. You'd read the owner's manual. You'd keep it garage and do all these things. You get exactly one mind and one body in this world. You can't start taking care of it when you're 50. By that time, you'll have rushed it out if you haven't done anything. You should really make sure that you just remember that you've just got one mind and body to get through life with and to do the most with it. What about life advice? Life advice is the most important thing, aside from the things I've talked about already. It's really who you associate with. You want to associate with people that are better than you are. Basically, you'll go in the direction of the people that you associate with. You want to have the right heroes. If you want to emulate somebody, you better pick very carefully who you want to emulate. Obviously you can't pick your parents. They're going to have an enormous influence on you, but you don't get a choice on that. You get choices as you go down the line. Who you admire, who you want to copy, and the most important for most people in terms of that decision is their spouse. It's also important in terms of a partner in business, but the partner in life is the most important one. You want to pick a spouse that's better than you are. He or she. You hope they don't figure it out too fast. Biggest mistakes people make when investing? Well, they just don't realize that all you have to do is just buy a cross-section of America and then never listen to people like me or read the papers or do anything subsequently. They think that because you can trade, you should trade. You buy a farm, you buy an apartment house, you can't resell it tomorrow. Now you get something handed to you, liquidity, which is instant. You can sell and the costs of doing it are pennies compared to other kinds of investment activity. Because they can so easily move around, they do move around. Moving around is not smarter than investing. You have a pretty cool morning routine regarding what you have for breakfast and how prosperous you feel. What is that? Well, I now actually send somebody over to McDonald's usually to get me something. Since the publicity I got from earlier describing my habits at McDonald's, I now have somebody go in the office, but that was more for entertainment value. I actually eat exactly what I like to eat. If I liked it on my sixth birthday, at my sixth birthday party when we had hot dogs and hamburgers and coke and ice cream with chocolate, I still like it. And I don't care about anything subsequently. I discovered it all by the time I was six. If somebody offered me a deal when I was 20 and said you're going to live one year longer instead of living to 88, you'll live to 89 or whatever it may be, if you eat nothing but broccoli and Brussels sprouts and onions and all these things. I just said, I'll take the last year off, it probably won't be that good anyway. So I eat what I like to eat. I am not venturing something in that area. I like how you lumped in onions with broccoli and Brussels sprouts. I've never heard that before. I just don't happen to like onions. I don't put them in the same category. You and George H.W. Bush, I think. Is business school worth it? Depends on the person. Much more than it depends on the school. I wouldn't worry. Some people are going to get a lot out of advanced education and some people are going to get very little. And I don't even think it's important that every person go to college at all. We have all kinds of jobs at 70 or 80,000 a year that college training is not of use. I actually was not keen on going to college myself. My dad kind of jollied me into it. He could get me to do anything. If they'd had an SAT test in those days, he would have taken the test for me. I knew I could have a good time and I liked investing and I didn't really feel like I could read the books. It's a big commitment to take four years and the cost involved and maybe the loans involved and everything. I think depending on what your interests are in life, I don't think it's for everybody. I think it's for a lot of people. But there ought to be a reason you're going. And I didn't really see much reason. Alright, last question. So lightning round, there's a few. Do you ever drink water? Only under the rest. What is your favorite all-time song, Warren? It's undoubtedly, it's My Way. What about movie? Favorite movie? Well, I like The Bridge on the River Kwai because of the, there were a lot of lessons in that, plus it was enormously fascinating. Catchy tune also. Catchy tune also. Yeah, very. The ending of that was sort of the story of life. He created the railroad and did he really want the enemy to come in and cross it? Got it. Favorite book? Well, favorite book from an investor, the book that had the most impact on my life was The Intelligent Investor by Ben Graham. I knew you were going to say that. Favorite TV show? It's probably going to be, it would be Nebraska and some huge bowl game and winning. And finally, what do you carry in your wallet and how much money do you tend to carry around? Well, I probably carry maybe $400. I actually, my wife likes to use cash so I just take home a chunk of cash every now and then she doles it out. She looks at my billfold and sees whether all the hundreds are gone. That sticks a few in there. It's pretty simple. And credit cards? I've got an American Express card which I got in 1964 but I pay cash 98% of the time. If I'm in a restaurant I always pay cash. It's just easier. Warren Buffett, thanks very much.",Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger never had an argument in 60 years of working together. They believe in finding the right partner to work with and collecting things and friends to make life enjoyable.
155,https://youtu.be/TUnq33D678k,TUnq33D678k," Hi, good afternoon, Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger. My name is Bill He and I'm from Vancouver, Canada. You two make up an iconic duo and growing up, I found your investment strategies very admirable. And so my question is, how do you deal with conflicts when they arise between the two of you? Are you applying personal conflicts in terms of doing something ourselves versus having Berkshire do it? Or, oh between the two of you, I'm just, Charlie and I literally, and people find this hard to believe, but in 60 years we've never had an argument. We have disagreed about things and we'll probably keep occasionally disagreeing about this or that, but if you define an argument as something where emotion starts entering into it or anger of the sort, it just doesn't, it doesn't happen. I think that Charlie is smarter than I am, but I also think that there are certain things where I've spent more time on him than he has, and sometimes we both think we're right, and generally I get my way because Charlie is willing to do it that way and he's never second-guessed me when things have been wrong, and I wouldn't dream of second-guessing him if he were doing something that turned out to be wrong. We will never have a conflict basically. Charlie? Well the issue is not how long we get along. The issue is how it's going to work when we're gone, and the answer is fine. It's going to work fine. We're lucky that I ran into him when I was about 28 years old, and I both worked in the same grocery store and he grew up less than a block away from where I now live and everything, but I did not know who Charlie Munger was until I was 28, but clearly we're in sync in how we see the world and we're in sync on business decisions basically. Charlie would do fewer things than I would, but that's because I'm spending my time on this while he's designing dormitories or something, and we both keep busy in our own ways and we have a lot of fun dividing the labor like we do, but you really want to work. Having the right partners in life, particularly the right spouse, but having the right partners in life is enormously important. It's more fun with a partner, both in personal life and in business life, and you probably get more accomplished too, but you just have a better time. It would not be any fun to do work in a little room and make a ton of money trading around securities but never working with another human being. I recommend finding, well Charlie gave some advice in the movie finding the best person who will have you or something like that, sort of a limited objective. But it's not hard to be happy if you're a collector and don't run out of money. Collecting is intrinsically fun. Just think, how many people who you know in your whole life who were collectors who didn't run out of money who weren't happy collecting. We've been collecting all our lives. It's a very interesting thing. There's always a new rock to be turned over. It's interesting. Yeah, and certainly we've collected friends that make our lives better and that we have a good time with. It's very important, you know, who you select as your heroes or your friends, and I've been lucky in this. I mean it was only because of a doctor named Eddie Davis and his wife that Charlie and I even met. But if you keep doing enough things, some will work out very lucky. The best ones are ones that involve lifelong involvement with other people. We've got some of our directors, a number of our directors that have had similar impacts on me. I recommend that you look for somebody better than you are and then try to be like they are. It's funny, you know, we've lost people along the way. When I lost Warren's secretary, I thought, my God, she was so wonderful, glad us we'll never get another one. Becky is better. And then we had Bernard McKenzie who was a wonderful chief financial officer. He's gone and the in-current incumbent is better. We've been very lucky. And maybe the shareholders will be lucky a few more times.","Berkshire Hathaway sees opportunities for large acquisitions outside of the US, but they have not been as common, and the current environment with high prices and leveraged buyouts makes it challenging to make deals."
156,https://youtu.be/U4IEYUSNifQ,U4IEYUSNifQ," Yes, you've said that you are looking for non-insurance large acquisitions to put that cash to work. And when you've said that, I've usually thought of the United States because you're a big fan of the U.S. business. And I just was wondering whether you're seeing more opportunities as the rest of the world opens up, grows, whether there's opportunities for some of those mega transactions in other parts of the world, say Asia or Europe. Yeah, Gary, I would say that I've been disappointed in that because we do see some outside the United States. And thank heavens we saw the one we saw in Israel some years ago when Eitan wrote me a letter. But you know, we bought a business which is a very important part of Berkshire now. But we are still not, they're certainly aware of Berkshire halfway outside the United States, but they don't sort of pick up the phone automatically. In the United States, I think any large, particularly private company that thinks, is thinking about doing something, they at least think about Berkshire. But that, in Europe or Asia, that we are not embedded in the minds the same way. They know about us, they know we've got a lot of money, and they know we like to buy things. But we have really, we're on the radar screen big time in the United States, and we're not as, we're not as, we don't, the immediate desire to be sure that they've thought about the Berkshire option does not occur the same way outside the United States. And we've tried to encourage it a few ways, but I would say that the results have not been great at all. But I hope tomorrow, you know, I get a call from Germany or Britain or Italy or you name it, and Australia, wherever it may be, and I hope I get a call, and we get an opportunity to do it. There's a good many countries we'd be quite happy to put substantial money into it, and like I say, our experience in Israel has been just terrific. Charlie? Yeah, but the corporate acquisition game now is so driven by the leveraged buyout and the so-called, what do they call them, strategic, yes, strategic. I usually translate that into the barnyard language. And we're so, there's so much craziness in price from our viewpoint. Of course it's very hard for us to do it. The people in the leveraged buyout game who love massive leverage and don't mind high prices, even they are getting nosebleeds. It's hard, and it's not an environment that means that it allows Berkshire just to go out and buy a whole lot of companies. We have to wait. We've made a strategic deal that you can remember. Have we ever made a deal that we would have regarded as strategic? We never had a strategic plan unless you hid it from me. Okay, that answers that.",Buffett and Munger advise against investing in hedge funds due to high fees and lack of guarantee of success. They also raise concerns about the fairness of compensation arrangements and urge caution
157,https://youtu.be/UDkto8U_x8Y,UDkto8U_x8Y," Good afternoon, I'm Manuel Fernandez from Mexico City, Mexico, and I want to thank you for your valuable lessons on how to be good partners, and for exporting some good ideas and principles to the world for free. My simple question is, do you think it makes sense for individual investors to invest a part of their capital in hedge funds, or fund of hedge funds, somewhat like the $600 million investment Berkshire made in value capital? I would say that people that are now investing in hedge funds in aggregate are going to be disappointed. You don't get smarter because you're running something called a hedge fund, or something called private equity, or something called anything, an LBO fund, but what you do gain periodically is the ability to merchandise those things. There are fads in Wall Street, and Wall Street will sell what it can sell. Just remember that, you know, that may be as good as what the fellow quoted up in the upper levels there. And the hedge fund right now is in the midst of a fad. It's distinguished not by the ability to make more money, it's distinguished by the extraordinary amount of fees that are collected. And believe me, if the world, on $600 billion of money, is paying 2% fees and a percentage of the profits, and the losers go out of existence and the winners continue for a while and take money off the table, it is not going to be a great experience in aggregate for investors. Obviously, there are a few smart, honest people out there running funds, and they will do quite well. But if you buy them across the board, in my view, you're going to get a bad result. Charlie? Yeah, why would you want to invest with a guy whose basic thought process runs something like this? If a second layer of fees on top of a first layer of substantial fees is good for an investor, then a third layer of fees must be better yet. Why would you invest with somebody with a proposition like that? Just the idea of taking 2% plus percentages on top of that, that reflects, it may be what the traffic can bear, you know, Colis B. Huntington style, but that reflects an attitude toward people that we tend to regard as partners, investors. I think it's a basically unfair type of arrangement, and I don't like getting in, in general, I think it's a mistake to get in with people who propose unfair arrangements. In effect, they're getting, probably getting four times standard fees to begin with, and then on top of that they say, well, we want part of the action, and I would guess in many of those cases that they don't have all of their own money in the fund themselves. Maybe they have a substantial sum outside. Charlie and I both ran partnerships in the 60s and 50s with me and into the 70s with him that would generally be classified as hedge funds. They had the compensation arrangements somewhat similar at all, though not like they are now. And we did some, they had some similarities, but I don't think, I don't think we had quite the attitude toward the people who were trying to, that were asking to join us, that the present managers have. It's, as Charlie said, the fund-to-funds type stuff, I mean, it's really sort of unbelievable just piling on layer after layer on costs. It doesn't make the companies that are underlying these stocks they buy any better. And believe me, people don't become a genius just because you walk into some office and it says hedge funds on the door. I mean, they are, what they may be very good at is marketing. In fact, if they're good at marketing, they don't have to be good at anything else.","Buffett and Munger gave advice to young people on forming good habits, avoiding debt, and surrounding oneself with positive influences.

"
158,https://youtu.be/umy5scZYC3c,umy5scZYC3c," Hello, Mr. Buffett and Mr. Monger. My name is Justin Fong. I'm 14 years old from California. This is my fourth consecutive meeting attendance. I read in a book that you prefer talking to young people about life and financial concepts because we still have time to implement them. Can you please share some of the concepts with us? Thank you. I didn't catch the last part. There's something about sharing concepts. You want to repeat it? Can you please share the life and financial concepts that you prefer talking to young people about? He wants to know your life concepts and financial concepts that are useful to young people. Well, that's a fairly broad question. The financial concepts, you know, we've obviously spelled out in the reports. Charlie's probably better on the life concepts than I am. It is true that I do believe in spending the time that I spend giving talks or answering questions, doing it with young people. I do, I'm sure, well over a dozen a year. And I just think that obviously young people are more receptive to change or actually even forming habits that are going to be useful in life. And I think that people underestimate until they get older, they underestimate just how important habits are and how difficult they are to change when you're 45 or 50 and how important it is that you form the right ones when you're young. But Charlie, what do you have to say on that? Well, all the trite stuff is what works. I mean, you avoid doing the really dumb things like racing, moving trains to the crossing, experimenting with cocaine, risking getting AIDS or other unfortunate ailments. There's just a lot of standard things that take people down and you just give those a wide berth. And then you want to develop a good character and good mental habits and you want to learn from your mistakes, every single one, as you go along. It's pretty obvious, isn't it? Yeah, we would say even though we issue lots of credit cards, we'd say if, probably if I had one piece of advice to give to young people across the board, it would be just don't get in debt. The game plays a lot easier if you're a little bit ahead of the game than if you're behind the game. And Ben Franklin said that long ago in better terms, which Charlie can recite. But there's a real difference. I get letters every day from people that are in all kinds of financial trouble. And often it's health-related, which is tragic. But very often it relates to debt. I mean, they get behind the game and they're never going to catch up. And often, it may surprise you, but often I write these people, they're very decent people. They've just made mistakes. I just tell them the best course is bankruptcy. I mean, they are not going to catch up. And they should start all over again and they should never look at a credit card the rest of their life. But it would have been better if they'd gotten that advice a little earlier. It's very tempting to spend more than you earn. I mean, it's very understandable. But it's not a good idea. And of course, you particularly want to avoid evil or seriously irrational people, particularly if they are attractive members of the opposite sex. Charlie knows more about this. The expert. Yeah, you know, it's better to hang out with people better than you. I've found that very easy to do over the years. But if you're picking associates, pick out those whose behavior is somewhat better than yours and you'll drift in that direction. Charlie, if you hang out with a bad bunch, you're very likely to find your own behavior worse over time. But like Charlie says, the trite advice, which Ben Franklin was handing out a few hundred years ago, really works. Look at the people you like to associate with. What qualities do they have that you can't have if you want to? Look at the people that you can't stand to be around. What qualities do you have that they have? Can you get rid of them? You can do all of that at a young age. It gets harder as you go along. It's not very complicated. And my final word of advice would be, if this gives you a little temporary unpopularity in your peer group, the hell with them. Thank you. And as advice, a little more applicable to me and Charlie, I was reading about a woman that was 103 and they said, what do you like about being 103? And she says, no peer pressure.","Buffett and Munger credit their success in value investing to continuous learning, the right temperament, and the ability to quickly eliminate bad ideas. They stress the importance of having a solid investment framework and understanding businesses and industries."
159,https://youtu.be/uS0Ckv0xAkg,uS0Ckv0xAkg," My name is Arturo Berlinborg. I'm from Washington, D.C. I'll be graduating from Harvard College in June and beginning a career in value investing. So I sure hope we're all right in thinking that this century will be just as good as the last for value investors. You've been doing this since you were my age, if not younger. So I'm wondering what habits have contributed most to your ability to continue learning and improving your investment decisions in a changing business and financial environment. I would say that, at least in my case, I haven't been continually learning in terms of the basic principles. You always learn a little more about given techniques, or we learn, you know, I learn more about some industries over time, and therefore maybe I've widened the universe in which I can operate, although more funds narrows it back down, unfortunately. But I know more about businesses than I knew 20 years ago or 40 years ago. I haven't really changed the principles. The last change, the basic principles, are still Ben Graham. They were affected in a significant way by Charlie and Bill Fisher in terms of looking at the better businesses. But I didn't leave Graham behind on that. And I really haven't learned any new fundamental principles, but I may have learned a little bit more about how business operates over time. And there's really nothing, I mean, you ought to get an investment framework that comes straight from, in my view, from the intelligent investor and from Bill Fisher, more from the intelligent investor, actually. And then I think you ought to learn everything you can about industries and businesses where you think you have the ability to get your mind around them if you work at them. And with that arsenal, you'll do very well if you've got the temperament for the business. Charlie? Yeah, well, of course, I've watched Warren all these decades, and he's learned a hell of a lot, even the last 20 or 30 years. So it's a game of continuing to learn, and he can denigrate this little froufou that enables him to pick the biggest oil company in China or this or that. But those basic principles alone that he knew a long time ago wouldn't have given him the ability to make the recent investment decisions as well as he's made them. It's a lifelong game, and if you don't keep learning, other people will pass you by. I would say temperament still is the most important one, don't you, Charlie? Yes, of course. But temperament alone won't do it. No, temperament alone won't do it. You have to have the temperament and the right basic idea, and then you have to keep at it with a lot of curiosity for a long, long time. But you don't have to be blindingly ��� have any blinding insights or have a high IQ to look at a PetroChina, for example. No. You know, I mean, it's a ��� when you get a company that is doing two and a half million barrels a day, that's three and a half percent of the world or three percent of the world's oil production. You know, and they're selling based on U.S. prices using WTI, you know, as West Texas Intermediate as a base price, and where they have a significant part of the marketing and refining in a country. The tax rate's 30 percent. They say they're going to pay out 45 percent to you in dividends. Don't have unusual amounts of leverage. If you're buying something like that at well under half what ��� maybe a third of what comparable oil companies are selling for, that's not high-level stuff. I mean, you have to read some ��� you have to be willing to read the reports. And ��� but I enjoy doing that, but you wouldn't say that requires any high-level insights or anything, Charlie. Well, when you were buying that block of stock, nobody else to speak of was buying. Thank heavens. So the insights can't have been all that common. No, I think that takes a certain amount of what an old old friend used to call uncommon sense. He used to say there is no common sense. When people say common sense, they mean uncommon sense. Part of it, I think, is being able to tune out folly is distinguished from recognizing wisdom. And if you've just got whole categories of things, you just bat away so your brain isn't cluttered with them, then you're better able to pick up a few sensible things to do. Yeah, we don't consider many stupid things. You know, and we get rid of them fast. In fact, people get irritated with us because they'll call us, and when they're in the middle of the first sentence, we'll just tell them, forget it. We don't ��� we can see it coming. And that's the way ��� actually, the mind works. There was a great article in the New Yorker magazine 30 years ago or so, a little more than that. It was when the Fischer-Sposky chess matches were going on. And it got into the speculation of would the humans being able to take on computers in chess. And, you know, here were these computers doing hundreds of thousands of calculations a second. And they said, how can the human mind, when all you're really looking at is the future, you know, the results from various moves in the future, how can a human mind deal with a computer that's thinking at speeds that are unbelievable? And of course, they examined the subject some, and a mind like ��� well, in fact, all minds, but some much better than others. But a Fischer-Sposky essentially was eliminating about 99.99 percent of the possibilities without even thinking about it. So it wasn't that they could out-think the computer in terms of speed, but they had this ability in what you might call grouping or exclusion, where essentially they just got right down to the few possibilities out of these zillions of possibilities that really had any chance of success. And getting rid of the nonsense, I mean, just figuring that, you know, people start calling you and saying, I've got this great, wonderful idea. Don't spend 10 minutes, you know, once you know in the first sentence that it isn't a great, wonderful idea. Don't be polite. Go through the whole process. Charlie and I are pretty good at that. We can hang up very fast. Well, there you have it. All you've got to do is go at it in the way that Vasily Smyslov did when he was the world champion of chess and just do the same thing in investments.","Buffett and Munger believe that every business is a value proposition and do not see a distinction between growth and value. They also see an opportunity in National RV, a recreational vehicle company, which is currently trading at four times earnings"
160,https://youtu.be/vo_TWaV6Xy8,vo_TWaV6Xy8," Good morning Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger. My name is Steve Yates. I'm from Chicago. I'm a Berkshire shareholder and this is my sixth year coming to this meeting. I'd like to thank you for all your time and advice through the years. It's been great. I'd also like to thank all those wonderful people who sold Berkshire this year for giving us an opportunity to purchase more of the world's greatest company for dirt cheap prices. We will convey your thanks. I own another stock which sells for four times current trailing earnings. Every quarter we get a report. Earnings go up, sales go up, cash flow goes up, the equity base expands, they gain market share and the stock goes down. The company has a 60% five year annualized growth rate and sells at four times earnings. I have two related questions. First, is this a growth stock or a value stock and could you please give us your definitions of these terms? Second, the company sells recreational vehicles. Demographic trends in the recreation and leisure areas, RVs, cruise lines, golf equipment, etc. seem to be quite good. Do you see any opportunities for Berkshire here? Thanks. Well, the question about growth and value we've addressed in past annual reports, but they are not two distinct categories of business. Every business is worth the present. If you knew what it was going to be able to disgorge in cash between now and Judgment Day, you could come to a precise figure as to what it is worth today. Now, elements of that can be the ability to use additional capital at good rates and most growth companies that are characterized as growth companies have that as a characteristic. But there is no distinction in our minds between growth and value. Every business we look at as being a value proposition. The potential for growth and the likelihood of good economics being attached to that growth are part of the equation in evaluation. But they are all value decisions. A company that pays no dividends, growing 100% a year, is losing money now, that's a value decision. You have to decide how much value you're going to get. Actually, it's very simple. The first investment primer, when would you guess it was written? The first investment primer that I know of, and it was pretty good advice, was delivered in about 600 B.C. by ESOP. And ESOP, you'll remember, said, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. Incidentally, ESOP did not know it was 600 B.C. He was smart, but he wasn't that smart. Now, ESOP was on to something, but he didn't finish it, because there's a couple of other questions that go along with that. But it is an investment equation, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. He forgot to say exactly when you were going to get the two from the bush, and he forgot to say what interest rates were that you had to measure this against. But if he'd given those two factors, he would have defined investment for the next 2,600 years, because a bird in the hand is, you know, you will trade a bird in the hand, which is investing, you lay out cash today. And then the question is, as an investment decision, you have to evaluate how many birds are in the bush. You may think there are two birds in the bush or three birds in the bush, and you have to decide when they're going to come out and when you're going to acquire them. Now, if interest rates are 5%, and you're going to get two birds from the bush in five years, we'll say, versus one now, two birds in the bush are much better than a bird in the hand now. So you want to trade your bird in the hand and say, I'll take two birds in the bush, because if you're going to get them in five years, that's roughly 14% compounded annually, and interest rates are only 5%. But if interest rates were 20%, you would decline to take two birds in the bush five years from now. You would say, that's not good enough, because at 20%, if I just keep this bird in my hand and compound it, I'll have more birds than two birds in the bush in five years. Now, what's all that got to do with growth? Well, usually growth, people associate with a lot more birds in the bush, but you still have to decide when you're going to get them. And you have to measure that against interest rates, and you have to measure it against other bushes and other equations. And that's all investing is. It's a value decision based on what it is worth, how many birds are in that bush, when you're going to get them, and what interest rates are. Now, if you pay $500 billion, and when we buy a stock, we always think in terms of buying the whole enterprise, because it enables us to think as businessmen rather than as stock speculators. So, let's just take a company that has marvelous prospects, is paying you nothing now, and you buy it at an evaluation of $500 billion. Now, if you feel that 10% is the appropriate rate of return, and you can pick your figure, that means that if it pays you nothing this year, but starts paying next year, it has to be able to pay you $55 billion in perpetuity each year. But if it's not going to pay until the third year, then it has to pay you $60.5 billion in perpetuity, in perpetuity, to justify the present price. Every year that you wait to take a bird out of the bush means that you have to take out more birds. It's that simple. And I question in my mind whether sometimes whether people who pay $500 billion implicitly for a business by buying 10 shares of stock at some price, are really thinking of the mathematical, the mathematics implicit in what they are doing to deliver, let's just assume that there's only going to be a one-year delay before the business starts paying out to you, and you want to get a 10% return, and you pay $500 billion. That means $55 billion of cash that they have to be able to disgorge to you year after year after year. To do that, they have to make perhaps $80 billion or close to a pre-tax. Now, you might look around at the universe of businesses in this world and see how many are earning $80 billion pre-tax, or $70 or $60 or $50 or $40 or $30, and you won't find any. So it requires a rather extraordinary change in profitability to give you enough birds out of that particular bush to make it worthwhile to give up the one that you have in your hand. The second part of your question about whether we'd be willing to buy a wonderful business at four times earnings, I think I could get even Charlie interested in that. But let's hear it from Charlie. I'd like to know what that is. He was hoping you would ask that fellow that's got all his net worth in his stock, and who has a captive audience. Tell us what it is. You've got to tell us. We're begging you. You want the name of the company? We want the name of the company. We're dying to get the name. Wait until I get my pencil out. Okay. It's called National RV, and it's based in California, and they sell recreational vehicles. Okay. Well, you've got a crowd of people who have birds in the hand, and we will see what they do in terms of National RV. Charlie, do you have anything further on growth and value, etc.? Watch him carefully, folks. Well, I agree that all intelligent investing is value investing. You have to acquire more than you really pay for, and that's a value judgment. But you can look for more than you're paying for in a lot of different ways. You can use filters to sift the investment universe, and if you stick with stocks that can't possibly be wonderful to just put away in your safe deposit box for 40 years, but are underpriced, then you have to keep moving around all the time. As they get closer to what you think the real value is, you have to sell them and then find others. So it's an active kind of investing. The investing where you find a few great companies and just sit on your ass because you've correctly predicted the future, that is what it's very nice to be good at. The movie was G-rated, even though... Is that it, Charlie?","Buffett and Munger caution against getting caught up in speculative booms, as they believe that commodity prices, particularly in metals and oil, are responding more to speculative forces than fundamental ones."
161,https://youtu.be/w11iRDredD8,w11iRDredD8," Hello, my name is Johann Freudenberg from Hannover, Germany. Do you think we are in a commodity bubble? Thank you. Certainly not in agriculture commodities. They haven't. They haven't done anything if you're talking about wheat or corn or soybeans or something. But if you get into the metals, oil, and the wheat, there's been a terrific move. The most extreme probably has been copper, isn't it? I would say that. Oil, if you go back a few years to when it was at $10 a barrel, it's been more extreme than copper. But you are undoubtedly, it's like most trends. At the beginning, it's driven by fundamentals, and at some point, speculation takes over. The very fact that the fundamentals caused something that people looked at for years without getting excited about. Fundamentals change the picture in some way. Copper does get a little short, or people get a little worried about currency and maybe gold goes up or whatever it may be. But it's that old story of what the wise man does in the beginning, the fool does in the end. And with any asset class that has a big move that's based initially on fundamentals is going to attract speculative participation at some point. And that speculative participation can become dominant as time goes by, and the famous case always being tulip bulbs. I mean, tulips may have been more attractive than dandelions or something, so people paid a little more money for them. But once a price history develops that causes people to start looking at an asset that they never looked at before and to get envious of the fact that they're not going to get a good price because he saw this early and so on, that takes over. And my guess is that we're seeing some of that in the commodity area, and of course I think we've seen some of it in the housing area too. How far it goes you never know. I mean, it just, some things go on to just unbelievable heights and then, you know, silver went back in there. That was manipulation to some extent, but it got up to $50 an ounce very briefly back in the early 80s. The eyes of the world that never looked at silver when it was $1.60 or $1.30 back in the 60s, you know, everybody in the world was looking at it and some were shorting and some were buying, but it becomes a speculative football. And my guess is that an awful lot of the activity in something like copper now is speculative on both sides of the market. If, you know, it goes to $5 a pound, who knows, but you are looking at a market that is responding more to speculative forces now than to fundamental forces in my view. Charlie? Well, I think we've demonstrated how little we know about commodity prices by our very skillful operations in silver. I think you can change that from our to, it's mine actually. I bought it very early. I sold it very early. Other than that, everything I did was perfect. I mean, we managed to minimize things there with great efficiency. Or I managed to. Charlie didn't have anything to do with that. I was the silver king there for a while. We did make a few dollars on it. But we're not good at the game of when it gets into the speculative area, figuring out how far a speculative boom will go. If the fundamentals are attractive, we think we're getting a lot for our money buying equities or whatever it may be. We'll make some money. We may not make as much money remotely as much money as somebody who plays out the last 30 days or 30 weeks of a real wild orgy. I mean, these things, they tend to be the wildest toward the end. But that gets back to the question of Cinderella of the ball. I mean, you're there, you're having a wonderful time, the punch bowl is flowing, the dance partners are getting prettier all the time, and you know at midnight it's going to turn to pumpkins and mice. You look around the room and you think just one more dance, one more good-looking guy, one more glass of champagne, and you think you're going to get out of there at midnight. And of course, everybody else thinks they're going to get out of there at midnight too. And in the end, it does turn to pumpkins and mice. In this game, as I've said, Adam Smith said it many years ago, a fellow named Jerry Goodman wrote under the student of Adam Smith, he says the problem with that particular dance for Cinderella is that there are no clocks on the wall. And in the markets, if you're talking copper now, if you're talking internet stocks in If you're talking uranium stocks in the 1950s, there are no clocks on the wall. And the party does get to be more fun, you know, minute after minute, hour after hour, and then it does turn to pumpkins and mice.","Buffett emphasizes the importance of interest rates in stock valuation and advises investors to focus on long-term coupons or returns. He also highlights the need for education to understand investing in businesses and suggests that some people may not be psychologically fit to own stocks.




"
162,https://youtu.be/W4AIul7_9o8,W4AIul7_9o8," Part of the reason that you've been so bullish on equities for many years at this point is the interest rate environment. You've looked at interest rates and said interest rates are gravity on stock prices, and when interest rates are so low, stock prices inevitably are going to climb. There's been this really weird thing that's been happening in the markets where all of a sudden good news that we got from a good jobs report made people start to worry that interest rates were going to climb and that the Fed was going to raise rates more than anticipated. People got really nervous around that and you can still see it every time we get up on the 10-year back towards 3%. It gives investors, or at least traders I should say, some concerns about what's happening. How do you kind of... If you buy a 30-year government bond, it has a whole bunch of coupons attached. In the old days it was electronic, but it has a whole bunch of coupons. The coupon says 3% or whatever it may say, and you know that's what you're going to get between now and 30 years from now, and then they're going to give you the money back. What is the stock? The stock is the same sort of thing. It has a bunch of coupons. It's just they haven't printed the numbers on them yet, and it's your job as an investor to print those numbers on. Those numbers say 10%, and most American businesses earn over 10% on tangible equity. If they say 10%, that bond is worth a hell of a lot more money than a bond that says 3% on it. But if that government bond goes to 10%, it changes the value of this equity bond that in effect you're buying. You are buying when you buy an interest in General Motors or Berkshire Hathaway or anything, you are buying something that over time is going to return cash to you, maybe a long time in terms of Berkshire, but it will be bigger numbers. Those are the coupons, and it's up to you, your job as an investor, to decide what you think those coupons will be, because that's what you're buying, and you're buying the discounted value. The higher the yardstick goes, and the yardstick is government bonds, the less attractive these other bonds look, and that's just fundamental economics. So in 1982 or 1983, when the law and government bond got to 15%, a company that was earning 15% on equity was worth no more than book value under those circumstances, because you could buy a 30-year strip of bonds and guarantee yourself for 15% a year, and a business that earned 12% was a subpar business then, but a business that earns 12% when the government bond is 3% is one hell of a business now, and that's why they sell for very fancy prices. So 3% is a long way from 15% that you were just talking about. Absolutely, but I watched it go from 3 to 15, no, 2. Is there an inflection point on that way? Because people think, oh my gosh, we've gone from 2.4% to 2.9%, and that's a big difference. That's not much. That's still the way we should be measuring these things, not on the absolute movement or the percentage gain movement over time. 2.4% to 2.9% is nothing if you're comparing it with businesses that earn 12% on equity and reinvest. And the S&P, you can just look at the figures for decades, has earned on tangible equity, has earned a lot more than that, and it translates into higher prices than it should. Is there a tipping point along the way, or is it a gradual decline in terms of efficiency? Nobody knows. But it is gravity. I mean, if you told me interest rates were going to be 15% next year on long bonds, there's a lot of equities I wouldn't want to own now, and I would buy a lot of governments at 15, and I kind of wish I had it in 1982, but I didn't. If I told you that the long bond was going to trade at 4.5% to 5% next year... It makes a difference. It's been idiotic to own long bonds. I talk about this in the report in terms of art. It's just been idiotic. And big public pension funds and all that, they sat there and they owned bonds. Now, they may have bought them on a 4% or 5% basis, but if they go to a 3% basis, they're selling way above par. The way people think about it is they do some very silly things. I mean, you lay this out in the annual report, a lot of retail investors are told that they should have a certain percent of their portfolio in bonds. Maybe they're told 60-40, maybe they're told 70-30 stocks to bonds. That's something that you should do, and that's the safe way of doing it. What are they missing? Some people should not own stocks at all because they just get too upset with price fluctuations. If you're going to do dumb things because your stock goes down, you shouldn't own a stock at all. What are dumb things? Selling a stock just goes down? Yeah, selling a stock just goes down. If you buy your house at $20,000 and somebody comes along the next day and says, I'll pay you $15,000, you don't sell it because the quote's $15,000. You look at the house or whatever it may be. But some people are not actually emotionally or psychologically fit to own stocks. But I think more of them would be if you get educated on what you're really buying, which is part of a business. And the longer you hold stocks, the less risky they become. Whereas the longer the maturity of a bond, the more risky it becomes. Do you feel like that's a message that is getting through to people? It's one that you repeat again and again. I always feel like I was watching a lot of the Olympics, and I felt like what they do in the Olympics is so easy. These guys sailing through the air and doing massive spins on the ice and turns. And then I read your annual letter and I think, oh, it's really easy to invest. And then I walk away and realize it's not that easy. It's not easy psychologically for many people. I've been teaching since I was 21. I taught my first class on investments. And I had a class last week with 11 schools, 220 students. And some of them get it and some of them don't. People would rather gamble. I mean, the idea that you can double your money in six months, that's just going to, it's why people go to the races, why they go to Vegas, you know, whatever it may be. They even know the odds are against them, and they still do it. I mean, it's a strong instinct to want to get rich fast. And I don't know how to do it.","Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, is not interested in Bitcoin and believes that governments will eventually suppress the cryptocurrency. However, he recognizes the importance of blockchain technology and its practical applications."
163,https://youtu.be/wfhC7ks4vlc,wfhC7ks4vlc," I could care less about Bitcoin. I don't know why I said anything about it. The blockchain is a technology, which is a good technology. We actually use it. It will be used for a lot of different things. God bless the blockchain. Cryptocurrencies and digital currencies, I think, are also fine. You know, JP Moore moves $6 trillion around the world every day. We don't do it in cash. It's done digitally. If it can be done digitally with the blockchain, so be it. But it will still be a dollar cryptocurrency. What I have an issue with is a non-fiat cryptocurrency. A dollar, so crypto, sterling, euro, yen, they're all fine. I don't personally understand the value of something that has no actual value. You all can do whatever you want, and I don't care. Alright, that sounds definitive. Bitcoin hit a new high today. I could care less what Bitcoin trades for. How it trades, why it trades, who trades it. If you're stupid enough to buy it, you'll pay the price for it one day. I've also told people that it can trade at $100,000 before it trades to zero. Tulip balls traded for $75,000, something like that. The only value of Bitcoin is what the other guy will pay for it. And I think, honestly, I think it's a good chance that Bitcoin, a lot of the buyers out there are up there, jazzing up every day, so that maybe you'll buy it too and take them out. And I quite mean that, by the way. You know, these people are very good at manipulating the press these days and getting news out. So every day, you know, you have CNBC, non-stop Bitcoin. Who cares about Bitcoin? I mean, you know, the world economy is so big, we move, JPMorgan alone, these companies, six trillion dollars, we move all this money, and Bitcoin in total is, all these currencies are $50 billion, maybe a billion dollar trades a day. And the other thing I've always made of Bitcoin, governments, and this is not a technological statement, governments are going to crush it one day. Governments like to know where the money is, who has it, and what you're doing with it. In case you haven't noticed. Okay? And governments like to control their currency, like to control their own economy. So China's already put curbs on it. Japan, you know, they say Japan accepted Bitcoin. No, they didn't. When I gathered Japan, they told a J-coin, it's a yen cryptocurrency. It's not a non-fiat. And there's a big, and people have said, legitimately, okay, it's close to gold, not really. Gold is limited and has been around a long time, and it's close to a fiat currency, not really. A fiat currency is where the government says, this is your legal tender. You have to give it and accept it. And there's a central bank. Now, of course, they can misuse it, the central bank, and inflate it. So there is a use case for Bitcoin. If you live in Venezuela, North Korea, or if you're a criminal. Great, great product. I mean that. It's better than cash or deposits in that country, Cuba. But this is the last time I'm ever going to answer a question of Bitcoin, because I really don't care. So you mentioned cryptocurrency. I know you said you weren't going to talk about Bitcoin anymore, but you're at Stanford. Some of us have put all our student loan money into it. And I have to ask you anyway. Why do you believe that governments and regulators can't allow the existence of a global currency based on central address? I become like a spokesman against Bitcoin. I don't care about Bitcoin. I could give a shit, to tell you the truth. I promised myself I wouldn't talk about it the next day. There are four things really quickly. Blockchain is real. It's technology. It can be public or private. It can be for five people. It can be for five million. It's going to work. We already use it in a lot of test cases, stuff like that. So we're a supporter. I do worry a little bit about the security, because like I said, we move $6 trillion a day, real time, quite efficiently, effectively, and secure. Before you replace that, you got to make sure you can do it right. There are three cryptocurrencies, three types, three separate types. One is ICOs. ICO, and I haven't studied these things, but you're paying for a token that allows you to use a service, which is very different than a currency. But that's what people call cryptocurrencies. And maybe, Jim, maybe you've studied some of these ICOs. I have no idea about some would give you cloud services or some give you investing services. That's one type. The second type, you can use cryptocurrency for fiat currency. Well, that works, because it just uses a different technology to move money around. Basically, keep your money digitally anyway. And if you just keep different files in a different way and distributed ledgers, that would work fine. What I've always thought about Bitcoin as a currency and a store of value and a payment mechanism is that governments, and this is my belief, and I may be wrong. I'm not saying you can't go to $100,000, that governments are going to crush it one day for three reasons. OK, one is when it's used for terrorist activities. OK, it'll happen. It's a matter of time. It'll go back to a Bitcoin. And then all of a sudden, the DOJ, the United States government, all these people in Washington who profess to love technology and novelty of Bitcoin are going to change their mind. Number two, when a lot of little old ladies lose their money, because the spec of a vehicle that was allowed to exist by the United States government, and they're going to lose their money and they're going to be pounding. You should have done something about it. And number three is the most important, whenever a government forms itself, and you go to any country in the world, pull out the currency, look at the date. That fiat currency was formed by that government with the central bank because governments like to control their currency, like to know who has it, where it's going, why it's going, when it went, et cetera. And right now, Bitcoin is a novelty. It's $100 billion, you know, and a billion dollars a day trades hands, obviously mostly speculation. OK, and obviously there's a real use case. I'm not making this a joke. Venezuela, Cuba, North Korea, criminal, drug money. That'll always be true. So always have a use case that's valuable to someone because it's better in those countries to do some, you know, to have that than have that currency or cash or money in a bank because the government, they take that too. And if you go to Argentina, they had effectively savings accounts. The government just went in and took it. They just took it. And, you know, of course, everyone took the money out of the bank right after that, and the country basically collapsed. But so that's the reason why. It's going to get bigger and bigger and they're going to want to control it. And it's not the same as a fiat currency. If you had currency, the government says you must take this as legal tender. And at par, effectively cash at par, you know, and it's always worth par. And I don't know why a crypto dollar would ever be something that, you know, a store value be worse than a crypto Bitcoin. So, you know, that's my view. And I may be wrong and which I doubt. I've been wrong before, though. And if I'm wrong, I also don't care very much. It'll never affect my life. It's not because they write or the bankers are defending their stuff. That's absolutely untrue. You know, if Bitcoin works and we have to do some Bitcoin, we'll do that too. Kind of a win-win there. Exactly. When the DOJ calls on up and says that's an illegal currency and it's against the laws of the United States of America, if you do it again, we'll put you in jail. It's over. So you really think that's illegal? There will be, this is my personal opinion, there will be no real non-controlled currency in the world. There's no government that's going to put up with it for long. Anybody here want to? It's kind of cute now. You know, a lot of the senators in Congress will say I support Silicon Valley innovation. There will be no currency that gets around government controls. Anybody here want to take an opposite view? The technology will be used. It may even be used to transport currency, but it will be U.S. dollars. But digital currency will be stopped. Yes. Virtual currency, where it's called a Bitcoin as opposed to a U.S. dollar. These things may be very well for cheap transfers of money. But the right digital currency will be stopped. Yes. A virtual currency, where it's called a Bitcoin, as opposed to a U.S. dollar. These things may be very well for cheap transfers of money.",Buffett recommends investing in broad index funds with minimal fees over time. He warns against relying on single metrics like P/E ratio to determine when to buy/sell stocks. Munger says high stock prices may provide lower returns but are still better than low-interest rates on deposits or bonds.
164,https://youtu.be/wSIXEXIFWgY,wSIXEXIFWgY," Good morning. My name is Ted Friedman. I'm from Cincinnati, Ohio. You said in a 1996 annual report that most investors will find that the best way to own common stocks is in an index fund that charges minimal fees. Two questions. First, there are a lot of different index funds that hold different baskets of stocks. What criteria would you use or recommend to select an appropriate index fund? Second, the price to earnings ratio of the S&P 500 is significantly higher than its historical average. What benchmark should an investor use in purchasing this index? I would say that in terms of the index fund, I would just take a very broad index. I would take the S&P 500 as long as I wasn't putting all my money in at one time. If I were going to put money into an index fund in relatively equal amounts over a 20 or 30 year period, I would pick a fund. I know Vanguard has very low costs. I'm sure there are a whole bunch of others that do. I just haven't looked at the field. But I would be very careful about the costs involved because all they're doing for you is buying that index. I think that the people who buy those index funds on average will get better results than the people that buy funds that have higher costs attached to them because it's just a matter of math. If you have a very high percentage of funds being institutionally managed and a great many institutions charge a lot of money for doing it and others charge a little, they're going to get very similar gross results but different net results. And I recommend to all of you reading John. John Bogle's written a couple of books in the last five years and I can't give you the titles but they're very good books and anybody investing in funds should read those books before investing or if you've already invested you still should read the books and it's all you need to know really about fund investing. So I would pick a broad index but I wouldn't toss a chunk in at any one time. I would do it over a period of time because the very nature of index funds is that you are saying I think America's business is going to do well over or reasonably well over a long period of time but I don't know enough to pick the winners and I don't know enough to pick the winning times. There's nothing wrong with that. I don't know enough to pick the winning times. Occasionally I think I know enough to pick a winner but not very often. And I certainly can't pick winners by going down through the whole list and saying this is a winner and this isn't and so on. So the important thing to do if you have an overall feeling that business is a reasonable place to have your money over a long period of time is to invest over a long period of time and not make any bet implicitly by putting a big chunk in at a given time. As to the criteria as to when you should or shouldn't I don't think there are any great criteria on that. I don't think price earnings ratio determines things. I don't think price book ratios, price sales ratios. I don't think any, there's no single metric I can give you or that anyone else can give you in my view that will tell you this is a great time to buy stocks or not to buy stocks or anything of the sort. It just isn't that easy. That's why you go to an index fund and that's why you buy over a period of time. It isn't that easy. You can't get it by reading a magazine. You can't get it by watching television. You'd love to have something that said if PEs are 12 or below or some number you buy and if they're 25 or above you sell. It doesn't work that way. It's a more complex business than that. It couldn't be that easy when you think about it. So if you are buying an index fund you are protecting yourself against the fact that you don't know the answers to those questions but you think you can do well over time without knowing the answers to those questions as long as you consciously recognize that fact. If you're a young person and you intend to save a portion of your income over time, I just say just pick out a very broad index and I would probably use the S&P 500 because I think if you start getting beyond that you start starting to think you should be in small caps this time and large caps that time or this foreign side and as soon as you do that you're in a game you don't know. You're not equipped to play in all candor. That would be my recommendation. Charlie? I think his second worry is that common stocks could become so high priced that if you bought index funds you wouldn't expect to do very well. I didn't think I'd live long enough to think that was likely to happen but now I think that may happen. But probably what you're saying there is that they could get to a level and they'd have to be at a sustained level like that for a long time. They could be there and stay there for a long time. In which case you might make 3 or 4 percent but would there be anything way better than that around under those circumstances anyway? And pass the paint brittle please. Well in Japan where something like this happened the return from owning a nice index over the last 13 years or so is negative. Can something as horrible as that happen here? I mean is it conceivable? I think the answer is yes. But the option in Japan of course is to have deposits in a bank or own Japanese bonds at somewhere between 0 and 1 or 1.5 percent. So if rates on everything get very low which means stocks sell very high then it just means that you live in a different world than existed 20 or 30 years ago when generally capital got paid better. I must say that we have very good packaging.","Charlie Munger advises individuals to be patient, rational, live within their means, and reduce expectations in modern finance for greater happiness.It emphasizes the importance of choosing a broad index fund, such as the S&P 500, due to its potential for better long-term results and lower costs.

He also mentions the potential challenges of high stock prices and compares the situation to Japan's market experience. "

He suggests looking for businesses with matched up revenues and expenses close to cash.
167,https://youtu.be/yk6ulqvpLnM,yk6ulqvpLnM," I don't think it's working. Hello? Okay. Hi, Goran Pulich from New York City. I have a two-part question, first part very short. I think a lot of people have difficulty valuing businesses because of some convoluted accounting schemes that are out there. Do you have any suggestions in terms of books or something you can read where you can sort of make sense of some of the accounting stories that are going around? Well, that's a good question. Abe Breloff used to write for Barron's quite frequently on various accounting machinations, and Barron's has continued that somewhat. But you're right that there are people out there who will try to paint pictures with accounting that are something far from the economic reality. And sometimes the rules of accounting themselves lead to that. I would say that when the accounting confuses you, I would just tend to forget about it as a company. I mean, it's probably, it may well be intentional, and in any event, you don't want to go near it. We have never had any great investment results from companies whose accounting we regarded as suspect. I can't think of a one. Can you tell me? No. It's a very bad sign. I made a short sale once that worked out well in a case like that. It really, accounting can be a, accounting can offer you a lot of insight into the character of management. And I would say there's a lot, you know, there's a, you run into a fair amount of bad accounting. You used to call it creative accounting, but you, and you probably run into a lot more if it was allowed. But some companies have been able to push their auditors pretty far. And I would be very skeptical of anything that looks suspicious to you. I think there have been, there have been a couple of things written, but I can't think of where they've appeared, where people talk about the questions of, you know, what, obviously, if some prepaid expense, deferred asset accounts start building up, suspiciously high, and inventories look out of line, you know, with sales and particularly the trend of them and all that. You want to look twice at companies like that. Life insurance, you know, frequently, you know, we see weak accounting in it. You can, when you don't have a product where revenues and expenses are being matched up on something close to cash in the short term, you have the opportunity for people playing games with numbers. And some people have learned how to do that very well, and they've sometimes created long-lasting stock manipulation or promotion schemes that have enriched themselves at the, or they've enriched the managers or the creators of it at the expense of the public over time. If you ever get suspicious about accounting, just go on to the next company.",Buffett and Munger value focus over diversification and prefer owning a few wonderful businesses to a diversified group of average businesses. They believe modern portfolio theory has no value and owning three wonderful businesses is safer and more profitable than owning 50 average ones.
168,https://youtu.be/ZJzu_xItNkY,ZJzu_xItNkY," My name is Mark Hake. I'm from Scottsdale, Arizona. And I am very interested in your policies on diversification and also how you concentrate your investments. And I've studied your annual reports going back a good number of years. And there's been years where you had a lot of stocks in your marketable, equitable securities portfolio. And there was one year where you only had three in 1987. So I have two questions. Given the number of stocks that you have in the portfolio now, what does that imply about your view of the market in terms of, is it fairly valued, that kind of idea? And second of all, whenever you, it seems that whenever you take a new investment, you never take less than about 5% and never more than about 10% of the total portfolio with that new position. And I wanted to see if I'm correct about that. Yeah, well, on the second point, that really isn't correct. We have positions which you don't even see because we only listed the ones above 600 million in the last report, and obviously those are all smaller positions. Sometimes that's because they're smaller companies and we couldn't get that much money in. Sometimes it's because the price has moved up after we bought them. Sometimes it's because we may be selling the position down even. So there's nothing magic. We like to put a lot of money in things that we feel strongly about. And that gets back to the diversification question. We think diversification as practice generally makes very little sense for anyone that knows what they're doing. Diversification is a protection against ignorance. I mean, if you want to make sure that nothing bad happens to you relative to the market, you own everything. There's nothing wrong with that. I mean, that is a perfectly sound approach for somebody who does not feel they know how to analyze businesses. If you know how to analyze businesses and value businesses, it's crazy to own 50 stocks or 40 stocks or 30 stocks probably because there aren't that many wonderful businesses that are understandable to a single human being in all likelihood. And to have some super wonderful business and then put money in number 30 or 35 on your list of attractiveness and forego putting more money into number one just strikes Charlie and me as madness. And it's conventional practice and it may, you know, if all you have to achieve is average, it may preserve your job, but it's a confession in our view that you don't really understand the businesses that you own. You know, I base, I mean, on a personal portfolio basis, you know, I own one stock, you know, but it's a business I know and it leaves me very comfortable. So, you know, do I need to own 28 stocks in order to have proper diversification, you know? It would be nonsense. And within Berkshire, I could pick out three of our businesses and I would be very happy if they were the only businesses we owned and I had all my money in Berkshire. Now, I love the fact that we can find more than that and that we keep adding to it, but three wonderful businesses is more than you need in this life to do very well. And the average person isn't going to run into that. I mean, if you look at how the fortunes were built in this country, they weren't built out of a portfolio of 50 companies. They were built by someone who identified with a wonderful business. Coca-Cola is a great example. A lot of fortunes have been built on that. And there aren't 50 Coca-Colas. You know, there aren't 20. If there were, it would be fine. Diversify like crazy among that group and get results that would be equal to owning the really wonderful one, but you're not going to find it. And the truth is you don't need it. I mean, if you have a really wonderful business, it's very well protected against the vicissitudes of the economy over time and competition. I mean, you know, we're talking about businesses that are resistant to effective competition, and three of those will be better than 100 average businesses. And they'll be safer, incidentally. I mean, there is less risk in owning three easy-to-identify wonderful businesses than there is in owning 50 well-known big businesses. And it's amazing what has been taught over the years in finance classes about that. But I can assure you that I would rather pick, if I had to bet the next 30 years on the fortunes of my family that would be dependent upon the income from a given group of businesses, I would rather pick free businesses from those we own than own a diversified group of 50. Charlie? You know, what he's saying is that much of what is taught in modern corporate finance courses is twaddle. You want to elaborate on that, Charlie? You cannot believe this stuff. It's modern portfolio theory. It has no utility. It will tell you how to do average, but I think anybody can figure out how to do average in fifth grade. It's just not that difficult. It's elaborate, and there's lots of little Greek letters and all kinds of things to make you feel that you're in the big leagues. But there is no value added. I have great difficulty with it because I am something of a student of dementia. We hang around a lot together. I like it ordinarily classified dementia on some theory structure of models, but the modern portfolio theory, it involves a type of dementia I just can't even classify. Something very strange is going on. If you find three wonderful businesses in your life, you'll get very rich. And if you understand them, bad things aren't going to happen to those three. I mean, that's the characteristic of it. By the way, maybe that's the reason there's so much dementia. If you believe what Warren said, you can teach the whole course in about a week.

I think a lot of people have difficulty valuing businesses because of some convoluted accounting schemes that are out there. Do you have any suggestions in terms of books or something you can read where you can sort of make sense of some of the accounting stories that are going around? Well, that's a good question. Abe Breloff used to write for Barron's quite frequently on various accounting machinations, and Barron's has continued that somewhat. But you're right that there are people out there who will try to paint pictures with accounting that are something far from the economic reality. And sometimes the rules of accounting themselves lead to that. I would say that when the accounting confuses you, I would just tend to forget about it as a company. I mean, it's probably, it may well be intentional, and in any event, you don't want to go near it. We have never had any great investment results from companies whose accounting we regarded as suspect. I can't think of a one. Can you tell me? No. It's a very bad sign. I made a short sale once that worked out well in a case like that. It really, accounting can be a, accounting can offer you a lot of insight into the character of management. And I would say there's a lot, you know, there's a, you run into a fair amount of bad accounting. You used to call it creative accounting, but you, and you probably run into a lot more if it was allowed. But some companies have been able to push their auditors pretty far. And I would be very skeptical of anything that looks suspicious to you. I think there have been, there have been a couple of things written, but I can't think of where they've appeared, where people talk about the questions of, you know, what, obviously, if some prepaid expense, deferred asset accounts start building up, suspiciously high, and inventories look out of line, you know, with sales and particularly the trend of them and all that. You want to look twice at companies like that. Life insurance, you know, frequently, you know, we see weak accounting in it. You can, when you don't have a product where revenues and expenses are being matched up on something close to cash in the short term, you have the opportunity for people playing games with numbers. And some people have learned how to do that very well, and they've sometimes created long-lasting stock manipulation or promotion schemes that have enriched themselves at the, or they've enriched the managers or the creators of it at the expense of the public over time. If you ever get suspicious about accounting, just go on to the next company.",Warren Buffett advises to be wary of suspicious accounting and avoid companies with questionable accounting practices. He suggests looking for businesses with matched up revenues and expenses close to cash.
170,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJzu_xItNkY,ZJzu_xItNkY,"My name is Mark Hake. I'm from Scottsdale, Arizona. And I am very interested in your policies on diversification and also how you concentrate your investments. And I've studied your annual reports going back a good number of years. And there's been years where you had a lot of stocks in your marketable, equitable securities portfolio. And there was one year where you only had three in 1987. So I have two questions. Given the number of stocks that you have in the portfolio now, what does that imply about your view of the market in terms of, is it fairly valued, that kind of idea? And second of all, whenever you, it seems that whenever you take a new investment, you never take less than about 5% and never more than about 10% of the total portfolio with that new position. And I wanted to see if I'm correct about that. Yeah, well, on the second point, that really isn't correct. We have positions which you don't even see because we only listed the ones above 600 million in the last report, and obviously those are all smaller positions. Sometimes that's because they're smaller companies and we couldn't get that much money in. Sometimes it's because the price has moved up after we bought them. Sometimes it's because we may be selling the position down even. So there's nothing magic. We like to put a lot of money in things that we feel strongly about. And that gets back to the diversification question. We think diversification as practice generally makes very little sense for anyone that knows what they're doing. Diversification is a protection against ignorance. I mean, if you want to make sure that nothing bad happens to you relative to the market, you own everything. There's nothing wrong with that. I mean, that is a perfectly sound approach for somebody who does not feel they know how to analyze businesses. If you know how to analyze businesses and value businesses, it's crazy to own 50 stocks or 40 stocks or 30 stocks probably because there aren't that many wonderful businesses that are understandable to a single human being in all likelihood. And to have some super wonderful business and then put money in number 30 or 35 on your list of attractiveness and forego putting more money into number one just strikes Charlie and me as madness. And it's conventional practice and it may, you know, if all you have to achieve is average, it may preserve your job, but it's a confession in our view that you don't really understand the businesses that you own. You know, I base, I mean, on a personal portfolio basis, you know, I own one stock, you know, but it's a business I know and it leaves me very comfortable.

So it's really cool that you kind of had that experience because now you can kind of talk through and help so many more people as you went through this process. What do you think some of the major things you did as you went forward were in terms of, you know, getting your finances together? I know you talk about the budget. You're the budget master when it comes to all this stuff. But are there anything else? Is there anything else that you think that you did over that timeframe? Because now you have, you know, a multimillion dollar net worth and you've got this thriving business and you're doing all these amazing things. So are there things you did along the way to kind of take yourself to the next step? Absolutely. In the beginning, the biggest thing wasn't actually financial. I was so hard on myself because I was just like, how could you make this mistake? Like Tiffany, you grew up learning about this. Are you dumb? Like I was talking to myself crazy in a way that I would never let anyone else talk to me. And if you are struggling with your finances, you might be talking to yourself in a way that you would never let anyone speak to you. And so I actually had to learn to forgive myself first and foremost. I had to say, you didn't kick anybody's puppy, Tiffany. You know, like you didn't rob and steal and you know, you didn't do those things. You messed up with your money. It happens. What really would help with that is I told my best friend Linda and I thought that she was going to be like, not Tiffany with the perfect financial record. And she was like, girl, me too. I'm at my mom's house right now. So she, because what Linda did for me was to show that one, I wasn't alone in the struggle. And so it gave me the permission I needed to let go of some of the shame and focus on solutions because shame really does shield solutions. So that was the first thing that I did. And then I had to just really get my whole financial life on paper. Who do I own? How much? What am I making? You know, like what are the interest rates on the debt that I have? Like I had to get it down on paper so I could start to create a plan that made sense. And the plan really is the same plan for everyone, which is, you know, you have to make money. You don't have to make multiple six figures or whatever, but you have to be making money. So I had to get that solidified first, Tiffany, because I was on unemployment during that time. I said, you have to figure out how you're going to make money. And then when I figured out how to make money, I have to figure out how to get my bills below what I make every month. You know, like there has to be something left over. In the beginning, it was literally $5 a month. I didn't care. It was just about like, this is the practice. If you could do five, one day you'll do 50. If you could do 50, one day you'll do 500. So I was like, okay, I'm making a little money. I'm living below my means. I'm saving a little something. And then I massaged that equation until I made a little more, you know, and I got my spending underway. Then I started to really look at my debt and started to restructure it. And I said, okay, who do I owe? And can I make deals? Can I see if I can get some of this interest down? You know, and so I started to restructure my debt. I didn't even think about credit at that time. I restructured my debt to lower what my monthly payments would be. And then I set it and semi-forget it, you know? And so that was really helpful. And then from there I was like, all right, you know, I learned to make even more. I mean, in the beginning it was babysitting. It was tutoring. It was doing, I used to do one-on-one financial education, like meetups with people. And so like slowly but surely, you know, I was figuring out ways to increase my income, and then I was able to save even more. And once I had enough save and my debt was automated, then I said, now you can start to look into investing, Tiffany, because if you're going to grow wealth, it can't just be you working. And so that's really the key. It's you have to make money. You have to somehow get your bills under what you're making. You have to be able to save some until you have enough for emergencies. Then you have to start thinking about what does it look like to grow your money outside of your own hands and going to work, and then working that system over and over, tightening up different parts of it, not ignoring your debt. Put yourself on a plan. Because when I did all those things, my credit score automatically started to go up, you know? And then slowly but surely, I got back on my feet, and then I really got good at making money. Like good, good at making money. Right. You know? And so, yeah, so that's where I am now. I still live those same principles, like I get better at making money. You know, I don't have to save anymore. I already have a year's worth of emergency savings saved. I get better at investing, you know? And I invest largely in my own company. I mean, I invest in the market, certainly in some real estate, but largely into my own companies. And so, like, you know, once I focused on that, I don't have any more debt. I mean, like I own two properties, I don't have a mortgage. I own a car, I don't have a car, no. I'm debt-free like a seven-year-old. You know? So I manage that debt. My credit score is back in the eight hundreds. And so it's the same process, whether it's broke Tiffany or wealthy Tiffany, I'm still living that same process, process, process, process.","Tiffany Aliche shares her experience of overcoming financial hardship and developing a net worth of millions of dollars.

With Ariana that a lot of people talk through what are some of the other struggles that some of the other coaches actually teach people? Throughout in the documentary So Ross Mackey is awesome. He had a professional tease professional athlete Tease who had gotten a ton of money a seven figure, you know Contract but and I wouldn't even say that he just blew it because it's not like he had a ton of like jewelry and things He purchased a home for his family and a home for his mother So a million dollars in the United States when it comes to homes doesn't go that far, right? You know, so Ross was teaching him really about investing So that was one of the things because tease was he was afraid to invest so he was spending More than he ought to have instead of setting aside money to grow his wealth. And so that was one of the things Mr. Money mustache. He had this couple that was high-earning You know, but they just were living too big of a life and like my dad would say that you cut your coat according to your size Right meaning that like whatever your budget is. That's what your life should look like, you know like this But they had they were wearing a coat that was too small, you know, because they had lived too fully So even though they're making a ton of money, they were spending even more and so mr. Money mustache really taught them about identifying the life that they could have if they live within their means and And if they did so, you know, which they did, you know, they sold their house. They like travel for three months I forgot what country they went to but it just was amazing to see their transformation. And then last Paula pant She's awesome her her woman. I think her name was Emily I can't remember that was her name, but she um, she was an artist and so she taught her how to lean into her creative juices and to use her art to Make more income because she was a bartender wasn't making much money And so she really taught her like okay her issue was she wasn't making enough So Paula really taught her how to tap into the skill set She already possessed that she loved doing to make more so it was just such a great well-rounded Group of people who needed help. So it was what I love most about the documentary I was worried that we were gonna have like a Simon Cowell You know, like one of the coaches was gonna be mean and rude Right, you know, but everyone was really generous and kind And helpful, you know And so if you haven't watched get smart with money not to be confused with my New York Times bestseller get good with money You ought to on Netflix. It's really just a great documentary You","The documentary ""Get Smart with Your Money"" on Netflix follows several individuals with different financial struggles as they work with expert coaches to transform their mindset and improve their financial situation. The coaches help them overcome challenges such as overspending, fear of investing, and not making enough income. The documentary provides practical advice on personal finance and emphasizes the importance of mindset in achieving financial success. The coaches are supportive and kind throughout the process.

173,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL0e3YzuzIY_sep_925_1165,FL0e3YzuzIY_sep_925_1165,"And I remember even the weekend that it came out, I had neighbors that live in my neighborhood that came because they know I have this podcast and they know that we talk about money and personal finance all the time. And they said, have you seen that documentary? It was amazing. So I had even so many people just coming and talking to me the weekend it came out. So it really has impacted a lot of people. And I think the impact is major. So if you haven't seen it, I highly, highly recommend it because it talks about so many different situations and you can probably unlock for a certain thing in your situation as well, but it can really help you as you go forward. Now in Get Smart With Money, you talk about some very cool ways to think about spending. And I really loved the way that you kind of frame this where you ask four questions before you spend money on something. Can you talk about those four questions and why they're significant? Yes. So those four questions are, do I need it? Do I love it? Do I like it? Do I want it? And those are your financial priorities in order. So your needs come first, right? So that's the things you have to have to be healthy, you know, and to be, to be able to take care of yourself, right? So things like food, shelter, medicine, transportation. And so you take care of your needs first because if not, you won't be here. So next really are things that people tend to skip over. Those are your loves. And to me, a love is something that a year from now or more, it will still bring you joy. So if you spend money, like say, like for me, I love to travel. I just got back from Kenya a few days ago. I love it. I skipped in a month. Before that, I was in Dubai. Before that, Bali. I love to travel. And places that I had been 20 years ago, I still remember fondly. So for me, travel is a love because it brings us lasting joy, right? And so, but people skip over those loves because sometimes it costs them more money. So they jump right to likes and wants. Likes six months from now, you won't even remember that thing. Maybe it's a dress. Maybe it's a pair of boots that you're just like, the first six months, the first few months you love them and then they're in the back of your closet. And so it doesn't mean you don't get likes. It just means that you're conscious that this is a temporary piece of joy and wants. There's no joy whatsoever. It's just an instant satisfaction. I have an addiction to like Burt's Bees lip gloss, right? I buy this stuff all the time, but I don't buy it and I'm not like, oh my gosh, I'm so grateful for this Burt's Bees. No, I just get it and I throw it in my bag and I lose it. You know? And so those are your wants. So the key is to live in the, as much as possible, in the need, love section of the equation. Because the more you spend on likes and wants, the less you have available to your needs and loves. So if I spend a lot of money, so I'll give you an example, like one of my friends, she likes to buy like, you know, like random like clothes and things from Target or whatever, which is fine, but she always says she wants to go on vacation with me and that she can't afford it. So every time like she would make a Target one and I would ask, oh, what'd you get? And she would go, I spent like a hundred bucks. I wasn't planning on it. So I started to write down, because I am the budgetnista, every time she told me that. And the next time I was going on vacation and she said I couldn't go, she couldn't go because she didn't have it, I was like, so don't be mad, but every time you went to Target, even if you didn't tell me how much you spent, I assumed at least it was a hundred dollars. And I added it up, you could be on vacation with me. If you know, this is like, there's like $1,500 worth of spending. She was like, what? She was like, you're so nosy, first of all, Tiffany, how are you adding up my Target? But because I said, those are your likes. I said, do you remember what you bought at Target six months ago? She's like, no. I said, but I remember my trip from six months ago. And so I don't believe in depriving yourself, you know, so I believe because this is not deprivation. I'm saying I want you to have the thing that means the most by letting go of the things that don't mean that much to you. And so, yeah, that has been transformative for me. Need it, love it, like it, want it. And this is one of the most powerful things that people can do. Think about how conscious conscious conscious conscious conscious conscious conscious conscious","In this conversation, the speaker discusses the impact of a documentary and shares her four-question approach to smart spending: ""Do I need it? Do I love it? Do I like it? Do I want it?"" She explains that needs should come first, followed by loves, which bring lasting joy, while likes are temporary sources of happiness and want to provide instant gratification. Tiffany encourages people to prioritize spending on needs and loves, rather than likes and wants, in order to have more resources available for what truly matters to them. This approach can help individuals avoid overspending on things that don't bring long-term satisfaction and can ultimately improve their financial well-being."
174,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL0e3YzuzIY_sep_1166_1600,FL0e3YzuzIY_sep_1166_1600,"yourself those four questions before you spent money on certain things. And Tiffany, we talk about this all the time in this podcast as well. We want you to spend lavishly on the things that bring you value and cut mercilessly on the things that don't bring you value. And it's exactly what these four questions do. They actually create the life that you want. What is your dream life? How can you create that life and how can you change your spending and use your budget so that you can actually steer it towards that dream life? And these questions actually craft that. And you and I are on the exactly on the same page on that as well. So I absolutely love this. That's why I loved it. When you said that it almost just kind of unlocked it. When I was watching the doctor, me like, that's amazing way to kind of think through this process so that you can see exactly where your dollars need to go and prioritize those dollars towards the things that you actually want in life. So I love that part of it as well. So as you went through this process with Ariana, you taught, you showed her, she paid off that $40,000 worth of debt, but you put together an automated system and automation is one of the most powerful things I think that you can do with your money is the best thing that we teach people very early on to start automate everything. So can you kind of talk about that automation system? And I'm sure this is going to help all different sorts of people out there, but that automation system is a really cool way to kind of get yourself out of debt. Can you kind of talk through that a little bit? Sure, Andrew. So I call it split it before you get it. If you can't tell that used to be a preschool teacher with all my sayings that you have that. And so I call it split it before you get it because it's well basically budget without budgeting, because not everyone like I like a spreadsheet, you know, like give me a spreadsheet, it's a good time. But not everyone likes that, you know, and that's okay. And so the teacher in me is like, okay, let me make sure every student is able to succeed. So the way split it before you get it works is that I mean, I had Ariana open five accounts, but at the very, at the bare minimum, there's four different accounts for this method to checking to savings. So checking account number one is your deposit account. You know, this is where, you know, um, you, when you get direct deposit, some of your money is going to land, but also this is where I like to say, you're going to keep your cash spending like your allowance. So if you get a haircut, you know, if you are buying clothes, groceries, anything that you would normally swipe your debit card for or pay cash with, that's what's going to stay in this initial checking account. Number one, checking account. Number two at that same bank is going to be your bills account, you know, so this is an account where you are going to calculate how much your bills are monthly. If you get paid twice a month, you know, make sure that that money is going into their bills account and then your bills account will automatically pay your bills. Uh, for you, ideally, if you don't think you're going to have enough, then you can manually pay your bills yourself whenever you need to. Now the key with your bills account is do not get a debit card with that checking. So they're always going to offer you a debit card with your checking account. And you think like, I have to have a debit card. You don't. You can literally say, I don't want a debit card. So when I get to swiping with my, with my debit card, I know I'm never spending bill money. I'm only ever spending the money that's in my deposit slash allowance account. So those are your two checking at your regular brick and mortar bank. Then you're going to have two savings. That's not going to be at that bank because savings should never be saved at these big banks because they give you 0.000000001%. Exactly. You're going to have your two savings at an online only bank. Right. And so, um, in a high yield savings account right now, I think like the highest, one of the highs I've seen is like 3.7% you know, around, you know, whenever you're listening to this, you know, before it was as that low, as low as 1% when I, I remember, I can't, it was like years ago, it was something crazy, like four or 5%. You know, when I first opened up my first high yield savings, but you're going to put savings account number one, this is going to be your emergency savings account. Now, a lot of people who are like, you know, love personal finance, sometimes they're like, but it's not making any money. The purpose of emergency savings is not to make you money. It is to be a safety net in case something happens. That's like saying, I don't want to wear my seatbelt. It's not cute. Like my Gucci belt. Exactly. It's like, that's not the point of a seatbelt. It's to protect you. Like you could get a Gucci belt separately from this, you know? And so like, this is your seatbelt account, your emergency savings. You know, you want to do at least three months of what I like to call your noodle budget. So your ramen noodle budget is if you took out the bells and whistles from your budget. So let's just say your life costs you $5,000 a month with haircuts, nails, whatever. But if you took out everything except for the essentials and you could get your budget down to $3,500, let's say, $3,500 times the three months, that's your noodle budget. That's what you're going to aim for in your savings account at minimum. Then you're going to look at your life and say, based upon the industry that I'm in, how quickly could I replace my income if I were to lose my job? If you're a nurse, for example, my mom used to be a nurse before she retired. Three months of emergency noodle budget save, it's plenty because she doesn't even need three months, honestly. Right. Because I remember like one time her hospital was closing and she must have gotten 50 calls a day because nurses then and now on high demand, you know? But my sister, who's an engineer, it took her almost two years to find her first job, you know, for the piece of mechanical engineer. So she might want to have six to 12 months worth of emergency savings, you know? So that's savings account number one, emergency savings. And the last savings account is your goal savings. I want to buy a car. I want to buy a house. I want to... So something that you're saving for in the next like six months to a year, anything beyond that, you might want to put it into like a CD or you might want to invest, you know, so that way it can grow. But if you're buying something within the next six months to a year, you know, you want to have it pretty liquid and available to you. And so that's your goal savings account. So deposit account slash allowance checking, bills checking, same bank, savings for emergencies, savings for goals, different high yield interest savings bank. If you have those four things set up, then you go to HR and payroll and say, hey, you know how you normally put all of my money in one account? Stop that. I want you to split it before I get it. So you're going to say, here are the amounts. When? And here's the thing. I, the budget needs to my company. It's not some huge company. We are able to split up to four ways. So the average company should typically be able to do this. If you can't, you can still do the transfers yourself. So they'll put that money in those four accounts for you. So you don't have to ask yourself, Andrew, like, oh gosh, do I have the money to pay my bills? Oh, it already landed. And my savings? It already landed. Oh, I'm swiping my card. Do I have the money? Well, whatever's on in your deposit account, that's the money you could spend on, on, on whatever it is your target run, because you know, it's not your savings. You know, it's not bills. And so you're like, this is the money that's designated. Like that is life changing. Split it before you get it because it just allows you the freedom and the autonomy with the money that you're allowed to use, however you like knowing everything else is taken care of. If for whatever reason your job says, we won't split, have everything land in your deposit account and then automate the splits, like if you get paid on the first and the 15th, automated on the second and the 16th and have it have your deposit account split for you. So that's yeah, that's that's yeah, that's that's yeah, that's that's yeah. That's that's yeah. That's that's yeah.","The speaker explains how to create a dream life by cutting mercilessly on things that don't bring value and spending on the things that do. They suggest using four questions to guide spending and create the life that you want. The speaker introduces ""split it before you get it"" as a way to automate finances and pay off debt. This method involves opening four or five bank accounts, including a deposit account, bills account, and two savings accounts. The speaker advises using an online bank for savings accounts and emphasizes the importance of an emergency savings account."

And I made this 10-step plan so everyone could know how quickly they were approaching what I call financial wholeness. And one of the components of financial wholeness is, yes, it is having financial help, whatever that looks like. So to start, you want to identify some accountability partners, people that you can start to practice having candid money conversations, whether it's your bestie, maybe you have a work husband, whether it's your work mom, your sister, your cousin, your dad. You want to start to have these normalized conversations. You could start with the good things if you want. Like, oh, I'm saving for vacation. And I'm going to, is it OK if I kind of like, because I want to be held accountable. And so is it OK if I just check in with you weekly to tell you, I have 50% down. I've got 60% down because that's easy. You know, like saving for vacation, everyone says, yay. Saving for a house, everyone says, yay. And then you might elevate the conversation and say, I'm going to pay down my debt. You know, do you want to do it alongside me? Let's make it like a thing that we do together, you know, so we could check in regularly to see how are we doing. They don't have to be a financial expert. They're just someone who also wants to get on financial track. So those conversations you start to have. But then also having conversations about how much are you making, right? So if you're wanting to get a job someplace and you have to start to have that conversation because you want to make sure that what they're offering you for pay is what's equitable, what they're offering everyone else. So starting to have those candid conversations, it doesn't have to be with people at your job, but it could be colleagues at a company that's similar, similar size, to say, so what are they paying over there? You know, asking those things before you even need to know. So you want to integrate normalized talk about money. But it's your tone. I grew up in a household, we talked about money all the time. I didn't have money shame until I got into my 20s and I made my own mistakes. But because my dad talked about money, like it was like easy breezy, you know, like even though I grow up now, I'm like, wait, we had we were pretty broke. Now I think back on it, but that was never the energy that he brought to the table. So even as you're speaking about money with the people in your life, the energy that you bring to the table are how they're going to that's how they're going to receive it. And so because you cannot go through it alone, you need an accountability partner, depending on like where you are in life, you might want to have a certified financial planner. Not everyone necessarily needs one. Certainly when I got to a certain level of wealth, I had taken myself as far as I could take myself. So I hired like a certified financial planner that was also a wealth planner because I was just like, I have all this money and I know basic investing and I can I bought real estate but it's getting beyond even what I'm capable of managing. And so she helped, you know, I have an accountant, you know, you may or may not need my dad was an accountant. And so I did my taxes for the first like 30 years of my life. And then when terminal tax came out, everyone could do their own, you know, taxes. But if you have a business or maybe you have multiple properties or things like that, then you might want to have, you know, accountant, like I have a I have an attorney because I have businesses. And so she's not on retainer, but it's someone who I know I can tap into the same. Hey, here are some contracts I need you to look at financial contracts. Here are like I'm taking one of my businesses, my online school, the Libertor Academy from an S Corp to a C Corp. But that's something I had to tell my attorney about like, and the accountant about like if I take my, you know, like what's the tax ramifications from growing an S Corp to a C Corp. And the attorney was like, well, here's what I think. And then my financial planner was like, here's what's going to be for your bottom line, Tiffany. So that whole team came together to help me make the right choice. And so you don't have to have those people, but it at the very least have an accountability partner and as your finances grow, not being afraid to ask for help for people that this is what they do so you can reach out and make sure you're making the right choices. I absolutely love that. And I think, you know, the coolest part about this is your father planted the seed early and he kind of talked about money with you and you kind of went through this whole process where he planted that seed and then look how many people's lives you're impacting now just for him talking about money all the time. And then once you got to that point where your wealth started to grow, then you put that team together around you, which is one of the most powerful things. I think my, like, for example, my accountant, my tax strategist is one of the best investments I make every single year because they save me so much money when it comes to tax strategy and accounting. It's just incredible. So just kind of doing these things is one of the most powerful things that you can do and just kind of normalizing talking about money. There's a lesson here on what your dad did because what he did was he talked to his kids about money. So if you're a parent out there, this is one of the best things that you can do. I've already started to do this with my four year old, for example, we're talking about money. My favorite party trick. I was just telling Andy Hill this the other day. My favorite party trick is that with my son, I like to have him, you know, tell the whole party what an asset is, what a liability is, and kind of go through that whole thing at four years old. So it's one of those things where it's just learning to kind of talk through this, normalizing it with your children as well can be very, very powerful. So I absolutely love that. And your program, you know, surrounding financial wholeness is one of my favorite things. And when I read the book, I really love the way the way the way the way the way the way","Tiffany, the author of ""Get Good with Money,"" stresses the importance of having financial help in achieving financial wholeness. One of the first steps to achieving financial wholeness is to identify accountability partners with whom one can have candid money conversations. These can be anyone from friends to family members, and conversations can start with topics such as saving for vacation or paying down debt. It is important to normalize talking about money to eliminate money shame. Depending on where one is in life, it may be necessary to have a certified financial planner, an accountant, or an attorney to help manage finances. It is crucial to have a team to reach out to for help as finances grow, and not to be afraid to ask for assistance. Building a team around oneself is one of the most powerful things one can do to achieve financial success."
176,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL0e3YzuzIY_sep_2011_2395,FL0e3YzuzIY_sep_2011_2395,"You talk about a lot of things in the financial wholeness program that a lot of other people don't talk about, which I like as well. So can you kind of talk about the components of financial wholeness? No, absolutely. So I came up with, I used to always like kind of preach financial freedom, financial freedom. But honestly, Andrew, I started to realize not everyone's going to have enough money to not have to work anymore. You know what I mean? And I just like, I love the fire movement. I mean, I'm fired. I don't have to work anymore. So I'm not anti that. It's just the teacher in me is always, I want to be able to teach a lesson that every student can master. And so I was like, there's plenty of fired people. There's plenty of financial freedom people. But are there enough people that say, if you don't reach those things, can you still be OK financially? Can you still go on vacation? Can you still make sure you're OK, your family's OK? And so financial wholeness is this 10 step system that says, if you master these 10 steps, that even if you don't get your lump sum of money at the end of the rainbow, you will still be OK. You will still be able to take care of yourself, your family, and to enjoy life and use your finances as a tool. And so these 10 steps are first, it's budgeting, because that's super important. Absolutely. Then saving, then debt, then mastering your credit, then learning to earn. It's all about your income. Then it's investing for both retirement and wealth. Then it's insurance, because a lot of people neglect that. Then it's your net worth and increasing it. Then your financial professionals picking your money team. And then estate planning, leaving a legacy. So those are the 10 components. And so to your point, a lot of people, when I hear people talk about personal finance, they leave out insurance. They leave out estate planning. We all focus on the budgeting and the credit. But there is a more holistic view to your personal finances. Like at one point, it's possible to be wealthy and not financially whole. That's why I got my financial planner, Anjali, because I had grown wealth, and I was not financially whole. I did not know I was severely underinsured. She was like, Tiffany, you have next to no insurance. I'm like, no, I do. She's like, yeah, but you bought this when you were 26. At the time, I was 38. She's like, now you're 30. This is not enough. That was for preschool teacher Tiffany. You are now millionaire business owner, Tiffany. If someone were to sue you, girl, it's a wrap for you. And so I was like, OK, so what do I do? So we increased my insurance. Estate planning, I didn't have an estate planning. I was like, oh, I'm young. I don't need a will. I don't need it. No, now I have a will. Now I have a trust. Because as my wealth has grown, it's like if something happens to me, I don't want my family scrambling, because I have multiple businesses. I don't want them scrambling to try to figure out, what do I want, what are my wishes? And so my trust, a will, really helps people to understand what you want as soon as you're not here. And a trust allows you to say, into the future, here's what I want to happen with my assets and my estate. I have in my trust, I have nieces and nephews that are really young. No one's over the age of seven. So I'm like, a seven-year-old, Roma does not need $200,000 right now. But when he's 18, here's a payout. When he's 25, there's a payout. When he's 30, there's the final payout. So a trust allows you to do that. So yeah, I really worked so hard on Get Good with Money, because I wanted to answer the core questions that people have when it comes to their finances. Like, what do I do to be OK? And I hope that it answers that question, and then some. It absolutely does. And what it really does is, like you're right, a lot of people can be OK with money. They can get to financial freedom even, but they're not financially whole. And that's the part that kind of is the light bulb moment for a lot of people, because having financial wholeness is having all of these components in place, and understanding that things can happen to you, especially like with the insurance and estate planning parts. Things can happen to you that you don't expect. And if you don't have some of these things in place, it can really unravel your financial independence, essentially. So having this in place, having all the protection in place as well, but then having the core basics of personal finance all wrapped into one book is absolutely amazing. That's what I loved about some of these principles as well. Do you think there's an order? Like, say somebody's just starting out. Do you think there's an order they should focus on early on? And then do you kind of build from there? What is your perspective on that? Is there like a specific order of operations when you look at financial wholeness? Yeah. So I wrote it in that way. So the teacher in me was very conscious that I said, I want the beginner to know, start here, move through. But then I want someone who's more advanced, who doesn't need that stuff, to be able to jump to what they needed and to be able to not need the prior chapters to get this chapter. So I wrote each chapter almost like it was an individual book, but then they build upon each other if that's what you need. So first things first, just like we talked about earlier, Andrew, is financial wholeness, we start with mindset in the book. It's not one of the specific steps, but it's like we do a little primer in the beginning. But yeah, absolutely, it's the first five steps. It's budgeting, it's savings, it's debt, it's credit, it's learning to earn. Just like we talked about, how did I get on my feet? Those same five principles in order, that's where I would suggest people start. And then once you have those things, or if you already have those things, then yes, you can jump into investing, looking at your insurance, net worth. Now here's the thing that's so great is that as you do the core things, the other things will raise. It's like a rising tide lifts all boats. So it's not like, I'm budgeting so I'm not going to look at investing. No, as you budget, you're releasing money so that way you can maybe max out at your 401K. As you're saving, you're like, OK, I have enough. Because I'm saving, my net worth is increasing. And so by the time you get to the second half of the book and the second five steps in financial wholeness, you have already worked through so many of them just by default. Exactly. That's what I love too is that when you go through the book and you look through each and every chapter, you can see, say I'm struggling with a specific part of this. You can read that chapter in and of itself, and you can learn and take away so much from it. You don't have to go through the entire thing in order, and you can figure out exactly what you need there as well. So I love that part of it, that people can reference it and go back and reference through it and understand it. You almost use it like a manual as well. So that part is really, really cool. And so I'd be remiss without asking you, since you are so incredible when it comes to budgets, you have some really cool systems in place.","In this conversation, Tiffany Aliche, author of ""Get Good With Money,"" discusses her philosophy of financial wholeness, which includes 10 components: budgeting, saving, debt, credit, earning, investing, insurance, net worth, professionals, and estate planning. She emphasizes that financial wholeness is achievable even without achieving financial freedom and that all 10 components are important to master, with budgeting and saving being the foundational steps. She also advises beginners to start with budgeting and saving and progress from there."
177,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL0e3YzuzIY_sep_2396_2615,FL0e3YzuzIY_sep_2396_2615,"but you have these things called control categories. Can you talk about those control categories and why they're powerful in your budget? So yeah, so I, that was my favorite chapter because you know, I'm the budget least. Yeah. So, so the control categories for your budget. So I tell people, when you start to budget, create what I call a money list, which is just a list of all of your expenses and everything that you make. So you can kind of see, this is what I make, this is what I spend, and you want to have it within a month time period. So that way you can say, this is what I make in a month, this is what I spend in a month. And then next to everything that you're spending, then here are the like the, there are letters that you put next to everything. So first I like people to start with the obvious thing, your B's, bills. So you put a B next to all of your bills. These are basically like, for the most part, fixed expenses month after month, you know, you're probably going to have more B's than anything else. So your car, no, no insurance policies, maybe mortgage, rent, whatever, you're going to put B's next to those, you know, and then you're going to ask yourself, what are these things that, you know, there are bills that are not always fixed. So things that kind of fluctuate based upon your usage. And so any B that is not always fixed, you're going to put a U next to that B. So I like to call that like, that U stands for usage or up and down, you know, like these bills fluctuate or based upon your usage. So these are your UB's, you know? And then anything else that's left over, you put a C next to, those are your cash expenses. These are not things that you necessarily use cash for, but these are things where you have the most amount of control. You know, that's what that C stands for as well. So B's are always first, you put those B's, then your UB's, then whatever's left over are your C's. Now here's why it's so important to do that activity, is because when it's time to cut, well, first of all, I tell people, based upon your money list and your B's, your UB's and your C's, I can tell you what kind of issue you have if you don't have enough money. I can tell you if you have a don't make enough issue or spend too much issue. If you add up all your C's and they are more than your B's and UB's, you have a spend too much issue. Because those are all these cash expenses. So it's like you are overspending, good to know. If you add up all your B's and UB's and it's more than your cash expenses, then you likely have a don't make enough issue. So it's like now we gotta start thinking about how we can bring in income. The reason why this is so important, Andrew, is that without fail, everyone does the opposite of what they should do when they need to make more money or save money. If I'm like, okay, Andrew, you need to save more money and you are already frugal, you have like three C's. Because you're frugal, if I tell you, you don't have enough money at the end of the month, you need to get more money at the end of the month, the instant thing you're gonna do is to try to save even more because that's what you know best. And that's not the issue. The issue is you need to make more. You have way more B's than UB's. So looking at that, I can say, no, no, no, no. Don't fake focus on being more frugal, focus on making more. But if you're someone who is like, you have a ton of C's and I'm like, okay, Andrew, you need to have more money at the end of the month. And you're like, you know what, I'm just gonna make some more money. That's not gonna actually fix it because you're just gonna add more C's. You know, you're just gonna add more cash expenses. And so that activity really helps to see if I don't have enough money at the end of the month, where should I be focusing my energy? And if you do that, then you're gonna be way more likely to stick to it and to see success. And what I love about that is you just, it teaches people to really, most people don't know what they need to do next. And a lot of times it will show them exactly what you need to do next. It's almost like a personality, like a personality, like a personality, like a personality.","In this conversation, Tiffany Aliche, also known as The Budgetnista, discusses the importance of control categories in budgeting. She advises creating a money list of all expenses and income within a month's time period, then categorizing expenses with letters next to them: B for bills, UB for bills that fluctuate based on usage, and C for cash expenses with the most amount of control. Analyzing the total amount of each category can help determine if there's a don't make enough issue or spend too much issue. This helps to focus on the right solution, either making more money or reducing spending in certain categories."

I can't cut back anymore. I've cut back as much as I possibly can. I've got to increase my income so that I can make more and live the life that I want. So there's just so many cool things about doing that exercise. And I love that exercise and kind of thinking through that as well. So that's a major, major cool part about the book as well. So Tiffany, I want to shift gears here because we have some questions and they get a little deeper than this that we ask a lot of our guests and we get some really cool answers out of these as well. So the first one is what part of your worker life makes you come alive? Teaching, I love teaching. I don't care what it is. I can teach you how to clip your toenails. I can teach you how to do like I just I was a preschool teacher because I love teaching. I started the budget because I love teaching. Like I could teach to an empty room. It's just it's the thing that makes me come alive and I will always teach whether it's this or something else. But yeah, I love sharing knowledge. And that comes completely through because you make really complex, you know, situations become very, very simple. So I absolutely love that. The second one is what is your biggest fear when it comes to money? My biggest fear when it comes to money is I'm going to I'm going to squander it. I'm such a hoarder. Like I'm gotten better. My financial advisor is like you don't spend enough, Tiffany, even in business. Like my CFO was like, Tiffany, we are 80 percent profit. I'm like, that's good. She's like, it's not good. It's not good. It's too much profit because you're literally giving half to the federal government. I'm like, I'm going to spend more on the business, Tiffany, like because I am so good at budgeting that like because really it's from a place of fear. I have a call post traumatic broke syndrome. And so, yeah, that's one of my biggest fears. Although I'm working through it and I'm better than I used to, we're not 80 percent profit anymore. We're 50, which is good. And so but yeah, so definitely my fear is like going back to being broke because that was a really hard time. And I think a lot of us like I started with with zero dollars as well. Like when I first I lived paycheck to paycheck and I think a lot of people that started from that point, they kind of feel that. So it kind of tightened up sometimes, which is.","In the interview, Tiffany discussed the importance of setting financial priorities. She emphasized the value of tracking expenses and creating a budget to identify areas where one can cut back or increase income. Aliche's passion for teaching financial literacy stems from her belief that it can be made simple and accessible to everyone. She also shared her fear of squandering money due to past financial struggles and she spends less on her business, but has overcome it by working with a financial advisor and budgeting effectively."
179,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tn3GuyzRDtg_sep_177_454,tn3GuyzRDtg_sep_177_454,"as well, where you talk about the different ways to actually access your retirement funds early. And we've done a couple of episodes on some of these, but I think, you know, going through all of these options, people can kind of weigh them out for their own personal situations. They can see which ones actually work for them. So I want to kind of go through these and we can kind of talk about them back and forth and kind of see what we, you know, kind of think through this process as well. And I think there's different ways for people to access their funds, whether they're in their thirties or their forties or their fifties and kind of the age range that they kind of think through that as well. And the first one is one that a lot of people think of, and this is one where I think it's where most people go to. And a lot of people think this is the only option available to them if they want to retire earlier, if they want to pursue financial independence or fire or whatever else. And that is the brokerage account. So can you talk through the brokerage account, maybe for new investors who don't even know what that is? Yes. But before I do, I want to ask you a question. So this is one of my, I'm sure this is true for you too, my most frequently asked questions, which is I don't want to lock up all my money inside of IRAs and 401ks. What if I want to retire early? How do I get access? I get asked all the questions, ask that question all the time. I think you do too, which is why we're talking about this, but let me ask you this. Right. How many times have you been asked that question by someone who is about to retire early? Like they say, I have millions of dollars. I theoretically could retire early, but unfortunately my hands and my money is tied because it's all locked inside of 401ks and IRAs. How often is like, has it actually become a problem? And then you hear that question. I don't think I've ever had that question ever. And if we have, it's very, very rare. Me either. Me either. And so this question, and I feel like we should go through all the options because I think we're going to soothe people's minds, but this question comes from people who are earlier in their investing journey and have this kind of unfounded fear of locking their money up. And the reality is, is like, you and I, we hear from a lot of people in this world, and I've never actually heard of that problem either. And so, and before we break down these six options, the thing that is like locking it up that people are so afraid of is a 10% penalty. And so let's say you had $4 million in a Roth IRA and you've done everything you're supposed to do, you maxed out every year, the investments have done wildly well, whatever, whatever. And then you're like, oh no, it's locked up. And then you said you're going to do the worst possible thing and withdraw every single penny of all $4 million today in one calendar year, the worst possible thing, even though you have decades of life ahead and you'd normally be spreading out. And a lot of it would be after you're 59 and a half, but you do the worst possible thing. What would happen is you'd have $3.6 million in cash in your checking account. This is the worst case scenario of locking your money up. And so I give that context because when people ask me this, I kind of like grab them by their shirt collar and shake them back and forth very violently and be like, this isn't that big of a deal. Invest early and often take the tax break when you can get it. If you happen to be in a great situation where you can retire early, I promise you, you'll be fine. Worst case scenario, you take the 10%. But I've also never talked to someone who's actually taking a 10% because of these six options. So is that a fair preface to this list we're about to go through? It absolutely is. And one other thing I can note here is we've actually done the math on this. A lot of times where we looked at the breakdown of that 10% penalty and a lot of times because of some of the tax benefits, you still come out ahead even if you have to take that 10% penalty hit. So a lot of people who are worried about this, in a lot of situations, it's not every situation, but in a lot of situations you could still come out ahead even with the penalty in front of you on some of those tax breaks. So it's interesting once you go through the math to see where people will land. But that's perfect. So I think that's a perfect preface as well. Yeah. I think we're trained to be rule followers in school and you get in trouble and penalty sounds like you're going to jail or being naughty. And the reality is like, yeah, of course you don't want to lose money on a penalty. You don't want to lose money on anything. But like you said, if you do the math, it's not that big of a deal. And like I said, even if you're going to the most extreme case and withdrawing everything in a day, it's still, you're going to have a lot of money and you're going to be fine. So yeah. Exactly. And that's exactly how people should really be thinking about it. Because once you start to build up wealth and you really have that big large nest egg, like you said, $4 million in place, it's just a minimal impact in comparison to everything else you should be focusing on. So I think that's, that's one major caveat. And I'm glad you brought that up because I think that's absolutely, absolutely, absolutely, absolutely.","There are six different ways to access retirement funds early, and one of them is the brokerage account. While it is a popular option, it is not the only one available. People often worry about locking up their money in 401(k)s and IRAs and not having access to them when they want to retire early. However, the only penalty for early withdrawals is a 10% penalty, which is not that significant. In the worst-case scenario, withdrawing all the money in one calendar year would result in 90% of the balance remaining. Therefore, locking up money in a retirement account is not a big issue, and people should take advantage of tax benefits while investing."
180,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tn3GuyzRDtg_sep_455_715,tn3GuyzRDtg_sep_455_715,"So yeah, like this first one here is the brokerage account. This is one most people think of. They think it's their only option. And so most people will consider not even investing in their 401ks and their IRAs, like you said, because they think they can't access it. They don't want to take that penalty. So they try to go for only the brokerage account only. So can you kind of talk through the brokerage account first and maybe what it is as well? Yeah, you know, I hear both kinds of confusion. One is that people, you know, we talk so much about your Roth IRA and I think we talk about it because it's a good place to start. It offers tax free growth, but you are limited, you know, this year to $6,500 in contributions. And so sometimes I hear people say, what if I want to invest more than $6,500? And you know, they're kind of like got themselves into like a little specialty account, which is the Roth IRA, but they're missing the general type of account, which is called a brokerage account. It's just like a checking account or savings account. But checking and savings accounts only hold cash. A brokerage account can hold investments like stocks and bonds. And just like a checking and savings account, you can put money in and out of your brokerage account whenever you want for any reason. There's no restrictions whatsoever. You know, the trade off there is you do pay tax on the gains, which again, isn't a huge problem. You know, you pay tax on your income, you pay tax when you buy things. That's just part of life. And so it's not quite as tax optimal as things like IRAs and 401ks, but it's got the ultimate flexibility, no income limits, no contribution limits, no withdrawal penalties or withdrawal timelines or restrictions on what you can invest in. It's the ultimate flexibility. And generally, when you're paying tax on investments, you're paying capital gains tax, usually long term capital gains tax. And there's actually a minimum income required to pay any that that rate's actually zero percent below forty thousand bucks or so of income for an individual or eighty thousand as a couple. So, for example, if you this option one we're talking about now is a brokerage account. If you just say, I'm going to eschew all these fancy named IRA, 401k, 403, BTSP, I'm going to screw all those different accounts. I'm just going to put it all under a regular brokerage account. And you and say you're married, you and your spouse could take out eighty thousand dollars a year, one hundred percent tax free and capital gains. And the other thing about brokerage accounts is people who do retire early generally are like saving a lot and they save more than that can fit into IRAs and 401ks. And so the overflow just has to go in a brokerage account. And so when I asked you the beginning, like, have you actually seen someone with this problem? The answer is no, because people who get there, once they start getting serious about saving and investing, they have a lot of overflow money in a brokerage account. And so let's say you're 50 years old and you have nine and a half year window before we can start accessing your retirement accounts. The first obvious place to go is just to the brokerage account because you could just take money out. Like you put it in a few years earlier. And so, yeah, that's option one. It's a great option. Exactly. And I think that is one of the one of the easiest options for a lot of people, too. It's kind of the default one as well. I know we're going to get this question. So I'm going to ask this as well. Is there a favorite brokerage account you have or a favorite list of brokerage accounts that you like to invest in? You know, the big the US is an amazing place to invest right now because fees are incredibly low. Technology is really good. Investment options are great. You know, if you go back 40 years, there's kind of a pain in the butt to like make an investment. You have to like go to like a stockbroker and you have to have minimums. There's a bunch of fees involved. It's kind of like this rich boys club or whatever. Now it's like, you know, Robin Hood has made the easiest app ever. Robin Hood is not my favorite. The big three are Vanguard, Fidelity and Schwab. I think if anyone suggests Vanguard, they have your best interests in mind because they're kind of built around the idea of low fee investments that, you know, do the best for the investor. I also like the new wave of robo advisors like Betterment or Betterment and Wealthfront. They charge a small fee, but they also help protect you from, you know, some typical human mistakes from the more complex brokerages like the first three. There's other ones like M1, like Robin Hood and E-Trade, TD Amerit. I mean, I'm listening a ton, but, you know, the big three Vanguard, Fidelity and Schwab should probably be the first three you look at. Absolutely. I agree. And I think Vanguard and Fidelity and Schwab are the three that I would I would say as well. Those are my three favorites by far. Vanguard was one of the first ones I opened. That's where my Roth IRAs and all that kind of stuff as well. And they really have investors' interest at heart, which is what I like about them. So definitely those are the best three. And I think that's just kind of the best option to go with. They have so many different options as well.","A brokerage account is an investment account that can hold various types of securities such as stocks and bonds, and is a flexible option because it has no contribution limits, no withdrawal penalties, no restrictions on what you can invest in, and no income limits. However, gains on investments in a brokerage account are taxable. Capital gains tax, usually long-term capital gains tax, is typically imposed on investments in a brokerage account, but there is a minimum income required to pay that tax rate, which is zero percent below $40,000 of income for an individual or $80,000 for a couple. The big three brokerage accounts in the US are Vanguard, Fidelity, and Schwab, which offer low fees and good investment options. There are also robo-advisors such as Betterment and Wealthfront, which charge a small fee but can help protect investors from typical human mistakes."

Now I've invested in real estate for a while as well, and real estate I think is a fantastic option for a lot of people. And a lot of people become financially independent by investing in real estate and figuring out how much money they need in cashflow and all that other stuff as well. So why is this a great option for people who wanna access funds early? Just like most people who are on pace for early retirement have money in a brokerage account, they generally end up with some real estate too because it's a good investment. I invest in exactly two things. Generally I invest in things that pay income while you own it and are likely to go up in value. So if it doesn't meet those two qualities, I don't invest in it. I don't invest in crypto, I don't invest in gold, I don't invest in oil, all that stuff is speculative stuff you hear a lot of news about. But I invest in things that pay me while I own them and go up in value. And if you buy and hold these things, they're paying you money, you can take that money and buy more, and then you get that compound growth, become super wealthy. Most people who are on this trajectory end up with some real estate. And that real estate is generally not contained within a tax advantaged account. You can technically put real estate inside of an IRA or something like that. It's a little bit more complicated, but generally people don't just because it's easier just to buy a house and give them the money or whatever. And then the nice thing about real estate is it also generally has pretty good cashflow relative to like an index fund or something, which is mostly most of the gains is usually in share price, not in cashflow. And so again, if you're like in your 40s or 50s, you're looking to cover that gap before you're 59 and a half, you might have a couple of rental properties maybe kicking off a thousand bucks a month to a couple of thousand bucks a month. Then that's really the first place you go for cash to live on because that cash is gonna get taxed no matter what. And so you might as well just spend that. And so yeah, just like people who are on their wealth building journey usually end up with a brokerage account, they usually end up with some investment real estate that's also not generally protected by this like tax advantage account penalty. You're exactly right. And a lot of people who have retired early, you talk to a lot of them, they either have a couple of properties or that's like their main strategy is kind of going in that direction. And it's just interesting to see how they kind of diversify. It's a great way to diversify your portfolio overall as well. And I think it's just a cool, cool way to kind of go about this. And the math is pretty easy. So that's kind of the next question I wanna ask you here is what are some ways that you can kind of use real estate to fund your lifestyle? To fund your lifestyle? Well, I mean, you spend a certain amount of money per year, right? And the general number for early retirement that is oft quoted is 25 times your annual spending. And so what that means is your investment portfolio that has to be 25 times your annual spending. But if you can replace that spending with income, then you can basically get to just a cashflow retirement situation. So like, let's say you wanna spend $80,000 a year and your properties are kicking off $40,000 a year in income, that's like after all the expenses and everything, then you only really need to like cover that $40,000 in other investments. So it's a great way to generate income. It's not for everyone, it's more work for sure. I personally own some real estate, but mostly index funds. I just think that my time is better spent working digitally than handling calls from tenants and stuff. But yeah, you can't argue, like you said, when you see young retirees, there's like very often real estate part of their plan. And I agree as well. I'm glad you brought up the non-passive side of it because it is much less passive for sure. Then even if you have a property manager in place, a lot of times with real estate, you still will have to manage that property manager. So there's a lot of extra hours and work involved in addition to going and finding those properties as well. But the easy way to do this is if you figure out how to run the numbers on rental properties, you can see how much cashflow you need. And if you do the 25X rule, then you can look at that and say, well, hey, if I can cover $40,000 in our example here and I could cover $40,000 in cashflow, then I only need another million dollars invested into something like index funds and ETFs, or then I can draw that down at 4%. So it kind of can reduce the amount of cashflow you need in retirement as well. And it's a great way to diversify that way. Or you can even fund your own lifestyle and figure out, hey, I spent $80,000 a year, will I need enough properties where that can actually fund my monthly lifestyle that way with cashflow. So it's another interesting way to do this. Also, you get those tax benefits and some of the other extra things as well. So I love that one. Number three is the...","The conversation is about financial strategies for early retirement, and the topic of investing in real estate is discussed. The hosts and guests agree that real estate can be a great investment option for generating income and diversifying one's portfolio. The 25X rule is mentioned, where one's investment portfolio should be 25 times their annual spending, and investing in rental properties can help to generate the necessary income to cover living expenses. However, it is noted that investing in real estate can require more work than other investment options, and it is important to understand the non-passive side of it. Overall, real estate can be a valuable addition to an investment portfolio for those pursuing financial independence and early retirement."
182,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tn3GuyzRDtg_sep_985_1168,tn3GuyzRDtg_sep_985_1168,"principle and a lot of people don't know this exists if they're new to investing or they're they're starting out Very early on in retirement accounts. So can you explain how to use your Roth IRA contributions and maybe talk about the five-year rule as well? sure, so again people new to investing are afraid of like locking up their money, but it's not really as locked up as you think and so For example up until last year you could put six thousand dollars or the last several years You could put six thousand dollars into a Roth IRA. So like let's say you did that for ten years Ten years times six thousand dollars is sixty thousand dollars. Now, let's say over the course of that ten years The investments have doubled in value. So now you have a hundred and twenty thousand dollars The rule of the Roth IRA is you can always for any reason with no tax no penalty withdraw What you put in so in that hundred twenty thousand dollar account sixty thousand of it is your principle That's your contributions. You can take that out whenever you want for any reason and so You know, it's it's no more locked away than money your savings account is but it's also generating this growth for you along the way That said I think it's good to know this rule. I've never seen someone use it for a good reason You know usually when people want to take money of a Roth IRA it's for a bad reason like They're trying to like buy a car or something You know not like oh my gosh, I've got so much I'm gonna retire early You know Like I said the typical scenario is once you get going on this and you feel traction All these accounts get big and then you you treasure that money, you know, so I'll give you not just a fictitious example I'll give you a real example of my personal wealth My net worth now is about four point five million dollars or so about I'd have to look up but I think about three hundred thousand or so is in IRAs and 401ks and 4.2 million dollars is not You know This is an extreme example because I made my money all very quickly in one year when I sold my company not all It but a lot of it But most people are just over have too much to fit into these accounts And so rather than worried about this little amount of money that they want to get out what they what the real concern is How do you get more money in and leave it in and so sure you should know that you can take out the Roth IRA principle whenever you want but in reality don't leave it alone. Let it grow let that grow for a long time You'll be you know, if you're fifty nine and a half years old the actuarial tables say you probably have you know twenty thirty years of life left on average and You're gonna want to use that money then for those decades and so you can use the other money before that like in your brokerage account Exactly. I've never seen it taken out For a good reason either it kind of reminds me of the Charlie Munger quote never interrupt compound interest I'm necessarily and that's a lot of times what people are doing when they do that So it's one of those things that I definitely think it's good to know and it's good to have that in place It's gonna help with our next one, too But at the same time just understanding that you shouldn't touch it unless you truly truly truly need it and then the other thing to note is there was also the Roth 401k as well which a lot more employer sponsored plans are Opening up to a lot of people so that's another cool one that you can look at if you want to get more dollars into Something like a Roth That's another way to look at that look at that look at that look at that look at that look at that look at that look at That look at that look at that","The discussion focused on personal finance and investing. The guest shared his experience with investing and highlighted the importance of starting early, diversifying, and keeping a long-term perspective. He emphasized the benefits of using retirement accounts, such as the Roth IRA, and how they can provide tax-free growth and withdrawals. The guest also provided practical advice for budgeting and reducing expenses, including finding ways to increase income and automating savings. Overall, the discussion provided useful insights and tips for individuals looking to improve their financial situation and build wealth over time."
183,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tn3GuyzRDtg_sep_1169_1576,tn3GuyzRDtg_sep_1169_1576,"And then number four is the Roth conversion ladder. Now, the Roth conversion ladder is one that we've had an episode on, and I love this one just for a lot of people. There's been some great work on that from people in the financial independence industry as well, just kind of looking at this one. So can you tell us how the Roth conversion ladder works? Yes. And I didn't answer your question about the five-year rule earlier, but I'll answer now because it's topical. So the rule of the Roth is that you can take out what you put in at any time for any reason. And the reason that's the rule is because that money has already been taxed. And so the government's like, hey, we've already taxed you on this. This isn't in money jail anymore. You can take out what you put in. There's another way to get money into a Roth, which is converting traditional IRA or 401K money into Roth. And so when you contribute to a traditional 401K or a traditional IRA, that money goes directly from your employer into that account without being taxed. Let's say you made $50,000 a year, you put $5,000 into a traditional 401K, you're only taxed as though you made $45,000. That $5,000 goes straight in. Now let's say you leave that company, you've got $5,000 or let's call it $10,000. It's doubled the value in that 401K. And you want to put it into your Roth IRA. You can convert it. That means basically transferring it from your traditional 401K into your Roth IRA. But since that money has never been taxed before, it went straight from your employer into that account. You have to pay tax on that, which is okay, because everything is, you know, all of our income is taxed. We're just paying the income tax when you convert it. But then you end up with this situation where this newly converted money is in your Roth IRA. And so that begs the question, like, wait a minute, now that this money is in the Roth IRA, does that count as contributions? Does that count as principal? Some of it is because you contributed from your account. Some of it's not because it's growth, but it got contributed all in this one, it got converted all in this one big chunk. I know these are complicated words. And honestly, like, I end every one of my posts with spend less than you make and invest the difference because that's what really matters. And you can get into this nuance. And I know people listen to this podcast. Some people are maybe like, oh, my God, this is complex. Maybe some people are like the super nerdy people who like want to get like get every penny of tax advantage out. So if this is over your head or this seems too complex, I like pray I ask you to not be too concerned because it's really just about exactly. Yeah. But anyway, back to the story. You convert this money into a Roth IRA. And now is that principal that you can take out whenever you want? Or is that gains you can't take out till you're 59 and a half? And the IRS has basically said, well, since it's some of both, here's the deal. It's got to stay there for five years and then it all becomes principal. And so let's say you had 100 grand in a 401k, you convert it all. Then you've got 100 grand in a Roth IRA. You'd have to pay tax, but you'd maybe pay tax out of your income or whatever. So you've got 100 grand in your Roth IRA. Five years later, you can withdraw every single penny of that tax penalty free. And then you have 100 grand in your savings account that you can use to buy things that you like. So that leads us to number four, which is the Roth conversion ladder. You generally don't want to convert large sums of money all at once because the more money you convert, that's all income tax. And income tax is a progressive tax, which means the higher income, the more tax you pay. So you don't want to do huge chunks at once. And so if you, and this one is like kind of realistic. I've heard of people who like might be in a situation where you were high income earner and maxing out your 401k for 20 years, from like 22 to 42 or something. You could have, you could have a couple of million bucks in your 401k. And what you do is like every year you convert like $50,000 from your traditional to Roth. Then five years later, you live on that $50,000 and that way you're keeping the individual. And that's why it's like a ladder because it's like this like step process where like you're number one, you convert the money you're going to spend your number six, you're number two, you convert the money that you're going to spend in your number seven and down the road. I always had this like new crop of tax penalty free money that was converted five years ago without having to like do the big massive conversion and pay the big tax bill. Exactly. And that's a perfect explanation. And I think you're right. But you know, if this is over your head, the complexity side of this here, then you know, don't worry about that. Worry about the basic stuff first if you're new to this. But at the same time, it's, it's one of those strategies that this is the most realistic one. I agree. I agree as well. I think a lot of people will kind of utilize this one. But the hardest part about this is kind of targeting those first five years because you don't really always know when you're going to retire, retire early, especially if you're doing this really quickly and saving up, you know, a lot of cash at the same time. So maybe mixing this in with a brokerage account might be one thing that you want to do as well just because it's really, really tough to time this. It's tough to time those first five years in play. So maybe once you retire, you figure out, hey, how much money do I need every single year in retirement? Then you can convert that amount every year or you can do a smaller amount and kind of do a hybrid method with a brokerage account as well. There's a bunch of different things that you can do and you can get creative with it with an HSA or something else. If you have those qualified medical expenses, there's a lot of things that you can do with it. But it's really, really cool to be able to have this option and be able to kind of convert that money over as well. So this is one that I absolutely love. So if you were in that situation and maybe you knew that you were going to retire in the next five years, would you start that process right away or would you just kind of think through this and kind of wait till you retire and maybe do some sort of hybrid method? I'd look at it. If you are someone who has like 100% of your retirement savings in a 401k and you'll be able to retire early, then yeah, looking five years out, you might start saying, okay, maybe I'm going to start ploughing money into a brokerage account. Maybe I'm going to start converting some money to cover that five year span or whatever. You know, again, we tend to talk about these things in vacuums as though there are like robots that have like very weird situations. I have $1 million in a 401k and zero other assets, but like, you know, things don't happen in a vacuum. Like, okay, yeah, I do have a couple of rental properties. I do have some money in there. I'm going to be working part time or I'm still going to be consulting or, you know, but for sure, if you're looking down the barrel, you're like, oh, I think I can do this next few years, then yeah, I would be planning for that five year window saying, okay, how am I going to cover? Do I have enough in a brokerage account? If you spend $40,000 a year and you have $300,000 in a brokerage account, then you're set, you know, and you've got $2 million in a 401k, then yeah, I would probably plan to live on your brokerage account for a few years and then start the conversion ladder process. Exactly. It's that flexibility is kind of the name of the game when it comes to some of this stuff and kind of thinking through, you know, what options do I have here and how flexible can I be with? Can I be with?","The Roth conversion ladder is a strategy for moving money from a traditional IRA or 401k into a Roth IRA in a series of smaller annual conversions to avoid a large tax bill. The money converted from a traditional to Roth IRA is subject to income tax, but after five years, it can be withdrawn without penalty. By converting smaller amounts each year, individuals can keep their income and tax bill low while steadily building up a tax-free nest egg. The Roth conversion ladder is a realistic strategy for high-income earners who have been maxing out their traditional 401k for many years and have a substantial amount saved up. However, it is still important to focus on the basic strategies of spending less than you make and investing the difference."
184,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tn3GuyzRDtg_sep_1577_1720,tn3GuyzRDtg_sep_1577_1720,"The next one is the rule of 72T. So can you explain what that is? Yes. So let's say you are in the situation that we personally have never seen, where you have so much money in retirement accounts that you can retire early, but it's all locked away, and you have no money in a mortgage account, and you have no investment in real estate providing income, and you can't take the Roth IRA principle for some reason. You can't do the Roth conversion ladder. There's yet another option that the IRS provides. This is why I get so amped up when people ask me about locking their money away, because I'm like, it's not locked away. And it's called rule 72T, which basically says, if you're in some other weird situation, you can identify a five-year window where you make separate, it's called SEPP, separate equal periodic payments. They have to be at least once per year, but they can be more per year. They have to be at least a certain minimum. And it's like, you probably want to talk to your accountant about this, but you send a form to the government being like, hey, government, just so you know, this isn't like one big withdrawal making to buy a speed bump or a speed boat, sorry. I am planning to make separate equal periodic payments over the next five years. I'm gonna take out $100,000 per year five times, and there's no penalty. That's just the rule. It's just a rule that says, you don't have to pay the penalty as long as you're kind of like doing it thoughtfully and equal periodic payments for a five-year window. And I think that the IRS probably offer that rule for people who had a 401k and were waiting for their Roth IRA letter to come through or whatever, trying to bridge those fears between until 59 and a half. Also, to be frank, I've never seen someone actually do this in real life. My audience skews younger, so maybe I just don't have that type of client or whatever. But it just doesn't get there. I know lots of early retirees, none of them have to do this because they just have the other options. Exactly, and I've never seen anybody do this one as well. It's just great to know that there's an option there, but I've never seen, and our audience is usually skewing a little younger too, but at the same time, I've never seen anybody actually do this one as well. But it goes to show that there are layers to this, there's options that you have available to you. So just like Jeremy's saying, your money is not locked up. It's not something where you will not be able to access it if you retire early. You have so many different available options here","The Rule of 72T is an option provided by the IRS for people who have a lot of money locked away in retirement accounts and want to retire early. It allows them to make separate equal periodic payments over a five-year window, without penalty, as long as they are done thoughtfully and meet certain minimum requirements. However, there are other options available such as Roth conversion ladder or real estate investments that provide income, which may be more beneficial. It's important to talk to a financial advisor or accountant to determine the best option for your situation. Overall, there are various options available and your money is not truly locked away."
185,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tn3GuyzRDtg_sep_1721_1837,tn3GuyzRDtg_sep_1721_1837,"And the last one is one I've never seen anybody use as well. I don't know if you have, but it's the Rule of 55. So why is the Rule of 55 called the Rule of 55? That's about your age. And so let's say you are a person who worked at the same employer for a very, very long time. And you were maxing out your 401k. And you end up at age 55 with a couple million bucks in there. And you can potentially retire early. But it's all locked away. The Rule of 55 says, if you leave your current employer for any reason, quit, laid off, want to retire early, you can access your most recent employer's retirement plan, 401k, 457, 403b, or TSP, tax penalty free. It just literally changes the year. And I think all these laws come from probably wealthy-ish people who write to their senators. And they're like, hey, stop locking away my 401k. And they're like, all right, whatever, 59 and 1.5, make it 55. Fuck it. And so yeah, again, uncommon. It only applies to your most recent or your last employer. But it is a nice option if you are someone who's creeping up within a decade of retirement age and you get laid off or something. Then it's like, all right, now I don't need to worry about bridging the gap. Exactly. And I could see a lot of folks, especially if they are maybe investing over a long period of time, they invest a portion of their income, maybe 10% to 20%. They could hit this level and maybe utilize it in their mid-50s and be able to access those dollars a couple of years early. Because I see a lot of people in that situation. I've never seen anybody do it. But I've seen a lot of people in this situation where they're ready to retire in their 50s. They don't want to wait till 59 and 1.5. So this is a great option for a lot of folks, especially if you've been building wealth over a long period of time. And as we know, just investing often and early is something where you can really mass a large amount of wealth in these accounts over time, especially if you've been working for the last 25, 30 years, whatever that may be as well.","In this discussion, the main topic, the Rule of 55 allows individuals who are 55 years old and have a 401k or similar retirement plan with their most recent employer to withdraw funds penalty-free if they leave their job for any reason. This option is useful for those who have accumulated a significant amount of wealth in their retirement accounts and want to retire early. However, it only applies to the most recent employer's retirement plan and is not a commonly used option."

But if you had to choose one of these, which ones would be your personal favorite? My favorite is the good old fashioned brokerage account. People always be sleeping on the brokerage account, but, and I think it's, you know, you know, we're, we live in this world of personal finance. And so I think people get nerdy about it and like, oh yeah, for, you know, Roth IRA conversion ladder and SEP IRA and backdoor Roth IRA and mega backdoor Roth IRA. Then the day a brokerage account has no limits, no restrictions, low fees. And you know, you talked about running the math on actually paying the penalty and you're like, you're like, actually it's not that big of a deal. Also, sometimes if, if you're 401k offers only bad investment options, like really high fee options, it's not crazy just to like skip it and go with a brokerage account. You know, generally I don't recommend that. I think usually taking the tax breaks, a better option, then you can always rolled over to a individual IRA, when you leave that employer, but still it's not, we're not talking about crazy numbers. And so I think people, it's kind of just like this fear of the unknown because there's so many of these crazy words floating around like, like I said, broad strokes. If you live below your means and invest early and often, and you end up with lots of money, there are so many options available. And, and just the, you know, in my own life, like most of my money's in a brokerage account and it's fine. You know, I, I get, I think I make like 50,000 bucks a year in dividends. And so I pay some income tax on those dividends, which is fine, but I get to use them. I get to buy, you know, and then if I, when I bought my house, for example, you can see behind me, if you're listening, you can't, but if, if, when I, when I bought my house, I applied for a mortgage loan. It was a $700,000 house and I decided to put 50% down and apply for a $350,000 mortgage. And at the time my net worth was about $3.8 million. And the broker said, we cannot give you any loan because you are unemployed and you are not a good loan recipient for whatever reason. I was like, oh my God. And so I was like, all right, screw this. And I just wrote a check and I took that money out of my brokerage account. I sold some of my shares of index funds and then I just wrote a check for $700,000 and now banks aren't a part of my life. And that's flexibility was really nice for me because then I don't have to worry about it. Yeah. So don't sleep on the old, the old fashioned brokerage account. It's not, it's not so bad. And I couldn't agree more. I think that flexibility, having that available is a very powerful thing. So kind of diversifying into that, especially if you putting all your money, if you're maxing out these accounts, like you can look at like investing order of operations, there's a bunch of them out there, but if you're maxing out all of these Roth IRAs, 401ks, all these different things, and you still have extra cash leftover, there's, it's, you know, it's well worth it to have that brokerage account flexibility. But if you just want to invest in the brokerage account too, there's nothing wrong with that. And I think a lot of people will make it seem like there is, but really there's not, maybe you, you know, you're want that flexibility when you go to retirement and there's a lot of extra things that you can do when that happens. So I absolutely love that as well. Said as well, said as well, said as well, said as well.","The conversation is about different types of investment accounts such as 401ks, IRAs, and brokerage accounts. The speakers agree that brokerage accounts have advantages such as flexibility and no restrictions, and can be a good option for people who have extra cash to invest or who have limited options in their 401k plans. They also emphasize the importance of living below your means and investing early and often to build wealth. Overall, the conversation offers broad strokes about personal finance and encourages people to explore their options and not be afraid of investing in a brokerage account."

No. I mean, so there's two answers to that. One is that I think, you know, I mostly talk about investing and I think in pop culture, we hear too much about everything you're supposed to do differently. But in reality, I think, you know, good investing strategy is to do a lot of things the same, you know? I literally got a text message from a friend this morning who said her dad loved her these like long voicemails at 3 a.m. telling her how the market's about to drop 30 percent, pull all your money out, the, you know, the political party that he doesn't like is trying to ruin America or whatever. And I'm just like, oh my gosh, like, no, do the same thing. Are we in a recession? I don't know. Maybe we've you're going to, you know, if you invest for 40 years, you're going to see about seven recessions because they happen every six years or so. And so, yeah, we're probably in one. And what do you do? You just keep staying the course. And so I'm going to keep buying. I'm not going to get tricky. I'm not going to pull any money out. I'm not going to switch strategies. I'm going to keep buying and holding. The thing that you can do and do and do and do and do and do and do","The speaker is discussing their approach to investing and how they believe that sticking to a consistent strategy is key to success. They use the example of a friend's father who is panicking about market drops and political events, and contrast this with their own approach of staying the course and continuing to buy and hold investments. The speaker suggests that while there may be ups and downs in the market, staying consistent and not making drastic changes to one's investment strategy is the best way to build long-term wealth."
188,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYDU-tBbH0Y_sep_167_615,HYDU-tBbH0Y_sep_167_615,"Can you talk a little bit about how your New Zealand background in terms of finances led you to do this specifically and how you bridged the gap between how things work over there and how they work over here? That's a really good question. I think when we first started out, we didn't have the intention of choosing just the US market or trying to focus on one place or another. And so we were just focusing on investing education. And we learned very quickly that the lack of investing education is very similar around the world. So even though GDP-wise or even though the amount of people that invest are much larger in the States, versus New Zealand, versus the UK, people in all countries are saying to us, hey, I still don't know how investing works. My financial literacy is still lacking. And so when we started sharing our information, it just resonated with so many people, but surprisingly a lot in the US. I can imagine. And so when it comes to investing in the market in New Zealand, are you investing generally in the same ways for retirement? Are you accessing the same markets? Yeah, so personally between myself and Sonia, my co-host and best friend of 20 years, we both find that we love to invest primarily in the US. A lot of our community will ask us, why is that the case? And it's a very simple reason for me. Some of our biggest companies in the world are US-based. And the US stock market has a lot of data and a lot of history, which I personally love because data and history for me means more reasons to understand research and go, well, that's worked for so long. Whereas countries like New Zealand, we don't have a S&P 500. We have an NZX 50 because we have 50 companies to work with. And so they're great companies, but it's very specialized and very niche down or niched down where a lot of them are related to exports. For example, Fonterra is a company in New Zealand, which is probably one of our largest companies, and that's a dairy company. So if that gives you an idea of what we're working with, I personally like to invest primarily in the US, but also a little bit in New Zealand. And I think even emerging markets are something that I like to look into as well. Were you raised to be very financially literate, personally? I would say yes and no. Yes, in terms of savings. So my family were born in India, and so was I. And we came when I was two years old. And I had a very first generation immigrant upbringing where my parents didn't have a lot. And so I got to see them work very hard and be very good with their money in terms of saving. But they took no risks when it came to their money. And I always wondered, why is that the case? Why don't they buy another home? Why don't they invest in the stock market? And to a degree, I'd say I was almost frustrated at them when I was younger. But very quickly I realized that they were focused on creating a stable environment. And for them, providing stability was the most important financial goal, and their children or the next generation from that, we had the privilege of going, okay, we've got some level of financial security, some level of stability, now let's take on the risk and let's try and learn about this stock market thing. And what does real estate look like? How do people make money from that? So I was very lucky. They taught me a lot of great skills about living within your means, not trying to go outside of that. But I would say that there were a few things I had to unlearn as well. Yeah, that's a really, really common thing that we hear on the show from people who come from a low income background, who come from a first generation immigrant background. There is, and this is definitely, my parents had a very similar aversion to risk. I understand how it can be really frustrating, but at the same time I think in the US in particular, I know that most countries, and I would assume New Zealand is like this, don't have the same use of credit and debt the way that we do in the US for consumer things. The level of debt that most American homes live with for obviously things like student loans, for their homes, for their cars, for even just appliances and furniture they might be buying. So I do think in the US there's probably an even larger benefit to living extremely conservatively and being under your means because I think for a lot of Americans just not being in a lot of debt, especially high interest credit card and consumer debt is already a huge boon. But I do think that there's something really, there's almost a process I think in a lot of these cases of adult children having to kind of then go back and teach their parents about a lot of financial management. And I'm curious, I think in the US it's especially complicated because retirement is so expensive and so little of it is generally covered by the state, so few people have pensions. How is it in New Zealand in terms of having to individually prepare for retirement? It's unfortunately very similar and you'd think in a country that is known to have a level of cares associated with its most vulnerable populations we have what we call is a super which is like a pension for the everyday person and that doesn't even cover rent for anyone. Also New Zealand is one of the few countries left in the sort of quote unquote developed world where retirement funds are quite new for us. So we don't have the equivalent of a 4-1-OK until about 15 years ago. So anyone before that, unless they've saved the money for themselves, which as you know, the average person doesn't usually, a lot of people were left without any retirement savings and only I guess my generation and the generation after have now been having access to these things. So on one hand we're seeing improvements in how people are setting themselves up for retirement but it's funny human behavior is still so similar across the states in New Zealand where people still need a helping hand with retirement and we're still seeing so much work that needs to be done in that space. You know, you're obviously, you and your best friend and co-founder are obviously quite entrepreneurial as women and entrepreneurial in a way that's taken you pretty far away from home obviously. Is that unusual in not just New Zealand particularly amongst women? I would say when it comes to the entrepreneurial spirit it is slightly unusual with the background that we come from especially culturally. So I am South Asian Indian by heritage and I still remember when Girls That Invest was kicking off we had family friends reach out to my parents, my parents, my parents, my parents, my parents.","The conversation was about the guest's background and how it led her to create a podcast focused on investing education. They discussed the similarities in lack of investing education around the world and how people from different countries resonated with their information. The guest also talked about why she primarily invests in the US market, citing the abundance of data and history as reasons to understand research. The conversation then shifted to the guest's upbringing and how her parents instilled the value of saving but were risk-averse when it came to investing. The host and guest then talked about the commonality of immigrant parents being risk-averse and having to unlearn certain financial habits. Finally, the conversation touched on retirement and how, unfortunately, New Zealand and the US share similarities in individuals having to prepare for retirement as opposed to relying on government pension."

If you're giving a lot of maternity leave, if you're paying competitive wages, if you're having people be employees instead of contractors, those things are really hard. New York does somewhat make it easier. For example, on the maternity leave front, there is no federally mandated maternity leave, but there are state by state laws that kind of help out with that. So in New York, for example, we are reimbursed about three months of our employees' maternity leave up to a certain dollar amount. It doesn't cover the whole thing, but it covers a lot of it. So there are advantages and disadvantages, whereas on the other hand, we do pay a lot more taxes being a business in New York than we would in another state. So I think it's easy to start a business, but harder to run a business ethically and still be competitive, I would say, is how it is in the US. That is, I mean, it's devastating, but it does make sense. And it's so interesting how those sort of things will almost hold people back from starting or hold them back from being good employers or creating a company where they feel proud of the company culture. I think it's, you'd want those things to be incentivized. And I think if New Zealand can do one thing right is that, you know, maternity leave is covered by the government. We have a lot of laws that if your employer doesn't do something, it's very easy to sort of whistleblow or go straight.","The speaker discusses the challenges of running a small business in the US, particularly in terms of being competitive while maintaining ethical practices. They mention the difficulty of offering benefits such as maternity leave, paying competitive wages, and classifying employees correctly. While there are state-specific laws that can help, such as New York's reimbursement for maternity leave, the speaker acknowledges that there are still disadvantages, such as higher taxes. They contrast this with New Zealand's government-supported maternity leave policy and employee protections. Overall, the speaker suggests that the US could benefit from incentivizing ethical business practices and employee benefits."

Dual income, no kids. And I don't plan to have kids. I live kind of below my means. And so I definitely can afford to pay myself less than some of our employees, or definitely less than the average, which is a privilege for sure. There are definitely people who have a lot higher costs of living, who have a family to support, who don't have a dual income, and all of that stuff. So I will set kind of that privilege aside. However, beyond that, there is such a normalization in the US of executives, founders, CEOs, all of that being paid so much more than how much their employees are paid. And there are now many countries that are increasingly creating laws around how much higher executives can be paid than employees. But I will say there is definitely still a huge norm that you're fighting against. For example, one time when we were considering working with an investor, which we ended up walking away from, they had to adjust the valuation to sort of compensate for the fact that I was being so underpaid by standard. And they were like, your costs are falsely low, essentially, because you're paying yourself so little comparatively, and you should be paying yourself x amount, which the company really couldn't function if I was also. And B, we have a four-day work week, which is to me a lot more valuable than whatever. But point being, it's so ingrained in how we think about business in the US that they had to literally adjust for it in our valuation. Because they're like, if we were to invest, we would require that you be paying yourself this amount of money. Even though I don't have any desire to have that additional income. And again, it's hard to talk about these things from my perspective, because I don't want to sound like I'm like, oh, I'm such a great person. I'm really martyring myself. I live a fantastic life. I don't need more money. But the point is that the idea of being a business owner and executive in the US is it so heavily tilts you towards exploitation and towards really treating yourself in such a different way than you treat people that you work with or who work for you. I do think you're fighting a really, really uphill battle in the US, too. You can own a business, but can you own a good business? It's interesting that you say that, because I am the exact same. And so with Girls That Invest, one of the things that we do is we're very transparent about how much the business makes and how much we make for ourselves. And so I share that I give myself around New Zealand $52,000 a year, which is what in the US, maybe under $40,000. And that's definitely the lowest salary in the whole company. And that's because I don't, in the exact same grain, I don't need more. And I'm quite happy with I'd rather have that money in my business, and I'd rather help it grow that way. And it's so interesting to hear that if I was ever to take investors, that would be seen as a negative. Oh, yeah. Yeah, not just a negative. I mean, it literally transforms the valuation of, I was really shocked that they were like, they basically were like, we're discounting all of your profit margins, because that should be going into executive pockets, essentially. It's almost like they're saying, hey, systemically, this is how we like to do it. And if you do it differently, you're wrong. Totally. And that's, I mean, that's definitely why we went through the process twice with two different potential investors. We, through the whole due diligence and all that stuff, wasted so much money and time on that, never again. But we really came out of it very clearly like, oh, we'll never do this. Because I think that there are, I mean, unless you're going to be a nonprofit who is running on grant money and donations and things like that, and even still, there's so many problems with the nonprofit system in the US. But there is basically no way to accept structural investment in the US and still make a lot of choices that do not prioritize profit and growth. Because ultimately, if you have investors, and I mean, to take it back to the investing concept, one of the biggest structural problems in the US that, unfortunately, on an individual level, participating in the investment market obligates you to reinforce is that we're in a model where what publicly traded companies have to prioritize legally is their shareholders, which usually will come at the expense of employee wages and environmental practices and things like that. But on the smaller level, as a small business owner, if you're going to take on investors, those investors are going to want to see a return on their investment at the expense of ethics, basically. You almost hope that in the future, those investors start to become people that look like us and sound like us. Because once we have people up there, they're going to see the value that we see. Because I believe that you can still prioritize people and the environment and still make money in the long term. Sustainable investing, ethical investing, I'm sure we'll get into it later. But it's just one of those things that once you fix it up there, I can imagine that it improves. Until then, it's just so disheartening that even a company like yours would be having to go through something like this.","The interviewee discusses the normalization in the US of executives being paid significantly more than their employees and how this creates a system of exploitation. As a business owner, she pays herself less than her employees and is transparent about her salary. However, when considering investors, she found that they would require her to pay herself more, which is against her values. The US system prioritizes shareholder profits over ethical considerations, which she believes can be changed if more people like her are in positions of power. Sustainable and ethical investing is also discussed as a potential solution."

But I don't feel good about a lot of the companies on the S&P 500. I feel really complicated and conflicted about tying my financial future to that. What do I do? It's a question that I used to have for myself. And so I really sympathize with people that are in that dilemma. Because at the end of the day, like you've said, we know we need to invest. But also, we all have certain ethical beliefs. And they might be different for different people, but you don't want to wake up every day and do something that doesn't align with your value. I like to use the terminology in our book and in our podcast. You want to invest in a way that helps you sleep easy at nighttime. And so one thing that I want to just make very clear is one of the biggest misconceptions, which you probably know as well with investing, is you don't have to choose profits or people. You don't have to say, hey, I want to invest ethically, but I also want to make money. Maybe back in the day, maybe five or 10 years ago, you had to choose and go, yeah, okay, well, ethical investing, that's so woo woo woo. We've got one fund out the back if you want to take that one. There was a Morningstar study that looked at about 400 ethical funds and about 7,000 everyday funds. And they found that across countries, and not just in the UK, not just in the US, but across types of investments, the ethical funds either did just as well or even better than the average funds. And so that to me was great news. And I think for anyone listening, they can go, okay. They can go, okay, so I can find funds that are ethical and they give me good returns, at least up to something like an S&P 500 fund. And it's just a matter of trying to decide, well, now what kind of fund are you after? I'm of the belief that if you invest in the S&P 500, there are companies in there that you might not agree with and you've just got to look at the holdings and make that choice. So what I mean by that is if you jump online and see what holdings, what's made up of that fund, you can see, hey, look, there's company A and it's got 0.4% of the entire fund in it. Should I invest in it? Is 0.4% enough to upset me? If it is, that's totally fine. You just look for a different fund that doesn't have it. And I'd like to take a quick pause here to thank today's sponsor, advisor.com. The TFD community loves advisor.com, so I am incredibly thrilled to be partnering with them this year. As you know, one of my life's passions is making financial education accessible for everyone. It shouldn't matter where you come from, what level of education you have, or what your current financial circumstances are. I'd argue that the more precarious your current financial situation is, the more important it is to educate yourselves financially. And that includes having a professional guide you along the way to help you make the best decisions and to navigate our financial systems with confidence. Getting to work with a living, breathing financial advisor has historically been out of reach for those with less than 250K in the bank, despite the fact that many of life's meaningful financial moments happen way before hitting that financial milestone. Robo advisors and apps have tried to fill that gap. And while they can be helpful depending on your situation, there really is no replacement for one-on-one guidance and connections. Advisor.com provides their clients with a top-notch advising team for a fixed flat annual fee. If you have money resolutions for 2023 and are feeling motivated to make positive changes, think of them as your financial accountability partner. Their team of advisors work for you, not commissions, and will help you to achieve your smart financial goals through planning, investing, tax strategizing, and more. As I mentioned earlier, the TFD community loves and trusts advisor.com. So schedule a free consultation with advisor.com today at advisor.com and never make another financial decision alone. I think that's a good system to use. I think my general response when we hear those kind of questions is that, well, first of all, we have to be clear that keeping yourself in poverty or financial precarity helps no one. At the end of the day, I think we have to put our own oxygen masks on first. And a lot of people, I think, look at investing as superfluous. But when you look at how the opportunities and avenues that middle-class Americans have to build enough long-term wealth to be able to retire, which to me is a necessity for people, there's really very little to no way to do it outside of investing in the market. Like it or not, that's kind of the system that we have. Should we also, at the same time, be advocating for things like stronger social security, pensions, unions, all of these things? Absolutely. And I think we can walk and chew gum. But I do think that, for the time being, we're going to have to help ourselves not be in financial precarity. Because another thing that we often hear from our audience, especially people who grew up low income, grew up first gen, et cetera, is having to take care of their own family members in retirement, having to support them. So I do think it's important for us to remember that if we are putting ourselves in a position of not having enough money to live at a certain point, that we are just shifting that burden onto someone else, which is certainly helping no one and possibly putting a really big burden on loved ones. So I kind of want to put that to the side. But I will say when it comes to the negative,","The speaker discusses the dilemma faced by investors who want to invest ethically but do not want to compromise on profits. The speaker suggests that ethical investing and financial returns are not mutually exclusive and that investors can find funds that align with their values and provide good returns. The speaker also suggests that investors can research the holdings of the funds they are considering investing in to ensure that they are not investing in companies that do not align with their values. The speaker emphasizes the importance of investing in the market to build wealth and retire comfortably and notes that while there are other avenues to build wealth, investing in the market is often the most accessible and effective option."

Now I'm going to sound uninformed. Did he do mail bombs? Was that the thing? He did a bunch of different things. He did all kinds of stuff. He was getting into stuff left, right, and center. But anyway, so basically, he's like an eco-terrorist, essentially, who was living in the woods and in a complete off-grid cabin situation, writing all these big manifestos. Are you conferring? He's alive. OK. Hi, Ted. I know you're watching. But writing all these manifestos about needing to go back to a different era and becoming harmonious with nature and civilization being a cancer on the planet and all of these things. And a lot of people smarter than me have done real analyses of his writings and things like that. And the thing is that if you are someone who has things like climate anxiety and real meaningful criticisms of the late-stage capitalism in which we're living that has eroded basically all labor protections and things like that in the US, there's a lot of truth to it, right? Like there's a lot of these are real existential concerns that I think people have to mitigate. But I do think that unless we're able to come up with some kind of internal litmus test that is imperfect but sufficient, there's really just a kind of, you're on a loop to nihilism, basically. It's something that I've toyed with myself, the concern of, well, I don't want to really say I love capitalism. I can't say I do. But at the same time, I'm waking up every day and I'm going to a job and I'm exchanging my time for money. And then if I want to buy some food, I need to exchange money for the services and the goods I'm after. And so I used to kind of go through this dilemma of, is the stock market ethical? Is it ethical to invest? Is it ethical to buy a home, buy real estate? And I think my conclusion came down to the fact that if I and the everyday person is putting time and effort into having a job, paying taxes, exchanging their goods and services for money and vice versa, then you're already part of the system. And there is a group of people who are benefiting from that. And those are people that invest in the stock market. And if you can be someone that is putting energy into this and then also taking, you can then take those returns and put them into good use. You can take those returns and help your family. You can take those returns and then go donate it into the nonprofits that you really care about or the charities that you care for. So I believe that, in a way, given the circumstances that we have in the situation that you have, it is ethical to invest in the stock market if you can do good with the money that you get from it. I agree. And also, the more power you have in any given system and in capitalism, money and resource is power. The more you have an ability to change that system, the more you have an ability to influence it. And I do think something a recent guest brought up that I thought was a really good point is, when you have money, when you're earning money, no one's forcing you to keep it. Just because you have the ability to accumulate more wealth doesn't mean you need to continue to accumulate it beyond what you need to live. You can give that money away. You can pay other people. You can do all kinds of things with money that are not just continuing to hoard wealth. And I do think people often conflate the ideas of building enough wealth to, again, do things like be able to stop working when you're older and becoming a sort of cartoonish capitalist who just hoards wealth. Absolutely. I think one of the things that not a lot of people from our girls that invest community know about myself is I used to run or created a social media, another community called the Indian Feminist. And that was quite big on Instagram. This was back in 2016. And we had 300,000. Oh, were you 12? No, I was older than 12. And we had 300,000 followers. We had Pranka Chopra following us. It was a big movement. And that was around the idea of trying to get equality, especially for South Asian women. And as much as that account spoke about the issues that we were facing and the concerns that we had, there was nothing that was really going to fix it besides money. And I realized very quickly that the patriarchy, at least within the South Asian context, but in most, I think, contexts as well, that unless the financial imbalances equalize, that's when women can stand up for themselves. That's when we can say, hey, look, that's not OK with me. And now I have the money to go if you don't sort it out. Well said. I'm doing mental math. 18? Yes. This is so stressful. When I was 18, trust me, I was not doing that. But suffice to say, I do think that there's a real, as I was mentioning earlier, there are so many problems in the nonprofit world and in NGOs. And I think one of the most fundamental issues that you're speaking to here is the idea that, and it's a very chauvinist, classist, racist, all of these things, ideas that you need to tell people what to do. And you can't just give people money, which I think in the vast majority of cases, rather than paying a bunch of overpaid executives and redirecting these monies. Because essentially, a lot of NGOs exist as essentially money and reputation laundering operations for corporations and do all kinds of sweetheart deals with for-profit institutions. And there are so many problems. But a lot of it boils down to the idea that rather than all of this rigmarole, why don't we go into these areas and just hand women a check? I think a lot of times the bigger question. And I think part of it is, again, that sort of really chauvinistic idea that you know better than they do. But also, I think there's a real strange relationship that I think often more progressive-minded people have with money, which is that they very much accept the idea that money can be empowering to a certain type of person. But when it comes to the extremely poor, when it comes to people who are being very seriously oppressed, for some reason, we don't accept that money empowers in the same way. It's almost like, is it too simple to just be the answer? Maybe it's not the answer. But it's clearly the answer for rich people, right? They're doing all kinds of great stuff with their money. And when you think about terms of scale, we've all seen documentaries where you're looking at people for whom $1,000 is a life-changing sum for them and their children. And I do think that there's a really paternalistic attitude that while you can, and it's also why I think it's becoming less popular, but I do think that there is?????pleasant there is I think that, think that there, think that, think that, think that, think that, think that there is","The conversation touches on the Unabomber, an eco-terrorist who believed civilization was a cancer on the planet. The speakers discuss the dilemma of participating in capitalism while also having concerns about its negative impact. They conclude that investing in the stock market can be ethical if the money earned is put to good use, such as supporting charities or helping others. The power and influence that comes with money is also discussed, with the idea that accumulating wealth beyond what is necessary for a comfortable life can be harmful. The speakers also touch on the importance of financial equality in achieving social justice, particularly in the context of empowering women."

What is your kind of fundamental advice in that regard? We call ourselves NANA investors because we're so boring when it comes to our money and our investing style. I love to read the news. So I will read the stock market news, and I will check up on things. But Sonia, my co-host, she checks her portfolio once a quarter. And she does not care about what's happening in the stock market world. She is accumulating her wealth so that she can live her life and not the other way around. And I find it so helpful when I was younger to understand that concept of investing in the stock market is not what you see in movies. It is not all for Wall Street. It's not those TV shows where you've got like five different screens and you've got this whole setup at home. It's a few automated things that you can do when you have $1. You can do if you have $1,000 to invest. And it's very, very simple. And what I like to do, I'm very open and transparent, is I have two or three ETFs that I invest in regularly. And every month, I put in the same amount automatically from my bank account into those funds in my brokerage account. And I don't do anything else. Every now and again, I might invest in an individual company that makes up maybe 5% or 10% of my portfolio. But it's just about doing the least amount of work for the best outcome. And that's my belief when it comes to the stock market. It does not have to be your whole life. It sure doesn't. And it shouldn't. As far as the sort of really nitty gritty, I think a lot of people still have a difficult time visualizing what it actually means to go and invest. You're like, well, what do I buy? Where do I go? Could you just really quickly walk through the very, very practical process of opening your account and what you have to do? Again, I used to think you had to call someone up. I used to think. And the millennial in me, it was like, I can't invest in the stock market if I have to talk to someone on the phone. Ain't that the truth? And so in the most simplest way, if I was to say, hey, I want to start investing, I would set up an online brokerage account. And that can be with anyone. I think a lot of people get analysis paralysis trying to choose the best broker to go with. A broker is basically an online website where you can buy shares. And we've all heard of Robinhood. That might not be the best place for you. There's Wealthsimple. We've got so many. We've got Interactive Broker. Vanguard, Fidelity. So many out there. And not just in the US. You could be based in anywhere in the world. And there will be a brokerage company in your country. And so you set up an online account. They just usually require a little bit of identification. So make sure you've got that on you. You input money into those accounts. Doesn't mean that you've invested. It just means there's money sitting there. And then you can just, on a website, see these different companies and just click on one and take it to the checkout. It is like online shopping for a shirt. It is so simple. It is. I call it anti-climatic when I learned how to invest because I was like, that's it. That's all it takes. I could do this in my bedroom, in my pajamas. And yet I always thought I needed to wear a suit and talk on the phone and have someone yell at me. Like it's $4 now. It's $2.50. Hurry up, choose and invest. Nothing like that. The internet's done a lot of bad things in human history, but it has been investing really easy and you don't have to get on the phone with anyone, which is a win. Absolutely. And then your next question might be, well, okay, now that that's how you invest, which is not very difficult, how do you choose what to invest in? And I think that can confuse a lot of people, but one of my favorite methods that again I use is the Boglehead method or the Boglehead method. And that was founded by John Bogle, who's the founder of Vanguard. Big fan of him. And it was the idea of, well, hey, look, you've got three different funds that you can invest in. You've got your everyday stock market portfolio fund, like an S&P 500 fund that invests in all the companies in the US or at least the top 500. Then you might wanna invest in some international companies, maybe something in New Zealand or Australia. So you've got an international portion, an international fund, and then you might wanna invest in a couple of bonds and you might get a bond ETF or fund. And then that percentage changes based on your risk tolerance. So I might say, I don't want risk, I don't want my stock market portfolio to go up and down, so I might have a very heavy bond portfolio compared to stocks. Or I might say, I'm 25, I'm investing until I'm 60 for retirement, I wanna retire a little bit early, I might have more shares than bonds. And that might sound confusing and you might wanna listen to this part one more time, but the idea is, I can summarize it in two minutes, it's not as difficult as people have made it out to be. Not at all. I would make one recommendation though, especially if you're looking to invest across international waters, and that is to just do a little bit of a look-see into the tax implications. A lot of people, when it comes to investing, I think don't really think about taxes, they don't think about, for example, in the case of tax advantaged retirement accounts, like a 401k and IRA, all that stuff, it's important to know that the benefits of those are completely canceled out if you are touching that early and there are also penalties and things like that to know about. Also, if you're in one country investing in another country, there may be tax implications in both countries, you have to just make sure that you understand what you're doing. Also, sometimes you can be taxed on the gains of a certain stock or holding before you necessarily have that cash liquid, which is an issue people run into quite a lot. So understanding tax implications is very important, but I think one other thing to remember is that generally when it comes to investing, there is a sliding scale of how much you're paying out of your earnings and how much you actually have to do or think about yourself. So at the highest end of that, you're going to have funds that someone is actually physically working on and helping make decisions and give you the information directly and all that stuff. Then you have things like robo advisors where all of those little calculations are made, it's really just totally set it and forget it. You are generally, in those cases, paying higher fees. And then there are also brokerages where you manage everything yourself. And some people really like doing that, and they also love that you pay the lowest fees generally when you do that. But then you're going to have to have the highest level of vigilance and awareness of the decisions that you're making. Something that I think is often really helpful if you're just getting started is to use a robo advisor as a gateway drug into investing and being a little bit less intimidated by it. And then as the years go on and you get more comfortable with it and you understand the process more, then you can work on optimizing for minimal fees. Absolutely, I love that. Because I'm so cheap, I'm on the minimal fees end. But I love the idea of start with a robo advisor. At least you're getting started.","The discussion is about investing in the stock market and how it's not as complicated as people may think. The speaker recommends opening an online brokerage account, choosing a few ETFs, and investing in them regularly, automating the process as much as possible. They suggest using the Boglehead method, which involves investing in a few different funds, including a stock market portfolio, an international fund, and a bond fund. The percentage of each fund depends on the individual's risk tolerance. The speaker emphasizes that investing in the stock market does not have to be your whole life and that it can be done with a few automated actions, even if you don't have a lot of money to invest."

And we wanted to show you that if you do understand personal finance, you can get organized enough to get out of really precarious situations. Something that was very unique to millennials is the average amount of student loan debt on their heads. And we wanted to show that you can still achieve your great things in life despite these financial realities and obstacles that are kind of unique to our generation. So she's an attorney. Yes. And you're an MBA. Yes. Got it. So how much do you ever disclose how much student loan debt? Yeah, yeah. We're very forward about it. It's right in the book. Right now, outstanding balance is just shy of $300,000. Ooh, buddy. Yeah. Good gracious. It's a lot of money, right? That is a lot of money. But if you work hard enough and are deliberate about how you want to build your career and go after your goals and prioritize them right, you can deal with stuff like that. There's humble brag, not really. But you've got to have a lot of income to deal with that expense and still put two kids through daycare and buy a house and afford living in that house. So for all the flack that the generation gets around millennials don't own homes and they can't do extra, start families, settle down, and get married, I'm here to tell you that. That's just not true. And there's some real practical things you can do to get on your way. I think that's not totally untrue. I think there is some reality to it for a lot of people who maybe have similar levels of debt, but perhaps not the earning potential to go with it. But we can get to that in a bit. I'm curious in your particular situation. So that's quite a significant amount of debt. Is there any element of your education or how you took on the debt, how you went through school, that you regret? For me and my decision to go get an MBA here in New York, I have zero regrets about that decision. I think it was always a goal of mine when I moved to New York. And I think it was necessary to acquire a few things that I would need to continue building my business. It was a very calculated decision down to how many clients I would need to acquire within graduating to make that student loan payment a wash and then how to make money on top of that. And granted, I went to business school after Heather went to law school. She, as we write in the book, is the cautionary tale of what happens when you make perhaps uninformed financial decisions that load you up with student loan debt and what you need to do to overcome that. And she faced tremendously a lot more obstacles than I did because she graduated right into the middle of the recession in 2010 and what the job environment looked like for her. And I do understand your point that you wanted to make earlier that, look, people make decisions to put huge debt stacks on their balance sheet, and their income is just not going to alleviate. Or the profession that they chose doesn't offer that type of revenue to justify the expense that they're going to have from their loans. And for those particular cases, it gets more extreme with ways to solve for that. But I do feel that. I do work with clients in that position all the time. And I'm going to continue to toe the line that there is a way to plan around those types of situations. You might not like the answers, but. Yeah, I mean, but that being said, there are also a lot of situations that people can find themselves in that are kind of totally out of the realm of preparation, one thing, for example, being huge medical burdens. So I don't think, for the record, I mean, if I were a fatalist about this sort of thing, I wouldn't be in this business. I obviously believe that for a huge number of people, including millennials, there is a good amount of individual choice that will go into the life you can have. And I even think that, and I think that even for someone who is scraping by, even if you're taking in $10 a month, I think you should have a nice itemized budget for where that $10 is going. No question. So I definitely agree with that. But I do think one of the things that our audience will often have kind of like a bit of an eye-rolly response to, because our audience is, I would say, very different from the vast majority of personal finance people, that they'll kind of eye-roll about is hearing people who are success stories talk to you about how they can also be a success story. And obviously, the path that you have with your wife, she's an attorney, your financial advisor, that is a pretty lucrative set of married people. So I guess what is maybe your most salient tip for people who have maybe not such great earning potential, but a ton of debt? Yeah, I think it goes to fundamentals and mastering things like cash flow. It squarely comes down to putting in the work on these foundational areas to set yourself up for success. It's step one. If you don't know, as you just perfectly said, if you make $10 and you spend $10 and you don't know where that $10 went, you're not in control. And if you're not in control, you're gonna have a very difficult time achieving any goal you set out to achieve, whether that's affording an apartment, building a cash reserve, buying a home, whatever it may be. And this applies to everyone. And cynically, I think we as a society are terrible at personal finance. Typically, we do very bad in this category. But the one area that deserves the most attention and the most work is cash flow. And people don't go through 12 months of their expenses, generally and broadly at the very least categorize them and start learning about their spending behavior. Now, I don't wanna tell people how to spend their money. I want them to know how they're spending the money so they can make informed decisions about where they wanna cut or not do anything. But at least then the decision is an informed one. And if you're not doing that, you're shooting from the hip, you're reactionary in every single decision you're making around your money. And that's gonna set you back. So it's those fundamentals that everyone, everyone can get behind regardless of how much money you're making, how much debt you took on. It's just get to know yourself, know yourself from a monetary perspective. What typically brings people into your office for the first time? So for me, it's when responsibilities have gone up so much that free time has gone down to the extent to where they no longer can afford the time to focus on their own finances. They wanna outsource that part of their life or just get organized around it. So basically enough responsibilities come whether it's someone's pregnant, promotion, death in the family, big life event or success, or even failure that says, hey, I need to get organized around my financial life. So life, so life.","The discussion centers around personal finance and the speakers' experience with student loan debt. The speakers discuss how personal finance can help individuals get out of precarious situations, such as significant amounts of student loan debt. Despite the financial realities and obstacles unique to millennials, the authors explain that individuals can still achieve their goals if they are deliberate and prioritize effectively. They disclose that their outstanding balance is just shy of $300,000 and explain how they were deliberate about their education choices to acquire the necessary skills to build their careers. They caution that individuals should be aware of their earning potential and choose professions that offer revenue to justify the expense of their loans. The discussion also highlights the importance of budgeting and cash flow to set oneself up for success, regardless of earning potential."
195,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NG6gyfiXC8_sep_641_1000,4NG6gyfiXC8_sep_641_1000,"Do you often see people coming in with very similar mistakes, similar bad approaches? Yeah, there's a commonality across the board with everyone circling just right back to really cash flow. Forget budgeting for a second, because budgeting should be based around the actual data. A lot of times I see people come in with a budget, and I know it's totally bullshit, because it's not based on actual data. It was like, I think I'm spending, other than rent, which you know, or the mortgage, or the big reoccurring monthly items. The rest of it is what you think you're spending, and that's just not going to help you be disciplined and systematic with savings, right? Because it all comes back to then that. Well, what can you afford to save? Great, can you do that consistently? And what are people often doing right when they come in? They, that's a great, great question. Nothing. Yeah, no. The first thing they're doing right is acknowledging that they need help in this area of their life, and they're going to seek out that help. There are a lot of people who come in, and you have to understand, I work, yes, in your older, high achieving millennial space. So naturally, there's a lot of things that they've done right in their lives and careers to get to the point where they feel they need that level of organization. So I generally see, despite shooting from the hip a lot from the budget side, I do see good behaviors in terms of not yoloing the crap out of their paycheck every month. I do see clarity in the goals that they want, right? I think that's probably the big one. They know what they want for themselves, and that's a very difficult question for a lot of people to answer. I see you often. So you guys should check out his Twitter. We'll link it in the description and the show notes. It's very humorous, but it seems to have kind of this almost exasperation with financial media. You often, I think, are kind of a little bit roasting the way that the financial media talks about things. Yeah, that's a fine line I walk, because I do so much financial media. I just came from Bloomberg here today. I mean, you don't want to bite the hand that feeds you. Primarily having good relationships with the actual people writing and producing that article is a good hedge against telling the truth. You're telling the truth. And it's what we call financial pornography. You've heard about this. Not the fun kind. No, not the fun kind. This is the one where like, oh, I did this in these five steps, and you can too. It's like, no. No, you cannot do these five steps. You literally cannot do that. That is very kind of rare or individualized to the person telling that story. But it makes a great headline. It will get clicks. And if you're not overly critical and try and remain objective, you can read these articles and find the nugget. God knows how many articles you will see my name in that have headlines like that. And I'm sure there are more than several dozen you could pull out. But if you don't get too caught up in it, you can actually pull out nuggets of information. Generally, personal finance articles are helpful in that they're trying to help people take control of their financial life. And there's still news organizations trying to make money. So yes, it takes something sensational to click and start to see what's in that article. I mean, that's the world we live in. We've BuzzFeeded it, as far as the way we go about it right now. I feel like our audience is pretty attuned now to being like, this millennial saved $200,000. And it's like paragraph three, grandfather died. Oh, I hate it. I hate this. I feel like those were good at ignoring. But I do feel also, so I feel like I see on your Twitter a little bit of criticism and pushback against a lot of the market reporting or the way that we talk about the market. And I feel like a lot of our audience probably still feels like, I don't know what to listen to. And I don't know what's really worth me following and what news is relevant to me. So how would you recommend someone can be a thoughtful and conscientious consumer of market news? Yeah, yeah. And let's talk about that. It's market. There's a difference between news articles on the markets. How did the S&P 500 do today? Why did it sell off? And I think as a financial planner, we're talking about investment planning. And it's just one piece of the overall financial life of an individual versus articles about personal finance in general, the budgeting, the fundamental stuff. So what's interesting is that forever, investments will be the sizzle of personal finance. It is the absolute sexiest part. I think that should give some indication as to how unsexy this industry is. That's the sexy part. Exactly my point. Yeah, if you could scream, buy, buy, buy, sell, sell, sell. Look how Tesla did. Look how Microsoft did. Oh my god, it's gone parabolic. The short sellers got roasted on this. I mean, I could go on and on and on. You can't do that for cash flow. You can't do that for life insurance. You can't do that for estate planning. OK, now you have to do a will. You have to go see the attorney and draft these. That's a fun day. We got to pay a lawyer money. I mean, you and I do. But most people to go. I'm morbid. Same. Most people who are going to sit down with the attorney, they don't want to do that. They got to then pay them money. Definitely don't want to. Definitely don't want to. Definitely don't want to. Definitely don't want to. Definitely don't want to.","In a discussion about personal finance, a financial planner notes that the most common mistake people make is not focusing on cash flow and creating budgets based on actual data. Despite this, he sees good behavior from clients who seek help, especially in setting clear financial goals. He also critiques the sensationalism and ""financial pornography"" of media reporting on personal finance and the market, encouraging consumers to be discerning in their consumption of news. Finally, he emphasizes the importance of investments in personal finance and the need to balance them with other financial planning considerations such as cash flow, life insurance, and estate planning."

We're holding out compound interest and like, if you have time on your side, your money will grow better, get it in there earlier. And I'm just like, hold up. Like let's actually build strong financial foundations before we go putting risk on any dollar. To circle it back to the initial question, is there a way I get, or maybe there's no answer to this question. Is there a way to be a thoughtful consumer of market news or no? Yes. We really deviated from that initial question. Twice, in fact. But I'm glad because both other answers were interesting. Third time's the charm. Third time's the charm. Look, if you're going to consume news of any kind, whether it be financial, political, or otherwise, I would encourage you to take your news in from multiple sources, whether that's mainstream media, people in the Twitter sphere. This video right here. Look, a lot of the mechanics are very straightforward stuff. A lot of this has to do with knowing thyself and how you take that information and apply it to your life. So just be broad. Not any one place is going to solve this. Certainly not personal finance, subreddit. Those fuckers are crazy. They are not a good bunch. It's extreme. But go take a, listen, go take a peek in there. Like go take a peek. Maybe a small 3% allocation. Put your gloves on. You know, of your time. Yeah, it's pretty wild in there. But if you look at all of these sources, there are a lot of truth tellers out there. I think there's a lot of amazing financial blogs. My friends at Rit Holtz Wealth Management put out a ton of that content. And there's a lot of truth tellers over there in terms of giving you a real objective way to look at the markets in personal finance. Yeah. So you mentioned that one. Are there any others that you think are really great sources that people should include in their media diet? I'm going to plug myself here. You got a weekly blog over at Bonafide Wealth. But a good place to find or an aggregator of the financial blogosphere, AbnormalReturns.com. My friend Tadas does an amazing job every day aggregating great financial news. So maybe that's a really good way to find some objective stuff. Out of pure curiosity, what do you think of Dave Ramsey? What a good noise. Yeah. Put me on the corner on that one. I have to respect all the OGs in personal finance. Because at the end of the day, if the mission is to make a more informed society, I got to give a thumbs up to that. Now, I can be very critical of the approach in doing that. What specifically in the approach do you think? Because we have a lot of audience. I would say, actually, we don't have a ton of overlap. But we have some overlap. We recently interviewed Graham Stephan, who's a huge Ramsey acolyte and loves him. And Graham and I shared a lot of audience. So I can only imagine that by association, there are a lot of people who follow him. My philosophy on so many things is probably the polar opposite. But I'm curious as to what parts of the specific financial strategies you might take issue with. Yeah, sure. I do take issue with some of that gospel, which primarily comes around debt repayment strategy. So he's a big snowball fan versus avalanche. I just don't like the notion that people are too stupid to make the decision that puts more money in their pocket. I know the Harvard study. I know it psychologically works. I still just believe people can be trained up to do what's financially in their best interest. I'm a financial advisor. I've studied this stuff enough to show people how to put more money in their pocket. And you're literally pushing something that doesn't. I have an issue with that. I even wrote about a hybrid strategy. Look up how much money. And someone wrote about they called it the blizzard. I then I then I then took it one step further. I'm like, I found a calculator that would show you how much money you would save using snowball versus avalanche. You'd say for with with avalanche. And I said, take half of the money you would save and go buy yourself something to remind you of the great job you're doing and take the other half amount and plowed into the loans. That way you could get the psychological benefit of doing a good job and actually save money in your pocket. So that's one big area that he puts out there that I disagree with. And that's OK. There's obviously two camps here and now a hybrid camp. And the biggest one is when you see a 12 percent rate of return assumption being used, that should not be allowed. The 12 percent assumption market, I find that to be pretty borderline unethical, personally. Because I think the average person who has no real context for what they could expect on like a 10 year, 20, whatever, that sounds normal. That sounds reasonable. And it's not. It is irresponsible. When we're doing retirement plan projections for our clients on a historical 80 percent stock, 20 percent bond mix, we're assuming 6 and 1.25 percent. And that's before a 2 percent inflation. Just to make sure everyone's with us, will you just explain what we're talking about? Sure. So when we're trying to solve for what it would take for someone to be able to retire, one of the assumptions we need to use is what kind of rate of return would people get on their investments. And the 12 percent is what we're against people using because it's abnormally high or irresponsibly high. When we look at what diversified portfolios really return and use in our analysis, we're using something that's almost half of that. And that's before we take into account something called inflation, purchasing power at 2 percent. So this is where I get a little terminology here, real returns versus nominal returns. So the real return is when you factor in inflation, which brings us down to 4 and 1.25. There is a huge difference between 4 and 1.25 real and even if they're 12 as nominal, it means 10. That's huge. Literally more than twice. When you start solving scenarios or goals with a return that high, what happens is you're showing things that are super achievable. You're giving a false sense of what it would take to get there. And I'm not trying to make like, if anything, I believe a planner should make it look, you know, a little harder, be more conservative, at least like from the professional sample, professional sample, professional sample, professional sample, professional sample, professional sample, professional sample.","The discussion covers personal finance, starting with building a strong financial foundation before investing. It is suggested to take in news from multiple sources, not relying on one alone. Dave Ramsey's financial approach is mentioned, with criticism for his debt repayment strategy and the 12 percent rate of return assumption. It is believed that people can be trained to make financially sound decisions, but Ramsey's approach does not always achieve this. Other financial sources are recommended, such as Tadas Viskanta's aggregator website Abnormal Returns and Rit Holtz Wealth Management's content."

Like, obviously, so our audience is about 90% women. Our entire staff is women. Everyone's a woman, except for our one man. But so we obviously, being in this space and having that demographic make up, audience, and staff, like our perspective on this is also different. And it's kind of impossible not to notice that the vast, vast majority of other media properties, of other even just sort of movements within personal finance are extremely masculine. Profession is 83%. I mean, law, finance, all of it. And I do think some of that is just kind of self-perpetuating when more men are interacting. Of course, they bring their friends, whatever. But I do think a lot of this has sort of like an unspoken assumption in many approaches to personal finance and life planning that either assume the existence of a sort of unspoken domestic fairy who is handling an enormous amount of tasks around the home that are not maybe income generated. Yeah. Oh, I'll take it here. And listen, you want to have kids or you don't want to have kids. That's your prerogative. I'm not here to push. Me personally? No, not you personally. Anyone. I don't know your stance on this. And you never will. Fair enough. Retreating slowly. A lot of the articles about the couples and how they're doing on fire, I can't help us notice there are no kids involved in the situation, the particular situation. And again, that's your call if you wish to have kids or not. I'm not here to talk about that. But I am here to say that, yeah, it's a whole different financial ballgame. And the calculus changes. Or having to deal with maternity leave or the diminished earning potential of mothers or any of these things. All of that. Heather and I once, when we were pushing, we still lived in the city. We had Hazel here. And we were pushing her around in a stroller going for a walk. And Heather looks over at me and she goes, how much money would someone need to make in order for them to consider literally leaving their job and just raising the kid? Obviously, very geographically biased. We were talking about in Manhattan. And I back of the envelope, that number in my mind on our walk and it was $70,000. In other words, it would be more beneficial for a parent to stay home with their kid than hire a nanny in New York City and forgo a $70,000 salary. Because the cost of child care was so high or is so high. And we just looked at each other like, $70,000. That's a lot of money. That's a lot of money. You say that to a lot of people throughout the entire country. It's a huge sum of money. Anyways, I guess that's another critical point that I have about a lot of those stories that fall into the financial pornography, specifically around the fire movement. Yeah, there's perhaps a good dose of privilege in those things. You hear the, oh, it's all Silicon Valley bros cashing out from Uber or wherever they worked. And they're $35,000 and going fire. And it's like, OK. That's a choice. But listen, no matter how many dependents you do or don't have, you need to file those taxes, baby. Tax time is just around the corner. And maybe it's not your favorite topic to think about. But think of it this way. If you do it right and efficiently, you're about to get a little money back in the mail. And that always feels great. But in order to have that peace of mind when you're doing your taxes, you need to make sure that you are doing them properly and getting yourself the maximum refund that you're entitled to. So Intuit has created the perfect tool that you have probably heard of, even if you haven't yet used it, called TurboTax. Basically, TurboTax helps demystify and simplify all of the various elements of filing your taxes. It walks you through the process and helps ensure that you will get the maximum possible refund you are entitled to. And now they also offer TurboTax Live, where in addition to being walked through the process, you have access to their certified experts who will help answer questions, walk you through the process, and make sure that you are getting all of the money that is yours. And you communicate with them through one-way video chat, which means you get to reach them and see them, but they don't get to see you. So you can look like a mess, which I always love. If you're coming down to the wire on tax time and still haven't started, you should check out TurboTax at the link in our description or the show notes. It's funny. I often think about when we talk about looking at your life and your financial decisions through a prism of what you can live without, I think often that misses the point a little bit, because I think that still kind of centers around a perspective of deprivation and a perspective of abstinence. 100%. It's austerity. It's austerity. And I think it's much more healthy to get to a place where you're able to fully invest in the things that make you happy, and you no longer feel like the things you don't have are missing from your life in any way. I feel like a lot of people are deprived, but they still want that thing, if that makes sense. Well, let me ask this big question, perhaps, going kind of a call back to 20 minutes ago or so. What if they don't know what they really want for themselves? I think most people don't. Yeah. I think that people spend their entire lives trying to figure that out. But when you're cashing out and think you don't need to work, I don't know if that answers the question of, well, now what? And that was one of the other criticisms, was you find out they're still working. Or like, show me your blog now, and how to get clicks for money. And I think that kind of like, just to get into it a little bit more, that was an area of it that, so as a financial professional who can claim they're a financial expert, a lot of it started to then encroach on my territory, in a way. Where like, OK, you've done this thing. It was extreme. It worked for you. And now you're claiming to be a personal finance expert. And I'm cringing. I'm absolutely cringing over that. And I would be much happier. And this was spi-","The discussion covers several topics and is not focused solely on finance. However, some financial points are made, including the fact that personal finance media and movements are often dominated by men, and this can lead to an assumption that certain domestic tasks are being handled by women. The discussion also touches on the challenges of raising children and the cost of childcare, which can impact financial decisions. The hosts also mention the importance of proper tax filing and suggest using TurboTax for maximum refunds. Finally, the hosts talk about the importance of investing in things that make you happy rather than focusing on deprivation and austerity."

It's become almost like about the gamification of the number and a really sort of almost like a vacuum view of the number, completely devoid of what that number may entail in your actual life. And for many people, I know that if I earned twice what I was earning today, obviously that would imply a lot for everything around me and for everyone around me who's getting paid. And to get there, it would be easy for me to get there, but it would have a serious impact on my life. Like, I work a 40-hour week, and I would not be able to do that at that point, at least not right now. Correct. So I'm not so interested when people share that number. They're like, oh, I have a 4.5 million net worth. OK, what does your life look like? What are you actually getting out of that? Do you find that people who come to you are often very focused on the number or not focused enough on the number? I think they're focused on the thing I talked about that's difficult is finding the balance. I think the balance between what their lifestyle, that subjective lifestyle, what they deem to be comfortable in the context of their goals is what they're looking for. That function there allows them to not exist in a place that is defined strictly by the number. And I kind of want to call myself out a little bit on that and say, because they're high earners, they've already kind of blasted through the floor of sustaining life. And they know somewhere deep down, they're able to live a subjectively comfortable lifestyle anyways. On the other side of that coin is folks who make $750,000 and have very little to show for it, and folks that make $100,000 at a household and are crushing their goals. So you've got to be careful even with just putting it out there from the top line, from the income point of view. But I'm fortunate in that I'm working with folks that have already put themselves in a position to balance things out a little bit. But from a professional stance and even from what I'm putting out there stance, don't eat ramen noodle every night and say, yay, life is great if you can afford to live a more balanced life financially. Like, OK, so maybe you'll eat ramen three nights. Or maybe not at all. Maybe you guys will learn how to cook. Yeah, it's huge. It really is. And usually, if you get good at cooking food, it tastes real good. Can't deny that. Food does taste good. Yeah, big win. But yeah, maybe it doesn't need to be three nights, one night, whatever. It's knowing, now we come full circle to that cash flow, knowing what these decisions you're making around your money mean to you. Right. And again, connecting them to the goals. That's the format. And we don't put those things together usually. It's true. We don't. And I also feel like for so many people, and god, this is true of myself, even though I try to do everything I can to prevent it, lifestyle inflation is almost completely unavoidable. And it is so difficult for people to not calibrate that on a day-to-day basis and not see it coming. I don't think it's respected by a lot of people who, I'm not trying to do too much boomer bashing or older generation bashing here, but. Bash those boomers. OK, boomer. Grandma and Grandpa didn't have a data plan. That's true. They didn't. When they were storming the beaches of Normandy. Grandpa actually, he didn't do Normandy, but he served. And he did the whole deal. And I guess he peaked at VHS tapes. Elaborate on what you mean. What is the takeaway from Grandma and Grandpa not having a data plan? That there are expenses in our lives that are literally, they must be paid in order to live. Can you not have a data plan and function in 2020? Probably not. Not well. Not well. Yeah, and not if you want to create or be, not if you want to keep your productivity really low. So when you say inflation on the expense side, there's this one graph. Maybe we can find it. It shows the cost of TVs and cars. And then it's like college education and all the things that have gone up. And the Fed says there's no inflation. But there is. There truly is. And it's primarily from a lack of wage growth over the last 40 years. And that there are certain things that we need in our lives today that weren't needed 20, 30 plus years ago. But there's a lot of stuff that's not like that. There's a lot of stuff that's just pure, pure convenience or what you've gotten used to or what you now define as a need that even a month ago was a want and a month before that was unthinkable. By the way, fun fact, just before we started filming, I was like, I like your Vineyard Vines ties. Turns it around, it's Hermes. So clearly you're a man. That's a flex right there. That's a flex. I'm not going to deny it. But so clearly you're a man who likes nice things that you don't necessarily need. How do you keep a lid on that in the sense that you are not just letting it continually snowball to justify things that are not worth it? Yeah, so that's the nugget here of how people can live this lifestyle that they want. You have to remember, you have to keep your eye on the prize. And that's the goals that you want to achieve. Go ahead and judge. But if I'm executing on all of our goals to send kids to college or have a, so let me talk about this for a second. Talk about it. This is the first year that Heather and I will feel that we've earned the right to invest. To us, nothing was going to provide us more comfort in our own financial skin than having a very robust, we went for 12 months. 12 months. Of an emergency. Of living expenses, which, yeah. And then to your point, we like our lifestyle. We have big sacrifices that we make, namely vacations. We're always tacking our getaways on the heels of business trips and conferences, which for all of you who want to stay married a long time, don't keep doing that. Like actually go get a vacation. But that's been our big sacrifice. I mean, our last time we really traveled was our honeymoon six years ago. What? Yeah, like really traveled like that. Get out there. And well, Japan is the goal for our 10th anniversary in four years. The kids have to be old enough to actually like, Oh, you would go with the kids. I'm not going with the kids, but I can't leave. Oh. I can't. 100% not going with the kids. On that note, I do not want to travel with my kids. Until they can appreciate what we're doing. And we have a 10 month old now. So like it's going to take, I need Ruby to be Hazel's age before I can trust Grandma with them for 12 days. Because I'm not going to Japan on this epic trip that I've been waiting seven years of my life for to have to rush home after like four or five days. Totally. We're going all in on that. That's the, yeah. So that's like, OK, that's like a vacation goal. But I'm talking more about, hey, are we funding the retirement goal? We've worked so hard in the cash management space since leaving New York City for the suburbs. It meant being able to take advantage of low rates and refinance those student loans. Like there was a time that was an average 7 and 1 interest rate on those federal graduate plus loans. Now they're 3 and 1. Right. And instead of seeing a day where they're all paid off in my 60s, it's going to be while my kids are hopefully still under my roof. I can see that. I can feel that a lot more. That was all cash management that wasn't investing. That was building the cash reserve and taking bonuses and good months or good years or side deals for influencer or corporate partnership type stuff and doing that. And","The personal finance world has become too focused on net worth as a number, disregarding its impact on one's life. People should strive for balance between their subjective lifestyle and financial goals. Lifestyle inflation is unavoidable, but it is important to understand what expenses are necessary for living and what is pure convenience. Some things that are now considered needs were once wants or unthinkable. It is essential to make financial decisions based on goals and understand their impact. Strive for a balanced life financially and enjoy the things you can afford, but don't let it snowball."

And to your point, so he and I both feel, I mean, there's always recession talk. You can never time it. But we do feel that it's probably more likely than not in the next maybe two years that there'll be some kind of, well, something happening. So we're saying that for the last three years, right? But listen, we'd rather be saying, sorry, in this situation. But our approach to it is right now we're keeping a lot of cash, because if and when that recession hits, a lot of opportunity there, which is dark. But true. Very true. I think for us, the risk is more income risk, meaning the ability to make money than asset price risk, so the market dropping. If you can continue to make money and watch the markets fold 20%, 30%, certainly an opportunity. So if you're holding that big cash reserve and you feel good about your income, you can look to that cash as that opportunity. If you have a portion of your current investments in bonds, fixed income, you can rotate it out into stocks. So these are the conversations from a planning and investment management perspective, a little kind of look under the hood of the conversations we have with our clients and what we're just preparing them to think about, because things are good now. And they want to continue participating. But they also want to know and sleep well at night, knowing that if something were to happen, that they're prepared for it without creating an alarmist type situation. I guess it's using just the right amount of fear. Yes, but I also, I mean, I find it incredibly comforting to feel that we are going to the logical endpoint of our worst fears as a couple in the sense of, well, what if we're in a position where it's another 2008? And what if someone gets laid off? What if my company folds? All of these horrible things that you never want to think about, force yourself to think about them and then draft up a plan that would allow that to be manageable? I mean, that's how it's done. Yeah, that's it, man. I quit. You're it. I get aggravated by folks who don't want to take ownership over their life and literally say, this is what I want to do. And look, I can't live anyone's life for them. But there's so much you can do. And I don't know, for someone who does a lot, I almost want people to have that can-do attitude, that moment of, I can make this happen, which is opposite of that deprivation, austerity kind of thing, right? It's so much better. I think it's almost a positive light. And I will say, obviously, it's easier when you have a spouse because you're automatically a team. But we made that activity fun for ourselves. We were at this really pretty bar. We had cocktails. We got a really pretty new notebook. Half of the things were serious. Half of them were very serious financial decisions. But the other half was like, where are we going this year? And do we have any new hobbies that we want to pick up this year? So you can make it something that feels part of a fun activity. I want to touch on something that's really important right there for all of the couples out there who are trying to have money conversations. Even in my own relationship, timing is such a critical factor. In other words, the time that's set aside for this, I would encourage everyone to do exactly what you did. You created a space for this conversation to exist. Conversations around money are often emotional ones. It's hard to separate these two. I think it's one of the things that separates good advisors or good professionals are able to help people separate those two, the feelings of money versus just money. And what you did is you created that safe environment. Back to what I was saying in my own relationship, there are countless number of times we both have chosen the wrong time to talk about it. Yeah, like, don't do it right after a long day. Or late at night when everyone's tired, or the first thing in the morning on Saturday when you're just trying to kick it with the kids and watch cartoons. Yeah, make its own thing. Set a time and place. I remember she called for the state of the marriage summit when we went down to Florida. No one should ever do anything in Florida. Well, I grew up there. Oh, no, where? Boca Raton, Florida. I was born in West Palm Beach. Really? Yeah, Jupiter Hospital. Oh, my goodness. I was born in New York, but grew up down there in Florida. But were you from Long Island? My parents, my dad was from Harrison in Westchester, and my mom was Yonkers. But I was born in White Plains. I don't remember. We moved when I was two. There's like a speed channel between New York and my mom's family, too. It's the sixth borough. Yeah, it really is. We probably crossed each other in town center mall when we were kids. It's possible. 100% possible. You're a hair older than me, but it's possible. Thanks. Thank you. So in any event, now I lost focus on what we were doing. It was a good one. Creating that space. You were down in Florida having a state of the marriage summit. No, and it was a big convo. At Mar-a-Lago. Yeah, it was a big. It was in some restaurant that was terrible in Boca. We were going. Is there any other? I'm sorry. Jeez. Stop eating on Boca. So this was before our first daughter. I think we were having that real honest conversation about timing around kids and preparing ourselves to do that. And we were down for her college roommate's wedding in Miami. So we were just saying hi to my parents for the night before. And I think I believe we conceived Hazel that weekend. Whoa. Yeah. So yeah, that escalated fast. Wyatt, we need a separate bell for that. Yeah, ring. We have the bell for when people share a number and the bell for when someone's All I know is nine months after her friend Julia got married, we welcomed Hazel into the world here in New York City. Listen, I can't. Careful what these conversations might bring you, right? That's a first. But at least we had, though, in all seriousness, we had that conversation, obviously nine months before or anything. Right, right. Literally popped off. So at least we had that conversation and knew exactly what we'd be doing to handle the situation and welcome a child into the world. That's awesome. We had that conversation to not welcome a child into the world. Do you? So these are our rapid fire questions. Everyone interprets that word differently. So err to the shorter side, but if you need to go long on something, you can. Lightning round.","The discussion involves preparations for a potential recession and managing finances during good times. The speakers mention keeping a lot of cash and having a plan to manage income risk instead of asset price risk. They advise clients to prepare for the worst and make a plan to manage financial difficulties, including talking about money in a safe environment and creating a space to discuss financial decisions. The speakers also mention having fun while making serious financial decisions, including choosing new hobbies and travel plans. The conversation includes personal anecdotes about growing up in Florida and finding the right time and place to talk about money."

That only wealthy people can work with financial advisors and financial professionals? Out of curiosity, do you do a fee or commission structure? No commission, fee only. And do you have a sliding scale for people who maybe have less money? It's all based on complexity of plan. It starts with an annual financial planning fee. What is it? $2,000. But let me say this. Worth every penny. Probably. But the bigger thing is to make sure that people, before they would even spend a dollar working with any financial professional, know how to get the value out of them. And more importantly, know if they're ready to do financial planning. If they're not, they get free materials. And I'll see them later. And I want them to come back. Nice. Number two, what do you invest in versus what are you cheap about? Well, clearly, ties. Yeah. Invest in ties. Invest in yourself. I think I've spent the last 10 years investing in a business and myself and a brand and building this thing where, oh my god, there's no benchmark. You don't know how high or low you are. As a fellow entrepreneur here, when you yourself are your own benchmark, you can literally go insane at times. Invest in yourself and have that cash reserve. That's not an investment. That's cash. But I'll talk about there. And what was the second half of that? What are you cheap about? Yeah, we're cheap about it was denim. I never bought expensive jeans. Yeah, I never bought expensive jeans. That's changed. I think I already told you we're pretty cheap about the vacationing thing. That's more of a sacrifice than cheap. Man, I feel so the opposite. I would forego so many things before I would forego vacation slash travel. I think we regret it, honestly. But to some extent, there's regret. But I think we're much more happier with where we are right now in having done that. Number three, what has been your best investment and why? It's going to be lame if I'm like, myself again. Yeah, don't do that again. The best investment I've made is, here it is. I was going to be cheesy again and be like. Your wife? Yeah. I mean, it's fine. You could say that. I said my dog, actually, when I was one test. I'm going to stick with it, not for the cheese factor, but because truthfully, she's a North Star. But it's true. It just is true. Whenever I tell people, oh, I would just be lazy if I didn't have her. And they're like, OK, I don't like you because you're the least laziest person from the looks of it. But all I know is, we've been together for a very long time. And from 19 forward, I used to do one or two really stupid things a year in my adolescence. I was a really good kid, but there would just be that one thing, one time. What kind of thing are you talking about here? I got pulled over for going like 85 down A1A one night to get to a party with girls in the back. I thought I was hot shit. That is adorably tame. And the police chased me through two towns. And I didn't even know they were behind me. And by the time they caught up to me, it was a complete disaster. It was very embarrassing. It was a rough time. I should not. It was dangerous. It was just stupid. It was a really stupid thing to do. And stuff like that, like being a kid. But no, there were some pretty stupid decisions. And ever since I met her, going back many, many years now, these things never happen. She is just incredible at organizing everything in our lives, respectively. And because of that, I don't think the success that I've experienced would even exist. I tell people that all the time. I'm like, TFD would literally not exist without my husband because I didn't take in a salary for two years. And he paid for that by allowing me to live in his house. Also, he took months of ad hoc work to build out our ad infrastructure. She's taken jobs and made decisions in her career solely around allowing us to have the opportunity to invest in my business and get it to where it needs to be at the detriment of maybe more creative things that she would like to do. I know she loves what she does. But she's had her own sacrifices in that department. And I would love nothing more than to reciprocate that. Yeah, same. It always makes me feel so sad, though, that life is so rigged for married people. It's so unfair. If you are at a point in your life where it's maybe not necessarily in the cards for you any time soon, I don't know, find a platonic life partner so you guys can go in on each other's dreams because it's so much easier with another person. That support system pays massive dividends. Yes, and actually, you know what? To her credit, my co-founder Lauren, she lived on my couch for those four days a week that my husband was out consulting and quit her job to help build TFD, too. So my business partners are my platonic life partners, in a sense. Life is easier with the buddy system.","The discussion covers various topics related to finance and personal investments. The first topic discusses the perception that only wealthy people can work with financial advisors, and the importance of knowing the value of working with them. The second topic covers personal investments and what the speaker is willing to invest in (themselves) and what they are cheap about (vacationing). The third topic covers the speaker's best investment, which they jokingly suggest might be themselves or their spouse, but then go on to explain how their spouse has been a crucial support system for their success. They also suggest finding a platonic life partner for those who may not have a spouse to support them. The overall message is the importance of investing in oneself and having a strong support system."

As much as I've overcome 2008, I think that stigma, that fear, that catastrophe moment, it's really implanted pretty good. It also comes from family and watching businesses boom and bust and things like that. This is my sickness. This is why I go see therapy and really kind of create the space to own the success and the hard work you've done. Heather will always joke like, I'll have a great day, pick up a great client, secure a great deal. And she's like, are you happy? And I'm just like, no, because I don't know where the next one is.

You can build everything from that. Lastly, when did you first feel successful, quote unquote, and what does that word mean to you? I first felt successful when I survived 2008 working in finance and had just moved. I walked off- What were you doing? I walked off the plane. Same thing I'm always doing. Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah. I've only done this. The long story is I left my, the short version of the long story is I started my career working with my father and told him I didn't want to work in the family business, wanted to be with Heather, left October 2008 from South Florida to New York City. I think Lehman collapsed the day I got off the, when I got off the plane at JFK. I'm like, good job, Doug. You're going to work in finance in New York City. It looks like the economy is coming crumbling down. You really know how to pick them here. I think when I got to 2010 and I was still paying rent and an apartment and a paycheck was coming in, I said to myself, we're going to make a legitimate go at this. Nice. And the rest is history, as they say. Very cool. Out of curiosity, where did you go to school in New York? NYU Stern School of Business. Nice. All right. Well, listen, we certainly learned a lot about- About money summits in restaurants in South Florida and what happens. No, but this is always, I love talking to real money experts, as I am so decidedly not one. It's a breath of fresh air. You are welcome back anytime. Thank you. Where can our audience go to find out more about what you do and maybe even how to get in touch with you to work? Absolutely. You can Google Douglas Bonaparte and if the money I'm spending on SEO is working well, it will lead you to me. But I think the best place to connect is Twitter. I live there. And I'll see you next time. Bye. Bye.","The conversation touches on various topics related to finance.

202,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi4Vw_zafP4_sep_25_360,Fi4Vw_zafP4_sep_25_360,"Yeah, absolutely. Hi, this is Raj Abhisar Agarwal, speaking live from Denver, USA. It's like nine in the night here, 8.30 in the morning in India. And right now I'm here for a job. I'm working as a performance analyst at one of the Morgan Stanley subsidiary in wealth management. I recently completed my master's like a couple of months ago from Boston University in economics. And as Preet said, I was his senior in culture. So I did my econ honors from there. Back in 2018, I started there and 2021 I graduated in the middle of lockdown. And one of the reasons why I'm here is because like also like I'm also a content creator on Instagram, not anymore. Like I had to like, because of my professional job, I had to like deactivate my page. But I reached around 50, 52,000 followers and finance is like my go to place my bread and butter. And yeah, that's pretty much about me. So yeah, he has a lot to talk about when we talk about his introduction. So as we as you talked about your finance, content creator journey, I would like to first ask you how was that? Why did you initially start? And how does it actually feel like to have that ability to be able to influence such a large number of people with your content? On his pocket. So I'll be like crystal clear and honest here, totally honest. I started it like just because like during the lockdown, I had like so much free time, obviously, people didn't have anything to do colleges were like completely online. I really didn't know what to do. So I just started reading about like stock market and finance. Some of my friends, they were like, you know, we invested money, we are making money. So I was like, yeah, let's just try. And when I started like, you know, deep diving into it, I was the same person who didn't even know what is stock market before lockdown. And during the lockdown, I just became a finance person. But anyway, I noticed one thing on that, you know, they're like a lot of news and a lot of information on a daily basis, which is very normal and very important news, but it is missed by a lot of people, people don't pay attention to the news, or they're not enough sources for, you know, getting that information. So I just wanted to bridge that gap to add that value. And, you know, simplify finance, you know, spreading financial literacy, because I understood that, because earlier, I understood that finance and law, these are two fields, which are made complicated than they actually are in order to just make money, you know, you can throw away all jargons in investing and stuff, but trust me, it is supposed to be simple, people just make it complicated. So with that aim in mind, in mind, and with a lot of free time, I just started this content creation journey. And coming to the second part of the question that how it feels like to influence people. Trust me, when I started, I just started out of nowhere. I didn't have any tool, I had a basic camera, I even didn't know what to speak, what to do. I was having a very serious, you know, face and I was recording videos, it went nowhere. But after a couple of months, when I saw the engagement, when I saw that, hey, something is going on, and people started like reaching out to me, I started gaining followers. It was one of the best feelings that hey, I'm being able to help. I since day one, I made sure that I reply to each and every follower, which is like very rare. A lot of finance influencers won't even reply to any day, like ever. But I used to talk to people, I used to help them, I used to guide them in any manner possible. And it was a very good feeling. Trust me, I felt empowered. I feel, I felt like, you know, that I'm being able to make a difference in people's life. And that really is priceless. Trust me, money is not a not a thing. Money can be earned in different ways. But this value, this respect, this confidence is like priceless for sure. Absolutely. And like there's the dialogue in this vitamin movie that with more power comes more responsibility. So I believe it was more like that as well, because you're also in a domain like finance where you cannot be wrong. Absolutely. Because like finance is one of the places where you know, if you help someone to make money, they will make you that quarter. Okay. But if by chance just once if they lose money because of you, they will curse you really bad in seconds, you know, so yeah, you need to be like really sensitive and really, really, you know, transparent when it comes to like finance. Right, right. And as you talked about, you know, helping out other creators as well, they reached out to you for help. Are there like certain two or three key advices or suggestions that you tend to usually give people who just starting out? All right, so not only I help creators, but like random followers too, but about creators, if you want to like get two, three suggestions for me, from me to about when to like while starting out, I would say like, first of all, consistency is the key. Like there will be days, there will be like probably weeks or months well, when the content will not go up, you'll feel so dejected, you'll feel like you know, I'm wasting my time, nothing is happening, nobody's recognizing my value. But trust me, consistency is the key. Slow and steady wins the race. That's my motto when it comes to content creation and even in life. And second, I would say it's about quality over quantity any day, you might not want to post a single video every day, post probably two a week, but make sure that you put your heart and soul into it. And third, I would say, you know, try to solve a problem, like try to like create content, which is relatable to people, you know, since day one, you know, make a content, which is like, you know, which gives incentive to people to share it with others. There are like a lot of reels where you will see and you'll be like, okay, I'll just scroll through it. But there will be some reels where you would want to share it with one of your friends, like some sort of hacks or some sort of like, you know, explaining some jargon in like a simple language. So yeah, these three things, consistency, quality over quantity and relatable content is like the go to things I would say.","The discussion is about a finance content creator, Raj Abhisar Agarwal, who is also a performance analyst at a Morgan Stanley subsidiary. He started creating content on Instagram during the lockdown to bridge the gap between important finance news and the lack of information sources available. His aim was to simplify finance and spread financial literacy. Raj mentions that finance and law are made complicated to make money, but they are supposed to be simple. He enjoys being able to help his followers and replies to each and every one of them. Raj advises consistency as the key to success for creators starting out. He also mentions the importance of transparency and sensitivity in the finance domain since one wrong advice can have a significant impact on someone's investment."
203,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi4Vw_zafP4_sep_388_741,Fi4Vw_zafP4_sep_388_741,"What were the two or three books that changed the game or changed the way you, you know, perceived finance for you and a few learnings from those books that have struck out through the journey? So interesting thing here, I've never been a book reader. Okay. I hate to say it, but it is what it is. Like I literally used to hate reading books. I never like, you know, before lockdown, I never even finished a single book, which is not academic. Okay. So I will, I used to be the person who used to love reading subtitles, but not books. That's not, you know, but just like during lockdown, one of my friends, he's like, I just suggested that, Hey, you know, just read this book. It's called Rich Dad, Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki. I'm pretty sure everyone has heard of it. It's like really famous, but I just started that book. And you know, for the very first time in my life, within three days, that was like a small book, not a very big, it's like this big, but it's like has, it has like 250, 300 pages. I completed in like, like in just two, three days and everything changed there. That was like the spark, the initial spark, the, the, you know, inception point for me to like, you know, get into this field, deep dive into it, because like I read the power of, you know, having financial literacy, what is a passive income, how you should develop it and how you cannot grow as a person, like, you know, financially, if you do not have like multiple sources of income. So this, that Poor Dad became like my go-to book. It became my favorite book and it was my start, you know, so that book is like must read if you still haven't read it. And if you haven't read it, you might want to look into different books by Robert Kiyosaki. He's like a legend, according to me. Second, again, it's like a common book, but trust me, if you still haven't read it, it's called Psychology of Money by Morgenthausen. It doesn't matter what your field is. It doesn't matter if you don't even know what F in finance stands for, but it is simple book. You will totally, totally get it. And then one of my favorite investors, his name is Peter Lynch, not very famous, like people tend to stick to Warren Buffett, but I prefer Peter Lynch over Warren Buffett any day. So yeah, his book, it's called Beating the Street. He has written like a couple of books, Beating the Street could be like a little high level if you are starting new, but Beating the Street is like a hardcore finance investing stock market book. And I really, really like that. And yeah, I could like keep, you know, naming tons and tons of books. And just like these were like hardcore money in finance, but I would also like to mention one book, which like, which is like more of self-help, which is like really, really motivational and it will, it might really put like have a big impact on you. It's called Good Wives, Good Life by Wex King. It's like a small read, but it's like a very impactful and very beautiful read. And I just, you know, texted Wex King personally on Instagram about like, thank you for the book and he liked my message. So that counts. But yeah, that's, that's a great book. If you are not into like a lot of academia, if you are into like, you know, more of self-help and life, that's a very good book. Great. Glad to hear that. Regarding, I also had a similar incident. I recently finished the book Factfulness. So I was also so intrigued. I, I tried to connect with the authors out of the three or two were still alive. The father died. The three people wrote the book. So I texted, I tried to connect with the other two people on LinkedIn. I connected with one of them and she applied a thanks to my message. So even I had that feeling and it was great. So yeah, that's great. And recently, like, you know, I was like in a part of a lucky draw and there I won a psychology of money signed copy by Marvin Haussler. Like, yeah, so that's like my price position. I'm going to keep it always with me for sure. He doesn't know who I am, who am I, but still I have that book signed by him. Great. Yeah, that's a souvenir for your forever. You can probably get it framed or, you know, so that it doesn't even wear away. Great. Exactly. Great. Now, another question, Raj, being what is your understanding or your perspective of wealth? Okay, so yeah, so wealth is like, you know, it is treated as same as money. It is treated the same as being rich. But I just feel that, you know, wealth is more not about being rich. It's more about having the freedom to do things that you want. Like it's not that simple. People just think, okay, freedom, whatever. But no, it's not that. Being rich is the first step to become wealthy, but being rich and being wealthy is not the same. You know, making money than others makes you rich, but making more money than others and keeping that money in your family for generations, investing that money properly so that it becomes like a passive income. It makes it gives you freedom to do anything you want with your life is actually being wealthy. So, you know, coming from a business class family early on from my life, I like dinner The dinner talks during my house were like, you know, around interest rates, business, money. So since childhood, I had that upbringing in such a manner that I got a very good essence of money and wealth and so very big. So yeah, I have like a very deep relationship with money. Well, like a lot of people say that money is not everything. Money is not everything. I disagree. I trust. Trust me when I say it. Like I personally believe money is everything, to be honest, like even Warren Buffett, one of his like quotes, like one of my favorite quotes, he says that, you know, anyone who's like money is not everything, he says money is not everything. Make sure you earn a shitload of money before saying such nonsense. So that's like one of the most impactful quote, which like changed my perspective that even that person says that money is like important because in India, we all look down on, you know, being try to making more money. Children are asked not to talk about money, but I just disagree. You know, there's like obviously a limit to it, but you should not refrain your children or people who are young to talk about money. You should let them participate. You should make them understand. You should teach them about money, taxes, accounting, whatever. So yeah, according to me, being wealthy and being rich is like very big different thing.","The discussion revolves around books that have changed the way the speaker perceives finance. The speaker mentions that they used to hate reading books but read ""Rich Dad, Poor Dad"" by Robert Kiyosaki during the lockdown and it changed everything for them. This book taught them about the power of financial literacy, passive income, and the importance of having multiple sources of income. They also recommend ""Psychology of Money"" by Morgan Housel, ""Beating the Street"" by Peter Lynch, and ""Good Wives, Good Life"" by Wex King. When asked about their perspective on wealth, the speaker explains that wealth is not just about being rich, but also about having the freedom to do what you want. They believe that being rich is the first step to becoming wealthy, but the two are not the same thing."
204,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi4Vw_zafP4_sep_825_1145,Fi4Vw_zafP4_sep_825_1145,"want to understand from you as a finance content creator, how to be, how should people view spending and what is your take on that? See I just feel like there's no perfect formula or like a magic thing which I could tell because like when it comes to spending and when it comes to interest, experiences and like you know priorities, it's like very subjective according to someone, according to people to people you know. For example, I might spend say $100 on a football match while a person would like even not pay $10 for the same you know. So people have like interest and priority but speaking from a general perspective, I would say that luxury has no upper limit and being young, you should stay away as much as you can from luxury things. I'm not saying there's a big difference between being comfortable and being luxurious. People just say that you know, you how much money will you save, if you are living like that or no, be comfortable, like make sure that you are meeting all your ends, you are not struggling anywhere, you're not sacrificing your basic needs. But then when it comes to luxuries, when it comes to like you know, eating outside, going on vacations, like spending money on the phone or like whatever electronics, then that's where you want to like you know, try to save a little and I just feel you know, spending is also like you know, even if you are spending for example, you say hey, this is a particular level of lifestyle, I can't live below it. Now during like to maintain that lifestyle also you can like you know, do a lot of smart things for example, like you know, credit cards is one thing which people do not understand like according to me, credit cards is one of the dangerous, the most dangerous financial tool ever created, dangerous because if you use it properly, you can make so much money. But if you do not use it properly, you can literally go broke, you can literally go broke. So people don't understand that even with the same amount of spending, you can spend it very well. You can you know, like for example, in the US, people don't understand that for example, if you come to the US, you open a bank account with like JP Morgan Chase or Bank of America, you will get a 0.1% interest or probably 0% interest. That's how it works here, right? The top five, six times that they have a monopoly of 0% interest. But at the same time, if you just do a little bit research and you go to banks like Citi, you go to banks like Capital One or SoFi, they will give you 3.5 to 4% interest. That's free money. That's free money. Why not do that? You know, so some similarly in India, if you have a SBI bank account, while you have a versus you have an IDFC first bank or Bandhan bank account, you will get a 2 or 3% interest difference nowadays. So do those small things, get the best credit cards, try to maximize your you know, all the cashbacks which you can get. So I would say for this thing, like, you know, spending smartly, trying not to spend much on like luxury things, because I just feel, you know, reap the benefits later. Sacrifice now, save now and save later. I'm not saying like, you know, being that boring person sitting at home, not really like, obviously experiences are really important. Go in a concert once in a while, go to a club once in a while, that's fine. But you know, there should be a limit, there should be a hard line. And you should have like that motivation and that discipline where you know that, hey, this is getting too much, this is getting out of hand. And I would say like last thing, budgeting is also very important. For example, in the beginning of the month, just say that this is my limit, I can't spend over it. And tracking your expenses is one of the like, you know, most underrated advice. Last year in January 2020, 2022, I started tracking every single dollar which comes out of my pocket and which comes in my pocket. And since then, I'm so much aware of my money. I'm being able to like, you know, spend very intelligently when I see that, hey, last month, I spent $300 eating outside, this month, I'll try to be a little frugal. So I end up spending like say, 210. So that makes a big difference, you know, but at the same time, if you don't know how much did you spend last month, you might end up spending more this month than last month, you know. So budget tracking, being frugal, not spending on luxuries, spending smartly, a lot of things go in it. Superb. Yeah, I was also wanting to know, glad it came out of your conversation itself. Are there certain applications or certain software that you use to track or how do you track or how would you suggest people to budget? It is very simple. It is very simple. I don't use any software. I don't use any application. I just use Google Sheets. That's it. Google Sheets is always open in my laptop, Google Chrome in one tab. And the fact that I don't use Excel, I use Google Sheets because Google Sheets is also linked to my phone. So in case I forgot to, you know, put an entry in my laptop, I can like do it on my phone instantly. Excel can't be linked online. So just Google Sheets. I have a basic template and I made it myself. It has categories like, for example, eating outside, groceries, necessities, transportation, electricity, like something like this. And then it totals everything up. It shows me my fixed costs. It shows me my luxury spending. It shows me my total spending. And then like there are basic formulas like sum and all that, like anybody could do it. So very, very simple. It will take you like two or three minutes to set that Google Sheet up. And every month I just copy, paste it for the next month, clear all the entries and start putting the new entries. As simple as that. Now you said it so simply. Makes it prover for everyone because even I was wondering and pondering on, you know, looking for various applications. I've met people, you know, we've had discussions on, you know, what app to use for budgeting and things are getting out of hand. So I think that's an eye opener in a way that it's that simple. And using Google Sheets can be a good, efficient way.","The discussion revolves around how to view and manage spending in a smart and effective way. The speaker suggests being frugal and avoiding overspending on luxury items, while still allowing for experiences and entertainment within reason. They also recommend budgeting and tracking expenses using a simple tool like Google Sheets. The speaker warns about the dangers of credit cards but highlights the potential benefits if used responsibly, and encourages people to seek out higher interest rates from alternative banks. Overall, the approach is to sacrifice now and save for later while still enjoying life within reasonable limits."
205,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi4Vw_zafP4_sep_1228_1650,Fi4Vw_zafP4_sep_1228_1650,"that's out of the way. Now, why should I as an investor, what is the incentive that I have to do my own research and not just go for certain stocks that some professional has recommended? Yeah, that's a great question for sure. Yeah, I would totally agree that yeah, we have like very less incentive to do our own research. But now coming to Nitin Kamath, last year earned 100 crore rupees as salary. Okay. So just imagine that type of risk appetite he has, even if he lose like, say, 5% of his money that does 5 crore, it still leaves him with 95 crore rupees. I don't think as students, we even have like 95,000 rupees to invest, right? So now we have to, we obviously can't keep ourselves in the same boat. And obviously, I do understand that being in finance, I should talk about percentage terms and not absolute terms. Five crores is not the right thing. Five person is the right thing because he will lose 5%. We will also lose 5%. But again, his risk appetite will be really different. He knows what he's doing. He might sell and you might even not know you might keep holding the stock till like whatever time and you might lose your money. At the same time, he's in a different phase of his life. He does it full time. There are so many things that you can differentiate between him or like any professional fund manager or any person who's coming on the news or like, you know, just telling me that, he might himself not be buying like Nitin Kamath won't lie, but a lot of finance influencers, they will tell you that, hey, I'm buying this stock, but there's no proof and they will never prove it to you. So that's where it comes. Your own research is very important because if you don't know, if you don't understand why you put the money in the purse in this thing, you will never know when to sell, when to exit. You will never be able to resist that temptation. If it goes down, you might end up selling. If it goes up, you might end up selling where you had to stay in it or where you had to exit. So I would say that if you really, really are serious about money, if you do not have a lot of risk appetite, because see, I don't have a lot of risk appetite. I am very sensitive when it comes to money. I like taking small risks, but calculated risk. There are people who take big risks, probably go ahead, go crazy, like do Google search, like, you know, top 10 stocks, ask Chad GP, but that's not me because I know that I can't lose money when it comes to investing, when I can spend some time. See, at the same time, me not being a finance influencer, speaking from a person who was like three years ago, who doesn't even know what is stock market, who just knows the basic, even if you can't research and probably you might be an engineer, you might be a doctor, you might be a lawyer, finance is not your field. Warren Buffett has said over the years and stats has also proved that majority active fund managers lose to passive fund management. Okay. What does that mean? The people who are buying individual stocks are not being able to even beat the returns of the market index itself. So if you can't understand, if you can't pick stocks, if you do not understand what's happening behind, if you don't have the time to research or have the risk appetite, just buy the index. Buying the index is one of the simplest things you can do. You can do a monthly SIP, you can do a weekly SIP and just keep putting the money in the index and you're good to go. The Nifty index has given like an average of 12 to 13% returns in the last 20 years. If you put money in S&P 500, you can get eight to 10% returns in the last 20 years. So you can like do a whole basket of stocks. And now people would say that, hey, index investing is like so boring. Now you can make it more interesting in certain ways. I have done it. So how do I do it? So for example, in the U S there are like a couple of indexes. Okay. There's S&P 500, which tracks the performance of 500 top stocks in the U S. There's Dow, DJIA, Dow Jones Industrial Average that tracks only 30 stocks. Then there's NASDAQ, which is highly tech oriented and that tracks these performance of 32 or 3300 stocks. And then there is Russell 2000, Russell 3000, Russell 1000, which have very small cap stocks. So now all of these indexes have different types of weightages, have different types of calculating methods and different types of companies and stocks in them and different riskiness level. So that's where you can make a basket of index portfolio, like a portfolio where you have a basket of indexes. So probably like, you know, put 50% money in S&P 500, put 20% in NASDAQ. If you are too risk lover, you can put 50% in Russell 2000. So that's how it becomes interesting, you know, because I get it that, you know, investing is boring. And Warren Ruppert has also even said that, you know, investing is more like seeing grass grow or seeing paint dry. It is boring. Nobody can do that. So in order to make it interesting, you can probably try to do these things and it can actually try to end up making you more money for sure. I think that's wonderful advice and really informative for me as well. And since you also mentioned chat GPT in the conversation, I had a question around the AI boom that has recently happened. So have you observed certain implications or certain factors, field of finance or the field of investing certain implications or certain benefits that or certain ways that you know, AI can be leveraged in finance or pertaining to the field? 100% see AI has both its pros and cons and it's going to change the world for sure. But it is I just personally feel it's too early and we just don't know even in the six months, everything might change. For example, like a couple of weeks ago when like Satya Nadella, the Microsoft CEO, when he was like introducing chat GPT to the world, he tried to do a basic stock analysis between two very famous stocks in the US. And to do an analysis, chat GPT was trying to get the EPS of these two shares. Now what is EPS? EPS is basically earnings per share. That's one of the good metrics to compare these two stocks. And those two EPS were like wrong and they were off by like 10, 20%. So now that's like a big blunder. The problem with chat GPT is that it tells you the answer directly, but it never tells you the source, right? On Google, if you like do a Google search, you'll see the source and you can choose that, hey, okay, the Wall Street Journal is like a good website. It won't have wrong information. Probably Forbes won't have the wrong information, but this random blog might have wrong information, right? So you can do a little bit of selection there. So the problem with AI right now with chat GPT is that you just never know what it is telling you. And even the founder of chat GPT, like recently last week in one of the interviews he said that I am afraid of my own founding that it might be used to spread a lot of disinformation on a mass level. So for example, somebody does a stock analysis on chat GPT and it does it wrong. And it says there's a thousand X potential in the stock and people might, it becomes a mass news. People might end up buying it and losing all the money. But at the same time, a lot of good things are also coming. People are saying that, hey, we will lose our jobs and everything. Yeah, there is a threat for sure, but I just feel that after a certain point, machine won't be able to replace you if you have the skills, if you have that mindset. And at the same time, when it comes to people's skills, being that person, being the charming person, being a helpful person, being a humble person, AI can never do that. AI can never do that.","The discussion revolves around the importance of doing your own research in investing rather than relying on recommendations from professionals. The risks that professional investors and fund managers take are much larger than that of individual investors. Doing your own research is important because it helps you understand why you invest in a particular stock, which enables you to make informed decisions on when to sell and when to hold. The majority of active fund managers lose to passive fund management, indicating that buying the index is a simple and effective way to invest. An index portfolio can be created to make investing more interesting by putting money in various indexes with different weightages, calculating methods, and risk levels."

So being a person is very important right now. But I would say that there are very good benefits as well. I recently saw like a couple of days ago that Chad GPD has launched something which is taking over all the Microsoft apps, for example, Excel, Word, PowerPoint, Outlook. So what will happen is that you can just type, hey, make me a slide presentation on, for example, you are in a meeting with your boss and a client and whatever happened in the meeting, you can just say Chad GPD on Outlook that hey, make the notes. Before the meeting ends, it will give you the precise notes that what happened in the meeting. Now you will say, hey, just make a presentation of these notes. 10 slides in a second for you right there. Two days worth of job in seconds. So these things will become like really helpful and really easy. And yes, this will eat jobs. Like the number of analysts which companies hire might go down. But again, you need to have that inside. It's like now more than ever where you need to be like, you know, know your stuff and you know, super specialization. But I would say again, both pros and cons kind of too early, probably too late. Not sure about it. We'll find out. We surely will. We surely will find out. And yeah, delving into the discussion about jobs. We know how we're hitting a recession. Or as people say, we know that there was a report that I read a few days ago by OECD. So the global trade outlook, they're predicting that, you know, the global trade is also slowing down. And I've also observed a negative air around people and their perception of their own jobs. So I had a discussion with a few people, they were very, and you know, they were very cautious of making a shift because they were feeling like this recession might impact their existing jobs as well. And they wouldn't probably want to take that risk. So what is your understanding of how the recession is hitting and how will it impact jobs here in India and probably in the US as well? So yeah, this is like a very wide topic. And I happen to have like a lot of knowledge on this, for example, like I've been reading a lot. So it's a very famous saying that if you ask an economist when a recession is coming, the answer will always be six months. So a recession is always six months away, no matter when you ask an economist. Okay. So that is actually, I've been here since like, 2022, January, that we are going to hit a recession in next six months, next six months, next month, we are in 2023. And the first quarter is also about to get over in the US. And we still haven't been like officially into a recession. At the same time, I also feel that, hey, when you are in a recession, you don't even know it. For example, right now, speaking at this point, we might already be in a recession, banks have started to fail in the US, right? So I think that recession is like just a very overrated term, bad economic phenomena, it itself is as bad as a recession itself. So you don't need to tell people, hey, that hey, wake up this morning, the session has started. No, it might be already been there since like last three months. But you know, it just creates a sort of panic, it creates a sense of, you know, danger and like, you know, not a scared feeling. So I would say that not to talk about recession a lot is like a B is actually smart. But again, academia when it comes to RBI, when it comes to Federal Reserve, they need to use these jargons in order to like, you know, inform the public very well. And when it comes to jobs, I would say that hey, some of the industries obviously have been hit like really bad. You've seen IT like this past weekend only like yesterday, as in sure, like announced a 2.5% layoffs of the entire workforce, which is like 1000s and 1000s of jobs. So obviously, I won't deny that things are like really bad. It also depends on which type of which type of industry you are in. For example, in the US, if you see past job data, like since a couple of months, the job market is still very tight, even after layoffs of like 50,000 or 60,000 people accumulated from all these tech tech companies. Still people are getting jobs, but those jobs are like probably in different sectors. There's there's there are jobs in hospitality, management, administration. Obviously, you can compare these two. But on an economy level, there are still jobs, job market is still tight. And I love to say that Indian markets, Indian economy, as an individual economy, still is doing very, very well. Even the past year when S&P 500 was down 16%, Nifty was just down 2%, which is very, very, very bad, because these two are generally correlated. And US being the world economy, it's just like, you know, have this have that impact on every other economy. And at the same time, the commentary by RBI, the inflation rates in India, it's been doing pretty, pretty good. Even like right now, if you ask me that, where should I put my money Indian or US market, I would any any day say like, you know, 60% India, 40% US probably just for the sake of diversification. So I would say in India, there will be a job crunch a little bit not as bad as the US, IT is being hit, IT will be hit. But again, it all goes away before we know it. When people actually you know, it is announced that recession has started. Technically, according to economic indicators, and not just blabbering out, according to past data, things are already starting picking up when we announced a recession has started. So basically, probably today is recession. If you are thinking that, hey, after three months, I should do this, probably do it today. But I would just say that if you are good enough, if you have the right skill set, if you are a confident person, a confident person, a confident person,","The discussion revolves around the impact of AI on jobs and the current state of the global economy, particularly in India and the US. While AI is expected to replace certain jobs, it also brings benefits such as automation of tasks. The conversation touches on the topic of recession, and how it can create panic and uncertainty, even though it may not be immediately evident. The job market has been affected in some sectors, such as IT, but there are still opportunities available in other areas. The Indian economy is doing relatively well, with the Nifty index performing better than the S&P 500 in the US. The discussion ends with a question on whether to invest in the Indian or US market."
207,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi4Vw_zafP4_sep_2148_2334,Fi4Vw_zafP4_sep_2148_2334,"to know from you certain investment philosophies of your certain strategies of your certain things that you always keep in mind or you would like to recommend to people starting out probably the simplest and the most important thing according to me is to keep it simple. Keep it simple. I see a lot of people you know, you know, like they're trying to make investing complicated. It is not complicated. It is as complicated as you make it, you know, so you don't have to like, you know, track 10 type of different things. You don't need to have two, three screens. You need to have, you don't need to have like all those charts and like patterns and what not. Just be aware of your surroundings. Just try to understand that the thing which you are putting money in, do you understand that company, that particular stock or not? You know, if you just right now look around in your room, you will find a lot of companies which have those products, right? A majority of those companies will be public companies. That means they have a stock. If you are a customer, you already understand that product. You already have a sense of belongingness. So that's the starting point. I won't say that because you are a customer of company by the stock. No, hell no. But that's a starting point, you know, and then it never hurts you to learn basic fundamental analysis. And it's like a very hard term to listen, but it's not very like tough. You know, it doesn't matter where you come from, which field you are from. It's never tough to read a balance sheet. It's never tough to like, you know, interpret a financial statement like a profit and loss statement or a cash flow statement. Even if you just do a basic Google search on, go to investopedia.com, they teach you everything in like a very basic language. So I would just say that keep it simple. Try not to complicate it. Always make sure that you are investing money in something which you understand. Do not fall for like, you know, FOMO. Do not fall for FOMO. Like I have seen so many people losing so much money just because, you know, everyone is putting the money, let me put it too. And they all go crashing down. Like Adani Stores is one of the biggest example. Like people have lost so much money there and people have made so much money as well. I'm not saying that people didn't make money, but it majorly people who make money are full time traders and institutions. The retail investor on an average, they lose money always when it comes to FOMO. So nothing, I don't have any sort of technique. And I wouldn't even call myself as like a very big or grave investor. No, even I'm learning. I'm like too young to like, you know, comment on this. But again, having a long term mind, being disciplined, being consistent, like, you know, not being panicking that, that, you know, investing is less about knowledge and more about you as a person being disciplined, being you know, consistent. That's really, very important. So again, it's a very boring task. It's like watching grass grow, just to repeat myself and yeah, just keep at it. And if you're doing it in the first place, you are again ahead of majority people in our country because hardly anyone invests. And if they even if they do, they're just thinking short term, they're just thinking, try to like, you know, be become rich quick, nobody becomes rich quick. And if they do, either they were just too lucky or they did something unethical. So I just feel that being rich is being rich quickly is like just out of the playbook, according to me.","The discussion advises people to keep their investment strategies simple and not to complicate things. It suggests investing in companies whose products they already understand as customers and to learn basic fundamental analysis. The speaker warns against falling for FOMO (fear of missing out) and emphasizes the importance of having a long-term mindset, being disciplined, and consistent. The speaker also advises against trying to become rich quickly and highlights the importance of patience and perseverance in investing."

So quickly, a zero-based budget is what we teach. It's your income for the month minus all of your expenses including giving and saving should equal zero. So go download every dollar. It's like he said because there's great tutorials on that. But honestly, make it a habit of being intentional with where your money's going. It gives you peace and it is your choice. No one tells you what you have to put on the paper. You decide and you are now in control. It's an old 90s word. You are empowered. The budget empowers you. It's overworked, overused word. But you know, we want to empower people. But that's what the budget does. It gives you power. You are empowered over the subject that is such a debilitating, shame-inducing subject. Absolutely. But give such peace and clarity. All right, number two, budget for inflation. So inflation is something that we've experienced a lot in 2022. We're experiencing now. And so budgeting is going to help you period in your life. Like what we're talking about, number one, because it's actually going to give you a margin. We find that people say when I budget, I actually feel like I got a raise. So that in turn is going to help you combat inflation. But there probably are going to be things that you're going to have to cut. You know, I feel like we're so used to in our world today, these things that we think are needs that are actually wants. And I'm not talking about just going and like splurging on a new pair of shoes. But I mean, it's everything from like subscriptions, if there's like delivery services, like these things that we have in the rhythm of our lives, that there's times it's like, okay, if the budget is tight, there are things that you will have to cut in order to make the math work and specifically magnify because of inflation. So inflation is something that we've talked about a lot this past year. But it's it's affecting people's budgets and you feel it. And so you do have to adjust for it. I think the way to get your mind around it is the easiest way for me is this. When we first started helping people with their money, we were primarily working with people in extreme distress. They're almost in foreclosure. Five pounds payments behind their two car payments behind their have lost a job. They've got extreme financial stress. Okay, how do you fix that budget? What do you do with that? Well, your budget becomes the on and off switch between needs and wants. And you have to take care of your needs first food, shelter, clothing, transportation and utilities. We always call it keep the four walls of your house up, right? If you take care of those needs, and you go Okay, I'm warm. I'm fed. I have shelter. The car has gas in it. But it does have gas in it, right? You know, all of that, I can kind of relax. Because I'm not going to be homeless. I'm not going to be then the then I can look at the wants and go, well, this is a monopoly game. And it's not going so well. On the ones I got to cut some stuff out. So but if you try to just pile in their, you know, food, as opposed to Netflix, one's a necessity and one's a want, you know, and then you go, ah, your brain just starts to explode with anxiety with stress. And you start to be overwhelmed. And then you start screaming at the TV and at the politicians to get this fixed, because you're now a victim of the thing. But when you take control of the necessities, it allows your body as Dr. John Delaney would say to relax. Yep, absolutely. And your shoulders to drop. And then the rest of it is like, well, this sucks, but I can still work it through. Yep. All right. Speaking of people not waiting or waiting on the government to fix everything. Number three, do not wait on student loan forgiveness. You guys, if you have student loans, be paying on them. Okay. And this is kind of a controversial subject because we talk about all the time. We're empty. We want you to be debt free, but we don't want you waiting on someone else to do it. Because let's be honest, when you wait on Washington and you're waiting on everything to happen, may not, probably not, could not happen. But 100% sure if you pay off your debt, that will happen. And so this is something that a lot of people, I mean, I've talked to a lot of people and it's like, I'm going to just wait and see. But here's another thing, too. If you do pay it off and you want to get in the system and they pass it and it actually goes through and everything, you can get a refund. You can apply for that. Maybe. But this idea of waiting, because it sounds good, right? If you are $40,000 in student loan debt and they're like, yeah, we're going to pay some of that off for you. It's like, well, that sounds great. Instead of me going and getting an extra job, cutting expenses, that sounds a whole lot better. But the hard thing is, those promises are not usually kept. That's what's hard. Well, they either couldn't keep them or had no intention of keeping them from the start, depending on your political view and your view of the people in office. And so, why are you being played by this subject? Why are you being, for what, four years we've been talking about this and now it has come down to it as an unkept political promise at this stage? Well, I understand.","he discussion covers three points related to personal finance. Firstly, the importance of budgeting, specifically a zero-based budget where one's income for the month minus all expenses including savings and giving should equal zero. The budget empowers individuals to be intentional with their money and gives them control over their finances. Secondly, budgeting for inflation is essential to combat its impact on one's finances. This requires cutting down on non-essential expenses and focusing on needs such as food, shelter, clothing, transportation, and utilities. Lastly, individuals should not wait for student loan forgiveness from the government and instead pay off their debts as waiting may not guarantee any forgiveness."
209,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7ogu99lOyk_sep_530_678,J7ogu99lOyk_sep_530_678,"They're still talking about it, but that's all they're doing is talking. And again, back to our earlier thing, how do you fix your life? You fix your life. You don't wait on someone else to fix it. It's the best formula. Oh, and by the way, you signed paper that said you were gonna pay it back. There's that too. There's that too. All right, number four, pay off your debts. We're talking about student loan debt, but we're gonna talk about all the debts. So, being debt-free, I feel like that's one of the cornerstones of Ramsey Solutions. It's one of the things that I feel like we're known for the most. But you guys, when you have the ability to pay off your debts, when you work the plan, and you don't have payments, we say it on the show all the time, but the freedom that comes with that, not just the financial freedom, but also the emotional freedom, the spiritual freedom, there is so much that is unleashed when you don't owe anyone anything. And it is a powerful, powerful financial principle that goes against the grain, because a lot of people are actually saying, money's cheap, so why would you not? Why would you not borrow and leverage and use money to make money? All of that's the culture and always has been. That's nothing new. But there is something about this deeper meaning of being debt-free. If you wanna follow your broke financial friends' financial advice, you're gonna be just like your broke financial friends. I mean, that's what it comes down to. It's look at who you're listening to, and try to find some data points that are actual facts, not mathematical theory that you discussed while having one too many glasses of wine with someone. It's economic theory, but try to find someone who actually used that theory and became wealthy. You just can't find it. You can't find it. And we've got piles of data of 30 years, and millions and millions of people that have figured out that when you don't have any payments, you have control of your most powerful wealth building tool. You are much more likely, and it's much easier to build wealth when you stay out of giving everybody else your money. That's right. So we always talk about getting out of debt using the debt snowball. So simply, that's where you list out all of your debts, smallest to largest, regardless of the interest rate. Pay minimal payments on everything and start with that smallest debt first. And again, there's so much content on this channel, as we talked about on the Ramsey Show all the time, so make sure to check it out if you are new.","The discussion emphasizes the importance of paying off debts, including student loans, and becoming debt-free. Being debt-free not only brings financial freedom but also emotional and spiritual freedom. The hosts warn against following the advice of financially unsuccessful friends and suggest finding data points and real-life examples of successful wealth-building strategies. The debt snowball method is recommended as a way to pay off debts by listing them from smallest to largest and paying minimal payments on all while focusing on the smallest debt first."
210,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7ogu99lOyk_sep_684_983,J7ogu99lOyk_sep_684_983,"I did all my Black Friday shopping. I usually use Black Friday and Cyber Monday to do my Christmas shopping, because it's just a good deal. So I'm like, all right, I make my list and I do it. And every single time I checked out, it was like, you could actually only pay this, a fourth of what it was. And I'm like, oh my gosh. So it is wild though, the psychology that they use, being able to show you a number, because even where they place it, when you check out, you're like, oh, I see what you're doing after pay, I see what you're doing. And comparing your bill to that, and how it's like, oh yeah, that's so easy, that's so easy. And people are doing it. Buy now, pay later users have increased by 56% just in the last year. So people love the four payment method versus the 100% payment method. And it's, for an old guy like me and old Boomer, it's kind of humorous that people act like this is something new. You know, we were, your mom and I were moving, as you know, we sold our house and we're cleaning out a whole bunch of junk. And I found the newspaper from the early 1970s when Richard Nixon resigned. Oh wow, look at you keeping archives. Yeah, who knew? Oh my gosh. But what was very interesting was not the article on that, but was flipping through. And these ancient ads for cars, ancient ads for clothing at Castronauts, which is a store that's been gone for a thousand years, right, this kind of thing. And it's the exact same verbiage. Easy payments, quick, easy payments. Just come down, we'll take care of you. No down payment. It's the exact, they're still, it's the exact same thing. You're like, Klarna is not new. It's just got a weird name. It's just not new. And 78% of millennials who use afterpay missed a payment. And it's everywhere, you guys. And it's kind of really, it's absurd really when you look at it. If you kind of back up from it, you go, this is just very childish. I mean, like I bought a little T-shirt with a funny saying about golf on it. It was $9. And it pops up, do you want four payments on a $9 shirt? Oh my gosh, you probably don't need to buy a golf shirt. Oh my gosh, it's not. Any payments on $9, four easy payments. Oh God, it's everywhere, it's everywhere. And that just tells you the absurdity of how these, how far these companies have gone and how far they've lost their minds. Yeah, so be aware, you guys, because what ends up happening is you, they get you in to get that lower payment. And then you feel like, oh, well, I can spend more now because I can spend that, and then I'll just have to make it. And so the whole thing, it's debt, it causes you to spend more, not a good plan. So avoid afterpay. All right, number six, along those same lines, just pay attention this year to your online spending habits. Mine are not great, let's be honest. You know, things like Amazon and being able to get to things quickly, it creates an environment where I'm like, oh, it's so easy. There's no friction. So if you need something, it's like, oh, I can just get it on Amazon now, this is how I am now, and I'm good. Where if I had to wait two or three days to go to Target or Walgreens or actually go to the store to buy it, I may have forgotten about it or not even needed it three days later. But in the moment when you feel like you need something, how quickly it is. And it's fascinating because studies show that between 8 p.m. and 9 p.m. are the peak times for online purchases. After a long day, you're laying in bed and you're just buying some stuff, buying some stuff. So you have to pay attention. This is, again, this is my weak spot that I have to be really diligent on because it's the convenience for me, and then I end up spending more, and I'm like, why did I do that? Why did I do that? Again, if you pan back and get out of the daily rhythm that has become our lives, and you look at stuff like Klarna or you look at the way we purchase things now, it is kind of bizarre in the scope of history. I mean, I remember that movie that was out when you were a little kid, the Aladdin movie. Robin Williams was the genie, right? The genie would give you three wishes. You rubbed the lamp, right? And now you walk around with a genie in your hand who just gives you every wish. And it's unlimited wishes, by the way. Unlimited stupidity. You can just go on for days and buy things and buy things. It's like we've given children a magic wand and no judgment with it. And so don't be a child with a magic wand. I mean, that's the thing. I know, it is so true. I sometimes, I'm like, I'll go through something like on my phone and I'm doing something, and I will have that moment where I'm like, this is crazy. Like I bought pizza from the Papa John's app. Literally, you click the app, you click the pizza order, and then it's Apple Pay. So I just double click on my face and the pizza shows up. Like 45 minutes later, I was like, this is so... It's like a magic wand. The convenience can be great, but also can make you spin more, so it's nuts.","The discussion is about personal finance and how people's shopping behavior has changed with the rise of online shopping and the use of buy-now-pay-later schemes. The speaker mentions how these schemes are not new and have been used in the past by companies to attract customers. The speaker advises people to be aware of their online spending habits and to avoid buy-now-pay-later schemes, as they can cause people to spend more and get into debt. The discussion also mentions the convenience of online shopping and how it can lead to impulsive purchases. The speaker suggests being mindful of online spending habits and not to act like children with a magic wand."
211,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7ogu99lOyk_sep_985_1320,J7ogu99lOyk_sep_985_1320,"is fully funded. So once you are out of debt, we talk about bumping up your starter emergency fund of $1,000 that you get before you get out of debt, and then you bump that up once you're debt free to three to six months of expenses. And you want to make sure this continues to stay full, because some of you, which is great that you had the emergency fund dipped into it in this past year if something came up, but you just always wanna make sure that it's full. So if you went into your emergency fund, then make sure all of your efforts are going to refund it, because just having that safety net in life gives you such peace and such comfort just knowing, okay, I have cash in the bank. Yeah, things are more expensive, and I wanna keep spending at a level that is not sustainable, is not an emergency. Buying things that you wanna buy and just yelling at inflation and going, it's inflation's fault. No, it's your fault. You have to stay within your budget, and it's not an emergency. Now, your heating and air going out is an emergency. Your tire going flat could be an emergency, but things are now tight, so I'm using my savings to not adjust my behaviors to reflect an inflationary economy is not an emergency. That's a choice, and it's a bad one. So stay out of your emergency fund unless it's an emergency. That's right, yep. And like we talked about earlier, getting out of debt, part of that is cutting up your credit card, so don't use your credit card as an emergency fund. It needs to be cash in the bank. Oh, for God's sake. That's your emergency. All right, number eight, don't stop investing. So if you're on baby step four, which means you're out of debt, you have a fully funded emergency fund, that's when you invest 15% of your income into retirement. And a lot of people would take calls on the Ramsey Show or I feel like I do a lot where they're like, should I still be putting money in? The market is down, it's going crazy, I don't feel comfortable doing it, and a lot of people are cautious around it, and we're like, no, that's the time to do it. That's the time to do it. I was watching a video on Instagram, hold your breath, and actually her advice was great, this girl, because she was like, wealthy people, Warren Buffett said it too, when people get fearful, that's when you need to get greedy. Greedy's not a great word, but it's like, okay, I'm gonna jump in because when you invest, when it's low and you put your money in, you get more for it because it's on sale, and then as it rides up, you get to ride that wave and make more and more money in your investments, where people that say, no, I'm fearful, so I'm gonna pull out and just say, I don't wanna do anything, then they try to get in when it's going up, and then they don't make as much money. So there is this kind of that science of continue to invest. Continue to invest, up or down, because you're gonna ride all the waves for the good and the bad, but also for the good, because we believe in investing enough and the economy enough to believe that it is all gonna come back, and it's been doing this a lot, but it's powerful when you do it when it's low and people are fearful. I haven't stopped my investment. Don't stop your investing. The only one that gets hurt on a roller coaster is the one that jumps off in the middle of the ride. And I'm 62, so I'm that retirement age type of a thing. I'm not gonna retire, but you see the point. I mean, I'm in that same age bracket, and even I haven't stopped investing. In other words, I don't have as long a window to invest that money as you would. Right, right. But even in that situation, I'm still investing, because it's on sale, y'all. Rachel's exactly right. Yep, so things like your 401K, Roth IRA, all great places to invest. All right, number nine, don't sit on the sidelines if you're ready to buy a home. People have been talking about real estate a lot, and you may not know this, but one of your voiceovers, someone took a voiceover of you from, I guess, The Ramsey Show, and put it on Instagram, and it became a trending, like real, it became a trending audio clip that people then started putting everywhere on their stuff. And there was a lot of realtors that were like, yeah, this is what Dave Ramsey says, buy the house, buy the house. And if you're scared about interest rates, and they go back down, then you can refinance. Yeah, but it was trending, so you may not have known that. It was. Because I don't keep up with that stuff. I know you don't, but. You're welcome, you're welcome. The point is, though, whether it's on Instagram or not, the point is that real estate, we've seen some price adjustments because some of them were overpriced, because some of the sellers asking prices kind of still had the mentality of a white, hot, crazy post-COVID market, and that's no longer here. We've got a very calm, almost sedate market right now. It's really kind of a, everybody's like, if they buy a house, they're kind of sneaking around to do it, kind of a thing. And so it's slowed down, the volume has slowed down, and so you're still going to see these prices maintain. You're not gonna see them go down. And the supply-demand curve is there, so you're not gonna see it go away. Prices have come down, values have not come down. And so in some markets, in some markets it's just sitting there steady, and it's just not cray-cray like 83 offers and one weekend thing. All of that stuff's gone. Thank goodness it needed to go away. But this is a great time to sell a house, and it's a great time, because there's a lot of buyers. There's more buyers than there is houses. It's a great time to buy a house, and it's a great time, and it's a great time,","The discussion is about personal finance, and some tips for managing money. It is important to have an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses, which should be kept full and not used for non-emergencies. Credit cards should not be used as an emergency fund. Once out of debt, it is important to invest 15% of income into retirement, even when the market is down, as it provides an opportunity to buy low and benefit from potential future gains. People who are ready to buy a home should not sit on the sidelines, as there are opportunities to buy due to some price adjustments in the real estate market."

But listen, here's the deal. When you are married, you become one in every aspect of your life, including your money. And the couples that say, we're a team, we're doing this together, it's not yours and mine, and we played this whole game, but we are in this whole thing together, and we are working towards the same goal, we're on the same team. Those are the ones, you guys, that honestly, they financially win faster, and even greater because they end up doing more and more and more because of that connectedness that they have. And then to the marriage side, which I always think is fascinating, their marriage deepens. I mean, there's this level of intimacy that's created when you say to your partner, it's everything. Like, when we are married, what's mine is yours. Like, we are in this together, and it does something to the level of your marriage as well. And so it's huge, but we get a lot of pushback on it. We get a lot of pushback on a lot of things because the culture's lost its mind. But the truth is this, your treasure's where your heart is, it says in the Bible. So where you spend your money says what's important to you. And when you combine your spending, and you combine your investing, and you combine your financial decision-making, you are agreeing on, and it requires a lot of communication and a little bit of friction and a little bit of give and take, but we're agreeing on our values. We're agreeing on our fears. We're agreeing on our dreams. And when you just have your little thing, he has his little thing, or she, you know, back and forth, then you don't have combined dreams. And then look up later in your divorce and you wonder why. Well, you didn't have combined dreams. You didn't have a, we weren't going to the same place. You can't, it's much more efficient to get to the same place if you're both in agreement on what the same place is. It's pretty simple stuff. But it's the way that this thing works. And again, it's data-based, meaning that of the 10,167 millionaires that we interviewed, a high percentage of them, 79% said they work very, very closely with their spouse, not I became wealthy in spite of my spouse, or without my spouse's knowledge, and I just went over here and did it over here to the side, and they did their thing. We never hear that from millionaires. I mean, never. It never comes up. The number of people that stand on the stage upstairs here at Ramsey Solutions and do their debt-free scream right outside the Ramsey Show studios, and they say, you know, I brought my spouse with me to scream, but I really did it all by myself. It's precisely zero. That just does not happen. Yep, that's right. So it's something powerful, you guys, on a marriage aspect, but also a financial aspect, so work together. All right, number 11, have a bigger why for your money. So when you are getting out of debt and it's exhausting and you're tired and you're working the debt snowball, having that why continues to motivate you. When you start to build wealth and you're thinking, okay, what am I gonna do with this? How are we gonna handle this? That why is still gonna motivate you. So having a big why is gonna help you through this entire process. I think the thing to think about is, what is money good for? And that'll give you your why. Because money, just to have money is useless. It's just a tool, though. It's a tool that God gave you. You're supposed to manage it for him and for your family. Okay, so now what are we gonna do with this tool, this thing that allows me to lift, this thing that allows me to move things? What's the tool for? And then that'll start to give you your why. And you go, gosh, if I had a big pile of money, what would be the benefit of that? Well, I would have margin. I would have choices. I could help others and be generous. I could change my family tree. My kids wouldn't have to worry about going to college or anything. I mean, my relationships, I'd be a lot less stressed. So it's what money does that matters. The money itself is not important. Right, right, that's so good. All right, last but not least, have hope for your money in 2023. So listen, it's been hard. We've talked to so many of you and it's been a struggle. Some of you have faced things in the last two, two and a half years that you never thought you'd have to face. And it's all come to fruition. And so there's some of you out there that are thriving and you're doing great, you're doing the plan, you're feeling the traction and it's awesome. And there's those of you that are thinking, I don't know if I can keep going. I don't know if I can keep going. But I just wanna tell you, if you're discouraged, I want you to have hope. Hope that you can do it. And you guys, we've seen every story you can imagine from every debt level, every income level, every background of a person, everything. But one characteristic that continues to be consistent in people that we see that win is they believe they can. And that doesn't mean that life is gonna do this. It's gonna do, kinda like the stock market, goes up and down, up and down, up and down. So you're gonna have good times, you're gonna have bad times. But the belief though, that you have the ability to change your life and your money, that hope and that intentionality is the thing that separates people from actually winning and those that don't. So again, if you're having a hard time, just know, just know that this is a season and continue to press forward. I was talking to a lady I was traveling and she came up and just tears, tears, tears, tears. And she just said, I listen to you guys every day. And she was like, it's been the worst year of my life. And I just don't feel like I can keep going. But seeing you right now, this is giving me like, this is the grace from God. And she gave me a hug and we had to keep passing as I was traveling. But I'm like, there's just, it's hard, it's hard. And people are in different parts of their stories. And so if that's you that's kind of had that moment or that year where you're thinking, man, it is tough. Just know that there's people, a building here in Nashville that we work day in and day out to help you and that believe in you and support you. And that hope is something that is so crucial to have.","The discussion revolves around personal finance and relationships, particularly joint checking accounts. It is suggested that when a couple is married, they should combine their money to achieve their shared goals and values. According to a survey of millionaires, 79% of them work closely with their spouses, which shows the significance of working together for financial success. The importance of having a bigger purpose and hope in 2023 to motivate and sustain financial success is also highlighted. Money is considered a tool to achieve greater goals, such as having margin, helping others, and changing family trees."

I am going to learn more deeply about the world of finance. As I spoke to a friend of mine Nikhil Kamath of Zero Da. And I asked him that what is the big life gift of being in the world of finance? In terms of how does it benefit you as a person? And he said that you get a very clean picture of what's happening in India and the world from an economic perspective. Also you can study what's happening in people's minds. And also obviously if you learn the game there's a lot of money to be made. But from a life perspective it's this. You get to understand what's happening out there. So that's what we are going to do today sir. This is the 2022 and maybe 2023 money making plan for the audience. So keeping that in mind. What has COVID done to your world of finance? What has COVID done actually? What has happened was overdue. If you see finance it's the most basic life skill everyone should know. And COVID has pushed that need of knowing this life skill. And this was ought to happen. Because people lost their jobs therefore they figured instead of going for a job you can actually make money here. Correct. And people who lost their job they had money. So they were thinking that what do I do with this money? Right? From all angles. People who didn't have a career they were thinking that this is such a stable career. I am always there whatever happens I can still pursue this career. So everything, everything changed. From education perspective look at the way people have gone ahead and started learning about the subject. Because finance is our heartbeat. We have to know about it. Because today you may not have job tomorrow you have job. Finally your money should make more money out of it. So how do you deal with it is something which people have realized. People have gone on it basically. I want to highlight three learnings of mine from this past two year period of learning finance. One there was a massive finance boom in content. People were learning aggressively about finance in the stock market. That led me also to learn and what I figured is that making money through stocks or through knowledge about the world of finance is very disciplinary. What I mean is there is a certain set of rules and patterns. And if you follow those patterns if you figure them out over time and if you continuously follow them you will make money. It's not as risky as people think. And a lot of people don't enter the stock market out of the fear of oh I won't be able to learn the skill or I'll lose money. You know they think of it as gambling but it's not that. If someone teaches you how to bat you'll be able to bat well. That's the first learning that this is a very learnable skill if you're just slightly disciplined you're not supposed to use much creativity. Use a set of rules. The second thing I figured is actually Ankur Vareku made a video on this recently. He said that he gave a chart for financial independence by the age of 30. And I believe it was somewhere around the range of 1 crore. As if you earn 1 crore rupees with that amount of money considering all your expenses also. If you are able to save up around 1 crore you're actually set for life. You can even plan for your retirement with just that 1 crore. And he explained how in that video. Which is quite doable if not by the age of 30 by the age of 40 for a lot of the listeners for a lot of the Indian population. So that financial independence goal is in reach for a lot of young kids and they need to understand that. And the third thing I understood is that just right now people have understood the basics and they want to learn the advanced aspects of the stock market of the world of finance. Which is where you come in Mr. Vivek Bajaj. So teach us that as well. Like you don't...","The speaker, Nikhil Kamath of Zero Da, emphasizes that being in the world of finance provides a clear picture of what's happening in India and the world from an economic perspective, helps one understand what's happening in people's minds, and offers the potential to make a lot of money. The COVID-19 pandemic has heightened the need for financial knowledge, as people have lost jobs and looked for new ways to make money. The speaker highlights three key learnings from the past two years of learning finance that are making money through stocks or knowledge of finance is very disciplinary and follows certain rules and patterns, financial independence is achievable with savings of around 1 crore rupees, and people are now interested in learning advanced aspects of the stock market and finance."

215,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xN4oDechqwA_sep_390_535,xN4oDechqwA_sep_390_535,"beyond the basics of learning those disciplines, what happens to a trader in the long term? What happens to the mind? How are you supposed to keep up with the game? Because in many ways, it's like a sport. It is, it is a sport. Whenever I'm speaking to the new investor in the market, I always give an example of Mahindra Singh Dhoni. That why Dhoni is probably technically not a very superior cricketer, who would believe that helicopters would exist. But he was the one who is now known to be one of the greatest cricketers India has seen. Why? Because of his perfect combination of skill and temperament. So stock market is exactly that. So when you are entering stock market, consider that you are entering a serious sports activity and you have to do all kinds of things which a typical professional sports person will do. Let me just talk about that point number one you mentioned that we were always scared about stock market. That was because I belong to a generation where my father figure, they have always told us to stay away from stock market. And we can't blame them for that because they have seen Harshad Mehta, they have seen Gaitan Barik and people have lost a lot of money when market was not so regulated. So we were always told, even my father, he's in stock market and I'm in stock market. But my father used to tell me, don't come to stock market. Just study and just try to do something else. Which was irony. Why would my father who has made his livelihood to stock market asking his son not to come to stock market? It's like a doctor's son, doctor is saying don't come to the doctor in occupation. So that generation has seen the tough time because market was not regulated. We as well as the next generation is seeing a much better, cleaner, structured and rule-driven market. So learning makes a lot of sense now because participation is bound to go up. And it's a life skill as I said that if you want to succeed in your career, stock market is not just for investment. We have this misconception that I need to learn stock market because I need to invest. That's not the right approach. It's for your career. If you know stock market, you know various industries, you know what is happening in the new world, then you can plan your career accordingly. If you want to get into business later, knowing the stock market in detail is a great life skill that will lead to business or another profession. Yeah, it could be a job. Maybe a profession that doesn't even exist right now. And you can predict it. So, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um.","The discussion focuses on the importance of learning finance beyond the basics and treating the stock market as a serious sport. The speaker notes that while previous generations may have been fearful of the stock market due to past incidents of fraud, the market is now more regulated and structured. Learning about the stock market is not just about investing, but also a valuable life skill that can inform career planning and even lead to new professions. The speaker also emphasizes the importance of developing a combination of skill and temperament, similar to the way that Mahendra Singh Dhoni became a great cricketer."
216,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xN4oDechqwA_sep_536_885,xN4oDechqwA_sep_536_885,"You know, what can Gen Z expect? Come on, if they want to get into the stock market right now, like how you said, once regulations were introduced for your generation, that made things cleaner and more learning oriented, that come on, you learn the correct technique to bat, and then you'll be able to score hundreds. What would you say to Gen Z? What's going to change now, going forward in the stock market? See, your overall environment, if you see in the coming few years, technology is scaling up things like anything, because of that cost of lot of things is going up. Now, in a almost negligible real interest rate scenario, if you have to beat your investments or money making opportunities from the investments, where do you go? Stock market is the place where you have to explore opportunities. And the beauty of stock market is that there is opportunity in every crisis. So when Covid happened, major crisis, no one was expecting it. And after the crisis, people said that things will go bad and market will crash. But then there were lot of companies and sectors who got benefit because of the crisis. For example, financial inclusion. So, Broking firms did good, banking overall did good, DMAT account, CDSR did good. Why? Because work from home, trade from home, that became the most obvious thing, and these companies got the benefit. Or pharma sector did well, because suddenly everyone was talking about pharma, hospital sectors could be. So in every crisis, there is an opportunity. It's also parallel with the world of content. When something happens, you make content around it, you will gain numbers. And one thing I figured is there are some parallels between the world of content and the world of finance. But keeping that in mind, because we are making finance content, let's actually answer that question right now. And I have so many more questions about India, about where the country is going, etc. Again, for that Gen Z kid, who is probably 20-21 years old now, has 10,000 rupees, wants to get into the stock market. How would you go about it? I am even asking you in terms of how would you learn those first few skills? And then how would you actually apply it in the stock market at your age now? You are in your early 40s now? And I am sure you are very different from how you were at 19-20. And I am also sure you have learned from your mistakes. Yeah, of course. What are the mistakes you want to talk about? What is the strategy you want to talk about to a 21-year-old in 2021? Okay. So first thing first, we have to understand we are here in this market to make a 50-year career. So we are 21 and we will be there in the market at the age of say 70. That means we are 50 years. So we should not be in a hurry. You don't want to make quick bucks in 4-5 months. Stock market is not a video game where we aspire to make quick bucks. So take your time in understanding what is happening in the market. Secondly, because your capital base is small, don't expect fireworks. Don't expect that you will make 10 lakh in couple of months or years just for 10,000 rupees. So you have to increase that capital allocation from 10,000 to 20,000, 25,000, 40,000. As in take small risks. Try making a profit of 1,000 rupees, 1,000 rupees. Build it up to 20. Manjar 20 make profits of maybe 1,200. Build it up to 30. And then gradually keep increasing with how much money you are paying. Correct. So there will be two things. One is you make money out of the capital which you have. And at the same time you are gaining confidence. Because market really values experience and confidence. So once you are doing that, your ability to deploy more capital goes up. So if you started with 10,000 and suppose you made 2,000 out of it. 12,000 you made. 2,000 may be a very small number because now everyone has a very flamboyant lifestyle. So for us 2,000 will be like only one dinner. But you don't understand the power of this 2,000 make money to your confidence. So after a point of time, maybe after one quarter or two quarter. You may actually think of allocating more capital. So from 10,000 you then go to 20,000 further. Then 50,000 further. So that at some point of time you can actually tell your near and dear ones that why don't you give me your capital. I have learned this art of managing it well and I will manage it for you. I want to highlight a cricket example again. You see in the IPL, there are a lot of young cricketers like Yashaswi Jaiswal, Sarfaraz Khan. You know these young good batsmen. They are never allowed to open the batting. Very rarely. Yashaswi Jaiswal exception. Most of them are told to bat at number 5. And end the innings. It's okay if you get out a few times. And then the next season that same batsman who is batted at number 6 or number 7 starts batting at number 4 or 3. Bats there for a few seasons. And then eventually you decide that okay I am good enough now to open the batting. And then you become an opener. This is what we see in Rohit Sharma's career also. In the T20 World Cup in 2007 he was the number 6 batsman I believe. And then gradually his work was up the order. Because you score a few runs, you gain confidence, you go to the next level. And then once you are the opening batsman you know how cricket works. Therefore you take risks. Therefore you even try hitting Brett Lee and Glenn McGraw for sixes. So stock market from the outside seems exactly like this. That do not focus on flamboyance at the start. Because you are seeing people your age on social media making a lot of money. That's a whole different world, that's a whole different skill set. Also the other kind of psychological and life point I would like to highlight here is. Everyone has a different timeline to their storyline. So for young college kids stop comparing yourselves to people your age who are probably social media stars. They have a different timeline. But if you play well in the stock market. You might have a career at 30 when that person won't. And your career might go on till 70 when that person would have long been gone. So perceive your own game like that and to do that work on your temperament a lot more. Then just flamboyance at the start. Correct, absolutely.","The discussion is about finance and investing for Gen Z. The speakers agree that the stock market is a good place to explore investment opportunities, especially in a scenario of low real interest rates. They emphasize the importance of taking time to learn and gain experience in the market, rather than expecting quick profits. The speakers suggest starting with a small capital base and gradually increasing it through small profits, which will help build confidence and gain experience. They highlight the parallel between content creation and finance, where crises can present opportunities for investment. The speakers advise that a long-term perspective is important in investing and that young investors should focus on building a career in the market."
217,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xN4oDechqwA_sep_886_1050,xN4oDechqwA_sep_886_1050,"with those 10,000 rupees, what would you say? Do you spend some money on a course? Do you go to a mentor? Do you... Like what would you do if you had 10,000 rupees in your hand? See, there are lot of content, good content creators who are giving their best content online these days. I mean, I also record lot of content in my YouTube channel. So, technically with 10,000, there is no point in going to a mentor or a course to start off with. It's good to go through all the free content, where I find out the right source of free content and go through it and start deploying this 10,000 rupees, not in one go. The market is the biggest mentor. Until as you swim, you will not learn so well. I can teach you from behind the door. But so, best way to start is deploy in say, in a mutual fund, start with it. 500 rupees in a mutual fund. You will feel good about that process of deploying that 500 rupees. And then look at that mutual fund where you have invested. Look at the stocks where the mutual fund has invested. All the information is available in multiple public products these days. And when you look at those stocks, you start questioning yourself that, oh, what is this company into? Is this company into X industry, Y industry? So, imagine a mutual fund where you have invested 500 rupees only. And they have invested in 50 stocks. With 500 rupees, you get an opportunity to know about 50 stocks. You should have a curiosity that, oh, I should know about this 50 stocks. What are they into? And then after that curiosity, you gain confidence, oh, this looks interesting. Let me try with another 500. Let me try with another. Because the beauty of stock market or mutual fund is that, this 500 rupees will not vanish. Because mutual fund, you will not see a major drawdown in couple of days. So, you can keep on allocating 500, 500, 500. And you make a portfolio of say, 5000 rupees to start with. And you have an understanding of 50 stock. Once you develop that confidence that, yes, I do understand. Then you start getting into allocating more capital. I'm assuming that a lot of the listeners know these terms by this point. But if someone doesn't understand the term mutual fund, it means basically a company which manages your money for you basically. Where there are experienced stock traders in a company. So, that 500 rupees will be divided into a bunch of companies. And even if some of those companies lose or if some of those companies win, it's very likely that overall on an average you will win. Because of the averaging out of all those 50 companies that the mutual fund invests in. But now we will carry on with the more advanced stuff.","The discussion is about what to do with 10,000 rupees in terms of finance. The speaker suggests not spending money on a course or mentor, but instead finding free content online to learn about investing. They recommend starting with investing 500 rupees in a mutual fund and using that as a starting point to learn about stocks and gain confidence in investing. The speaker explains that a mutual fund is a company that manages your money and invests it in a variety of stocks, which helps to spread out the risk. By starting with small amounts and building confidence, one can gradually allocate more capital and create a portfolio."
218,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xN4oDechqwA_sep_1050_1259,xN4oDechqwA_sep_1050_1259,"I just like three levels of investing, just want to add that. The first is the kind of investing you spoke about. Where you invest with mutual funds, where you're guaranteed some amount of money. The second is later on in life you go to a portfolio management service and they invest your money for you. But again the minimums they are like I think 10 lakhs? PMS is 50 lakhs. 50 lakhs. Okay, I think it used to be lesser. It used to be 25 lakhs. Yeah, it used to be 25, now it's like become 50 lakhs. So and then you know once you make that kind of money in life and if you don't want to manage money yourself, PMS I feel is the way to go. At least I've been advised so. Yeah. The third way of long term investments is your blue chip stocks. Yeah. As in stocks where you know that okay this company is definitely going to grow. Great example of that is Tesla with what's happening internationally. Yeah. Great example of that is Reliance because of the track record of Reliance and everything that they're trying to do. Yeah. Tata. Like which Tata? Take any Tata stock yaar, they have done so well in last one year. Yeah, so these stocks you know that if you park your money there it will grow with time. One thing I've learned is that the second way of looking at investing money is daily trading where you're supposed to look at the green waves. Yeah. In terms of you have a chance to make more money by trading regularly than by just holding on to stocks in the long term. If you understand how markets work and this is the skill we're trying to highlight. Correct. How do you crack that skill of daily trading? Correct. So one thing I've understood is you ride the green waves. Yeah. Am I right in saying that? Yeah. When something's going up, you let it go up for some time and then once you really see it going up and you feel like yes I can take a bet on it you bet on that riding that green wave. Yeah. And similarly with the red waves you don't immediately drop it off. But after it's been dropping for a while then you drop it off. Yeah. You pull your money out of that. Yeah. And eventually the skill of the stock market is that you can sort of almost do a little bit of pattern recognition. Because you've done it for that long. Yeah. Please correct me if I'm wrong sir. No, no. You are actually quite surprised. Your explanation is absolutely bang on. When you are trading the market for you, you don't care which company you are trading. It's the price we have or it's the stock price which you are trading. So it could be Tesla you are trading or could be Reliance or any company you are trading. Which is the price you are trading and price is the reflection of the law of demand. Which is if there are more buyers price will go up. If there are more sellers price will go down. Which is why you need to understand the stock market from behind the scenes. Yeah. In terms of you are seeing names, numbers of companies. But if you also read the news, if you also understand other industries, if you have friends in other industries who tell you that hmm this company is making a great product and it's likely that their stock price is going to go up. Yeah. I'm guessing that's the next layer. That's the so let's divide this into investing in trading. So what you are saying is more valid for investing because you are investing in the product of the company or the business of the company. But when you are trading it doesn't matter that what the company is making or what announcement company is going to make because the price which is already behaving in a certain manner is a reflection of the performance of the company. So these are two different things. Okay. Either you are investing where looking at the business or you are trading where you're looking at the price. Okay. Can you highlight that trading where you are looking at the price a little more in terms of what does that really mean? Yeah. Yeah.","The discussion covers three levels of long-term investments: investing with mutual funds, investing through a portfolio management service (PMS) for those with a minimum of 50 lakhs, and investing in blue chip stocks of reliable companies. The conversation also mentions daily trading, where the goal is to make more money by trading regularly rather than holding onto stocks long-term. The strategy for daily trading is to observe the green and red waves of the stock market and engage in pattern recognition to determine when to buy or sell. The discussion differentiates between investing, where you look at the business or product of a company, and trading, where you focus on the stock price. When trading, it doesn't matter what the company is making or what announcements it makes because the stock price is a reflection of the company's performance."

Based on what the company has done in the recent past? No, no. Then? I mean, let's... It's mathematical? Yeah, it's mathematics. Okay. Could be because of that. But when someone is trading, the person is not trying to relate the price behaviour with actions which are done by the company. It's very mathematical, methodical. Yeah. Like you are just seeing the numbers. Just seeing the numbers. Video games. So, you are not trying to relate price that today price went up because this happened. No. Always assumption is that price has all these information embedded because someone who is better in the market, better than me, has already acted on the price and price is a reflection of that action. Your role is to figure out that what will happen to the price next. So, it's more maths. It has nothing to do with the company. And how do you figure it out? There is a science. There is a science which is derived out of law of demand and supply that if we know that there are more buyers in the stock right now at this moment, then the chances that price will go up is high. So, you also become the buyer. Now how do you know whether there are more buyers or sellers? There is a science which is called technical analysis. This is why they say don't apply creativity in the stock market. Follow the set rules. If you reach that point when you are able to define the rule and you follow it, that's like the ultimate stage of your, you know, it's like a Nirvana moment that yes, I have been able to crack that code. Is that why people look up to Nikhil Kamath and Rakesh Junjunwala that much because those guys have reached some certain mental stage where... Absolutely. Could you describe that a little more? What makes these two...","The discussion is about the nature of the stock market and how it is perceived by traders. The price of a stock is seen as a reflection of all available information, and traders use technical analysis to determine whether to buy or sell. Technical analysis is a science derived from the law of supply and demand and involves following set rules rather than applying creativity. Successful traders who have mastered this science are highly respected, such as Nikhil Kamath and Rakesh Junjunwala. The discussion suggests that the stock market is primarily mathematical and methodical and has little to do with the actions of the company behind the stock."
220,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xN4oDechqwA_sep_1500_1873,xN4oDechqwA_sep_1500_1873,"You said that you need a basic level of skills, the science of the stock market which is very mathematical, very methodical, someone needs to just tell you that these are the things you always have to follow for the rest of your life. Then you need temperament, which is why you brought up Dhoni and you said that maybe he's not the most talented cricketer ever, but his combination of temperament and skills is what has taken him to the top. Also, there's one more thing I would like to add to Dhoni's skill set which I see is common with what you say about Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, which is observational ability, observing other people. Have you seen all those videos of Dhoni magic moments behind the stumps where he indicates something to his bowlers? He says that no, do this. He's actually built many bowlers' careers, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohit Sharma, the late part of Harbhajan Singh's career, Ashwin, because he's worked with them in order to get them more wickets. That's why Dhoni is also such a respected captain. That basically boils down to studying your opponent, studying body language, studying the situation, observing very calmly. The less calm that's in your head, the less the observational ability also. The more calm, the more the observational ability. You never see Dhoni reacting on the field. He just acts. He responds to situations. And stock market is such a place which will always give you uneasy situations. The real differentiation comes, how do you react when a situation is bad? The market went down by say 4% today. How many people will be calm, composed, smiling? Very few. And most of the time, people who lose money, they will get disturbed mentally, they will react, they will show all kinds of body language, which is not... And market doesn't like those kinds of body languages. See, for us, when I was young, when I belonged to that generation of Nickel Commerce of the world, I have seen my father talking to market, when it was online market. So my father talking to market, my brother, who's a trader, he's been trading since the age of 16 and he's right now 48. These guys talk to market, in the screen, they look at screen and say to the market that, why did you make me wrong today? Oh wow, what a lovely trade I did, pat in the back. So they're talking to market. So for me, market is also an entity. It's a personality. And if your personality matches well with that personality, then you are here for a long wealth creation. I always see like I am not built for stock trading because I'm not a number-oriented person. And that's why I don't want to learn the batting also. And it's fine, like my money is coming from other places. But I do believe that in terms of temperament, it's basically what you said, right? Like it's you stay calm. Is that what you mean by personality fit? And the reason I ask you this is to help the listeners understand whether or not they are built for the market. So could you list out what you need? I'm guessing you need to love numbers, you need to love data, you need to love studying different industries. Correct. But in terms of temperament, what do you need? And can you build up those things when it comes to temperament? So how do you build temperament? So most of the time, things which are unknown in our life, we are always worried about those things. The moment we get the knowledge of that thing, we become very comfortable with it. Temperament also is something which for each occupation, if a chartered accountant will have a different temperament, an ITN will have a different, depending upon the occupation that person has. So you need to spend some time in the market to realise what kind of temperament you have and what aspect of the market fits you well. So your temperament cannot be measured. There is no tool which says that this is what you are and this much risk you can take or this much, you know, you will have so much of nervousness if you lose this much money. So it takes some time to be there in the market and it comes naturally that, okay, I am meant to do this and I will do only this in the market. But the problem is people don't conclude that. They are fighting with the market all the time. How can this happen? Why is this not happening with me? Maybe you are not made for that and that will happen over a period of time. And I will also say that people should also be open to the idea of quitting the market. Maybe it's not meant for you. Why are you fighting? Maybe your neighbour was born to make his career in this market. Why are you worried that he made a lot of money and you are not able to make money? So temperament, I can't give a mathematical equation that this is exactly what is needed because it also depends upon your risk appetite, your background, how much money do you have to lose? Because in market, we always say that if you save losing money, you will make money. The problem in market is people lose money and get out. The moment you restrict that losses in the market, automatically you will make money because the character of market is that it will give you money. You know when they say this is ruined because of the stock market. When you talk about someone who lost all their wealth in the stock market, I think it's an outcome of situations like this. They are forcing yourself to be there. There is a story where someone at once asked the Buddha, Hey Buddha, I want happiness. And the Buddha responded by saying, okay, if you want happiness, remember this. You said, I want happiness. Remove the I, you are removing the ego. Remove the want, you are removing desire. And you are left with happiness. And I would apply the same rule to I want money. In the stock market. You say, I want money, remove the I, you are removing the ego. Learn all the skills, be very humble about it. And remove the want, therefore you are removing that inner urge and you are working on your temperament by removing the want. You are being a little detached almost from it. You are approaching it mechanically. Correct. Would you agree? Yes, absolutely. I think it's a universal truth which works in everything. And market is not very different. We just have to. But also in saying that I don't want to discourage young investors from investing in the stock market, at least as long term investors. See, we are talking about trading. Whatever interaction we had, trading is a very different ball game. Investing is like you have to do it. Yeah. It's no choice. What is equity investment for?","The discussion talks about the qualities required for success in the stock market. The speaker mentions that a basic level of skills is needed, along with temperament, which involves being calm, observing your opponent, and studying the situation. The speaker uses the example of cricketer MS Dhoni's success, which comes from his combination of skills, temperament, and observational ability. They note that temperament is different for each occupation and that it takes some time to realize what kind of temperament fits the market well. The speaker suggests that people should also be open to the idea of quitting the market if it's not meant for them. Additionally, the speaker points out that in the market, if you save losing money, you will make money, as the character of the market is to give you money."
221,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xN4oDechqwA_sep_1874_2039,xN4oDechqwA_sep_1874_2039,"just beginning in this world. Okay, so equity investment is when you are investing in any company believing that the company will grow in future. You become owner of that company by buying one share of that company. So if you believe that Reliance is doing incredible work. This is where you have to focus on the product of the business. Of course, because product drives the growth and making a presumptions about the future potential of the product is the art which will differentiate me with Rakesh Janjoonwala because he can make a much better prediction about Titan or Tata Motor than I because I am not well read. I probably have not so much of exposure. He has many people around him who is giving him constant feed. So are you part of a good network? Are you part of that, you know, that classic circle of good influence, which is giving you right feeds in your mind so that you are channelizing that knowledge for the right stock identification? Yeah, for sure. What people don't understand is they talk about high risk, high investments. I just want to paint a real picture what's happening in the content creation world right now. So there's content creators who are earning money. Everyone's earning money in this industry. There's a lot of them who are spending money on cars and clothes and all these things. And then there's a few content creators who have kept a significant portion of the earnings on the side, say about a crore of rupees. Divide that into five lakh or ten lakh packets. So that gives you what? Twenty five lakh packets. They are investing five lakhs in twenty startups. Now even if one of those startups takes off, you have probably made five crores at least from that one crore investment. You're doing your own kind of mini mutual fund and this is happening right now. Even when we talk about startup investments, a lot of young people visualize, oh, he's investing crores. It's not crores. It's about five, six lakhs. Usually there are people who choose to invest ten, fifteen lakhs if they really believe in a startup. And then definitely there are companies where they require a minimum of like one, two crores. But mostly it's in this five, six lakh range. You can begin your startup investment here. And what you're talking about equity investing is basically a version of what people refer to as startup investing right now. If you believe in the product that this group of people is building, then it's likely that your investment in that product will benefit you in the long term. What if you don't have five lakhs to invest? Because startups will not entertain ten thousand rupees from you, right? But you still want to invest in startup. What do you do that? Then you need to identify a company which is listed.","The discussion is about equity investment, which is investing in a company with the belief that it will grow in the future. The focus should be on the product of the business, and making assumptions about the future potential of the product is essential. Having a good network and being part of the right circle of influence can help in making better predictions about the stock. Content creators are also investing in startups with smaller amounts of money, and even investing five lakhs in twenty startups can lead to significant returns. Startup investing usually requires a minimum investment of five to six lakhs, but there are listed companies that can be invested in with smaller amounts of money."

Case in point is Nokri.com. Nokri.com is a listed company which incubated multiple ventures including Zomato. See the valuation which Nokri has created in fact we all know the story of Nokri.com. So by buying one share of Nokri literally you have taken exposure in all the startups where Nokri has invested. We all don't know the story of Nokri.com. Oh so Nokri.com we know Nokri right it's a very important part of India's growth story the best place to source the talent and Nokri founder was very proactive and he started investing in startups from the earning which Nokri was doing right. The name of the company is InfoH the parent company which is listed in the market. So Nokri used to make a lot of money and the founder was deploying that startup exactly what you said. So they incubated companies like Zomato right and you know what has happened in Zomato it has created tremendous wealth for all the shareholders. So Nokri made a lot of money and that money is where inside that company. So if you own one share of that company indirectly you have also made money. This is going to happen in the content creation world by the way like and this is parallel with the conversation about web 3 we were having. But the internet is changing now. We had an episode that will actually be out very soon after this.,"The discussion is about investing in equity and startup companies. One way to invest in startups indirectly is by buying shares of a listed company that incubates multiple ventures. The example given is Nokri.com, which incubated Zomato and created significant wealth for its shareholders. By buying one share of Nokri, investors can indirectly invest in all the startups where Nokri has invested. This strategy is similar to what content creators are doing in the content creation world, and it is parallel to the conversation about web 3."
223,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xN4oDechqwA_sep_2130_2615,xN4oDechqwA_sep_2130_2615,"which is centered around the world of Web 3, crypto, blockchain. So basically tech nowadays, like when we refer to software, any tech product is built using a certain coding language, is built using a certain kind of raw material. Okay. Now imagine the future will use different kinds of raw material, different kind of coding languages. And it will be able to build a different form of technology, different form of software. That's what people refer to as blockchain based technology. Yeah. And that whole ecosystem which will be developed will be called Web 3. Now there is a lot of opportunity firstly for growth in Web 3. Web 3 is going to be a whole other world. People refer to Web 3 in many ways as metaverse. We're seeing with Mark Zuckerberg creating meta, etc. Sorry, rebranding Facebook as meta. Metaverse is a part of Web 3, a big part of Web 3. But people don't understand about Web 3. And this is something a Web 3 expert told me yesterday. He said that often you think that there are maybe five or six trillion dollar companies in the world right now. You'll name Facebook, you'll name Google, you'll name Amazon, Tesla, whatever. But Web 3 is going to open up the floodgates for opportunity to create 100 times that many number of trillion dollar companies. And he explained why he said that there's going to be more transactions in the metaverse, human behavior is going to change in more ways than you can imagine. Technology is advancing. For example, a very basic kind of explanation of this is when phones started becoming more advanced and they started building cameras inside phones. It kind of shut down the market for traditional digital camera companies. Case in point Kodak, which was like the top company. Case in point even I would say Blackberry. Couldn't keep up with all the other phones getting better. Now imagine such a huge technological revolution is coming that human behavior industries all over the world are going to be shut down. That's going to create so many new opportunities. There's a lot of money to be made. And the beautiful thing is that right now, often you'll see a lot of content creators also complaining about the algorithm. The algorithm doesn't support me or the algorithm did this to me. Web 3 is not going to be controlled by algorithms. You will be on a level playing field with Facebook and Google. It sounds crazy and watch out for that podcast when it comes out as well. I'm sure, sir, even the world of finance right now is fascinated by Web 3. It is. Everything is linked. And if you say that I feel so disgusted when people say that I don't want to know the stock market because I have nothing to do with it. And I say that what are you saying? It is such an important part of our lifestyle, our future. So what you said that you met someone who told you about these things. People who are there in the stock market, they have this quest of finding out what's happening in the world. Because they need to find opportunities. Can I list out some things which I figured from the podcast? I feel podcasting is in the right zone. I want to highlight two things. That startup thing I told you about investing a crore across startups. You might have the money. What you may not have is the opportunity which will come your way. In terms of where will 20 correct startups approach you from? So you also need to be out there. And content creation podcasting has put, fortunately, my people and myself at that forefront of, we attract the right opportunities because we are out there so much. I've also got the right advice from a lot of people at the top. And I can name a few industries which are likely to grow. One is lifestyle, like for sure because people are being more health conscious. Sustainability is not 100% there but it's catching up a lot. Environmental friendly products especially in the clothing industry. Because people don't know that the clothes you wear fast fashion actually causes a lot of pollution. And Gen Z, Gen N is waking up to these things. The third big one is blockchain based tech. That's what's really going to disrupt everything. And this we had an American VC, an Indian American VC, Kavita Gupta on the show. She is very bullish on blockchain based technologies and so is Silicon Valley. People talk about AI and biohacking as the big changes in the future. Blockchain based technologies are very close to us. It's going to happen over the next three, four years. We are already seeing it with this hype about cryptocurrencies but that's literally the building blocks of the world of Web3. There's so much more that's going to come our way. Like even in the world of finance, the world of finance is very wide. There's the stock market, there's banks, there's the equity market. A lot of that is going to get chapod for lack of a better word in the Web3 world. In terms of there's going to be a Web3 version of that. And create so many more opportunities for different kind of businesses that are built using blockchain technology. Right. That's what I wanted to highlight. That just keep an eye out for blockchain based tech. Yeah. Someone at once told me that if you want to become a billionaire really fast, you build a tech product. What they meant is you attach software with your business. So say you're selling fruit. If somehow you figure, okay, how can I attach software with this process of selling fruit? Are you collecting data about the fruit? Are you selling fruit through an app? Are you making a life of a farmer easier through software? Your valuation of your business goes up. If you own that equity in that particular software based business, the amount of wealth you own also goes up. Therefore, people are like, try bringing software into your business, try creating things with software. That is still true and that's going to be true for the next 10, 20, 30 years. But also this whole aspect of blockchain. Understand how blockchain works and this podcast is not about blockchain. This is an insight into making money. Money will be made when you understand blockchain in detail, when you stay updated with what's happening in the world of blockchain. And when you stay updated with all the updates of Web3. And we've seen a massive update of Web3 with Mark Zuckerberg talking about Meta. He's currently at the forefront of culture. And if one of the biggest companies in the world is talking about Web3 and Meta, it's going to affect how the rest of the tech world also thinks about it. True that. Anyway, sir, go on. So let me just, you know, because obviously these things are very difficult for the last mile finance enthusiast to learn, because these are like, because you interviewed someone and you got so much of knowledge and you need to read a lot to reach to that level of knowledge which we have gained. Let me just give you a synopsis of how this investment cycle works. So when an entrepreneur starts the journey of entrepreneurship, the entrepreneur puts his own pocket money and friends and family and starts the business. Then the next stage comes where VC puts in money in the entrepreneur's business because they have seen the proof of concept. Can you invest at that stage as a VC with small capital? Probably not, because 10,000, 50,000, 1 lakh is not a very big capital to invest at a VC stage. But yes, you can participate. If you have seen any company which is doing it and you are buying share of that company, I give you an example of Naqli.com. So from that VC, when it goes to private equity, which is they put a larger capital and they take higher stake in the company. Private equity is like big, big capital given to that company. When does a company take a call of entering the private equity market? So first stage is when product prototype is ready, so it goes to VC. And the second stage is when some revenue has already been showcased and the company is now looking to expand geographically. Geographically? So say I am a regional Bombay based fruit seller. And a VC has given you 1 crore to grow your business in Bombay. You have shown that you have had success in Bombay and now you want to say I want to go to India. Correct. So there we need private equity funding because we are talking about revenue from say 1 crore to 100 crore. So 100 crore revenue will need lot of capital to burn for your marketing, for team etc. So from private equity, it probably stays in the company for long.","The discussion centers around the world of Web 3, crypto, and blockchain. Web 3 is going to be a whole new world, opening up the floodgates for opportunities to create 100 times more trillion-dollar companies than there are today.

Web 3 will create so many new opportunities that traditional industries will be shut down. The finance industry is fascinated by Web 3, and blockchain-based tech is going to disrupt everything, causing changes in the world of finance. There is a lot of money to be made in this new ecosystem, and blockchain-based tech is a significant opportunity to watch out for."

So there we need then private equity funding because we are talking about revenue from say one crore to 100 crore. So 100 crore revenue will need a lot of capital to burn for your marketing, for team, etc. So from private equity, it probably stays in the company for a long time, maybe for four or five years. And finally the company aspires to become an IPO company like we had recently in ICAs of the world, which has come out with an IPO and they have created wealth for all the investors who came into their ecosystem over a period of time. Now, right now what is happening for a retail investor who wants to invest 20,000 rupees, the person can only invest in NICA when the NICA has decided to come out with an IPO. But by the time you're investing, the valuation has already gone up. So you are coming into the market at the, I would not say the last stage, but at the higher value of this whole, higher value of that value chain. So for an individual investor with a 10,000 rupees, obviously you can't make huge money because you come at the last stage of the value chain, right? But if NICA grows from here further or any listed company grows further from here, then obviously you keep on growing with their growth. But your growth will not be obnoxiously high because you have taken less risk. The guy who initially gave first money to NICA was obviously taking maximum risk. So as an investor, investing in startups or becoming part of that early stage investing journey now in 10 years will give you far better IRR or return on capital than investing in only the listed space because you talked about startup and this whole new thing. That's why I thought that it's important for stock market investors also to know this side of the game. That all this is also happening in the world. Yeah. So most of the time big money is made when you are investing in unlisted shares and unlisted shares are also available, but these are not a liquid market. Listed one, which is like regulated by the SEBI and exchange NSC is there. So there obviously your risk of operations is lesser, but by the time they come and get listed, the valuation is done. Last point. Sure. Very important. So how do we make big money from listed shares? Because if the valuation has already gone to that level, you are in the last leg of the value chain. How do you make big money? Big money has been made when market goes down, crashes because of some reason. 2000 market in the year 2000 market fell because of dot-com crash.","The discussion talks about the investment cycle in entrepreneurship, starting from the entrepreneur putting in their own money and friends and family investing, then followed by VC and private equity firms investing in the company at different stages of growth. Private equity firms usually invest in a company when they have shown revenue and are looking to expand geographically. The company then stays with private equity for a long time and aspires to become an IPO company. The discussion highlights that investing in startups or becoming part of the early stage investing journey can give better returns in the long run compared to only investing in the listed space. Lastly, big money can be made from listed shares when the market crashes due to some reason."
225,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xN4oDechqwA_sep_2757_2889,xN4oDechqwA_sep_2757_2889,"market crash because of the housing bubble in US. COVID market crash because of uncertain event which happened. That is a time when you go all in, put your money in good businesses and you make big money because those businesses were valued here during the IPO, then they start becoming available at a lower price and then you enter. So I have done this empirical study that in your lifetime you will get four opportunities. And COVID was one of them. Yeah, to make big money from stock market for opportunities. Has the COVID opportunity gone completely? Obviously, market has really outperformed. Now what you will make money is the final leg of making money. You will not make three times, four times of your capital but you will make 15, 20, 30 percent of your capital depending upon the business you select. So I got 2008 in my career where I was able to make some decent money for myself. I got 2020 in my career. I have two more left. So I need to prepare myself for those two lovely years when everyone will be in despair and distress that oh market is going down and I should be happy that market is going down. So now I can deploy my capital fully into the market. It's a contrary thought process and big money is only made if you have a contrary thought process. If you follow the herd then you are going to a slaughterhouse. Crazy. Which is why you need to play that Dhoni game and just play a stable game until the World Cup where you go crazy. Absolutely. And the final of the World Cup you make the team win. Yes because that is the day when you will make the difference. If you trade whole day, if you just be there in the market all the time because your neighbor wants you to be there, that's not a good strategy. That's a good way to remain busy. That's a good way to talk, showcase your so-called expertise of market because it's a great way to showcase your flamboyancy that oh I know about the market. This is the in thing. But do you really make money out of it by just looking at the market all the time? Not sure. Want to highlight the bento.","The discussion mentions two market crashes: the first was caused by the housing bubble in the US, and the second was caused by the uncertain event of COVID. The speaker believes that market crashes present opportunities for investors to make big money by investing in good businesses at a lower price. They suggest that there are four opportunities like this in a lifetime, and that the COVID crash was one of them. The speaker advises investors to have a contrary thought process and not follow the herd, and to play a stable game until the right opportunity presents itself, likening it to playing cricket like MS Dhoni. The speaker also mentions the concept of a bento, which is a framework for managing money that prioritizes long-term goals and values over short-term desires."

What I heard one of my nerdy finance friends say is that some of these stocks are actually not profitable. Yeah, so these businesses are not profitable at all. And in fact, there are some of the IPOs where the company itself is saying that we may not turn profitable. You remember Uber's IPO in US, where in their IPO document submitted to the regulator, they said that we don't know when we'll be profitable. So that's the new way of doing business. And people question that, fair enough. People can question it because traditionally, we have been taught that to become valuable, you need to generate profit. But the new way of doing business, maybe... Is users. Is probably you need users and the valuation is not reflection of the earning. Valuation is reflection of the future potential earning. Yeah. I'll give you an example that says Zomato, which is a loss-making, and today we say that it should not be valued. But maybe some US company who wants to come into India and do exactly what Zomato is doing, but they are 100 times bigger in US and they want to be present globally everywhere, they may perceive value in Zomato at that valuation because they know that it's far easier for me to come into India by buying steak in Zomato than going solo. So their perception of value is different. My perception of value is different because I have not seen this valuation in my life, so I will always question something which I have not seen earlier in my life. So do not question. My always suggestion to everyone is, do not question market. Do not question market that what you are giving wrong value or you are giving right value. Like, how is it? How is it? There is something, no, at every price, so reliance is say currently trading at around 2500 per share. If you go to exchange website, you see that price. At 2500, there is a buyer and there is a seller also. Think about it. What a lovely price this is. 2500, someone believes that the price should go up and the same price, someone believes that the price will go down. So how can a buyer question the seller? You take care of your perception. If you believe it will go up, if you believe it will go down, sell. But do not question what other people believe. That's what the numbers never lie. Numbers never lie. Often, I feel like the word overrated doesn't apply to anything in this world. Because what is the concept of overrated? You're seeing someone or something which is considered successful, Titanic, the movie. Lots of people love it. Some people say, oh, it's overrated. Lots of people love Bahubali. Some people say it's overrated. But it got success. It got numbers. It got a fan following. It proved its worth through real world success. You can't argue with it. And people should just take this overrated word out of their dictionary. Because numbers never lie, people never lie. People's behaviors never lie. Keeping that in mind, I also want to highlight that early on the podcast when we spoke about tech businesses being the big money opportunities for entrepreneurs, it is this. It's a valuation game. Most tech businesses are encouraged to focus much more on gaining and retaining users. So you build out a tech product. You build out a software. And if you're able to show that, oh, these users are actually using my app, my platform for so much time, it's okay if I'm not making profits. Because I've captured these users. And over time, if I'm able to capture them long enough, I can actually affect their habits, their thoughts. I get their data, which is what's happening in web too, which is what the social dilemma is about. And we're seeing that live. All these big companies we use, be it Google, Facebook, Amazon, we've used them for so long now. And they've added so much value to our lives, honestly, that they have our data. And they have changed our behavior. Like today, if you and me don't understand a particular topic, we pull out our phones and search for it on Google. If you and me meet someone at a party who's interested and you wanna stay friends, we'll go on Instagram and search for their profiles. It's changed our habits. And this is what tech valuations are based on. Can you capture a group of people? And can you make them think about your product? Can you make them use it? Can you change those people through your product? Because the ability to change human habit is highly valued. Eventually, you can turn that into profits. That's the theory. Like Uber, not profitable. But the long-term vision is that they will get every human being in the world to start ordering cabs through their phones and eventually become profitable. Maybe because by that point, you're so addicted to Uber and Ola that Uber and Ola will dictate the price of every cab. And they'll make that extra 10 rupees as compared to what they would make early on. So that's the game for people who don't understand why tech companies are valued so highly. And speaking about tech companies.","The discussion revolves around the new way of doing business, where profitability is not a necessary criterion for valuation. Instead, the focus is on gaining and retaining users, which can eventually translate into profits. This is the theory behind the high valuations of some tech companies like Uber and Zomato, which are currently not profitable but have the potential to capture a large user base and change their habits. The ability to change human habits is highly valued, and tech companies are encouraged to focus on this aspect. The discussion also emphasizes that the market determines the value of a company, and it is not wise to question it."

You've learned about careers from the stock market and you're applying it now in tech. You have some tech based businesses. So I want you to take us through that journey also super quickly. What was that story? You learned about the stock market. You saw some opportunity and you put two and two together and said, okay, this makes sense. So every time you ask any entrepreneur this question, entrepreneur will say that I developed first this product for my need. For me, when I was, when I am active, still very active, but when I was very, very active in market, I used to use a platform called Bloomberg, which was created by Michael Bloomberg and I loved the platform. And I read a book about him called Bloomberg by Bloomberg, which is phenomenal book, a 39 year old living his, you know, Solomon partnership and then starting something on his own, his inspiring book. So I thought that Bloomberg is such an important tool because it gives access of information data to an investor. But in retail retail environment, there were not many platforms who were giving that access. The market is all about information arbitrage that if I have more information, I'll make more money. If you have less information, the chances that you will not make money is high. So what I did was to empower myself. I started working on stockage in 2015. It was for me that I need data. I know Bloomberg is expensive. I can't keep on subscribing to Bloomberg for me and my team. So I created stockage. And once you create a product which is satisfying your need, automatically that product becomes viral because it's a genuine need which is getting satisfied and other people start relating themselves with you. And that's the core idea of creating tech products, create something for yourself. Create something for yourself. So what does it do? What does the company do? So stock market is a place, as you said, it's full of data. And you need a simple framework to analyze the data. So stockage was able to create that unified, a simple database, which people who wanted to know about the data, capture the data, use that data to participate in the market, they started using it. So it's a database of stocks. So stock, financial data, market price and all kinds of. Plus it also helps people to learn about markets. So they are learning at every stage of the database. So what used to happen in other products is that they always presume that people know what they want to see. Whereas we presume that 99 people don't know what is it all about. So can we explain people? So while they are consuming the data, we also explain them this is the concept. This is the concept. Now that you have learned the concept, why don't you practice this data as per the concept you have learned? So it's like a hand holding to a new investor who wants to learn stock market. In cricket terms, you're the data guy of the IPL team plus the coach who is going and telling Ishaan Kishan or Aardik Pandya to bat like this. Correct. And showing him that data in a graphical format so that his mind can comprehend what I'm trying to say. With our minds, we don't like raw data. We like graphs. And stories. And directions. CTA. Do this, do this, do this. Yeah. Correct.","The discussion is about an entrepreneur who learned about finance and life from the stock market, and how he applied that knowledge to create a tech-based business called Stockage. The entrepreneur was inspired by the Bloomberg platform, which he found expensive, and created Stockage to satisfy his own need for financial data. Stockage provides a simple framework to analyze stock market data and helps people learn about the markets. It also offers hand-holding to new investors through explanations of concepts and graphical representations of data. In summary, Stockage is a database of stocks and financial data that helps people learn about and participate in the stock market."

For someone who's learned the basics of stock market. What should be looking out for right now? It's a side. Money making opportunity Big money making opportunity is in 2020 was the time when You would have gone all in and made a lot of money. Having said that there will be opportunities To make money in the market. If you are investing, you can't look at one year. Right. So you can't say 2022 me kya hoga. Because when you are investing, it's a perpetual Investment which you are making. So India coming 50 years is a great story because what we are no one is there in this world. And the world has suddenly realized that Oh my God, we are under invested in India. So let's put more money in India because of our population, because of China plus one thing where Everyone wants to make an alternative to China also. And India is emerging as one of the alternative. So from an investing perspective, Constant identification of businesses Which we understand and we are confident about the businesses That is required. And you keep on investing as a systematic Investment plan, plan it out. 50,000, 50,000, 50,000, 50,000 So that you get the benefit of the market falls. You get the benefit of averaging for your costing. And if you are trading, I think market is going to be very Volatile. Typically, it happens when market goes up like this. It becomes volatile for some time and then it goes into Consolidation phase, which is like a flat. Nothing happens. So till next, I am expecting 2022 Will be very volatile. So be prepared for some active trading in the market. Which is why we need to highlight the concept of temperament. Yeah. Like deal with it. Be calm. Yeah, be calm. That is the most important. People run after strategies. Please tell me what works in the market. And I tell people that what works in the market is you. I think what I like about people in the world of finance Is that most of them think like, okay, let's make money and get out. Which is beautiful. It's a very functional way of looking at life. Those are the people who make it as long term Stock traders or long term daily traders. If you've got a good calm temperament, if you see things For what they are, if you learn about the world in general, You constantly work on your skill set. And probably the fourth thing I've learned from you is that work on your people skills also. That can be an edge as with the case for any occupation.","The discussion is about the outlook for 2022 in terms of investing and trading in the stock market. While there were big money-making opportunities in 2020, there will still be opportunities to make money in the market in the future. For investing, it is important to identify businesses that are understood and have confidence in and invest systematically over a longer period of time. The market is expected to be volatile in 2022, so active trading is recommended for those who are interested. It is important to have a calm temperament and to work on skill sets, including people skills, in order to succeed in the world of finance."

And I'll just like simplify this. So the top 1% in India two decades ago used to own 23% of India's wealth. So what does that mean? Like 1% of India was owning one fourth of India's wealth. Right. So that's a lot of concentration. In the last two decades, this number of 23% has moved to 33%. So now the top 1% own one third of India's wealth. Now what's happening here? Right. Wealth is getting more and more concentrated in the hands of a few people. What are these guys doing right with their money that folks like us are not doing? One thing they obviously do is they own assets which earn for them. Right. They own businesses, they own ESOPs instead of just renting out their time. So if I'm in a job and that's all the salaries, all the money I make, I'm in a sense renting out my time to my employer. Right. I give you my time, you give me money. Right. But these guys are owning assets that are actually growing. So that is the biggest difference that the wealthy in India are doing or globally also is that they're owning growth assets. They're owning assets in which they're putting money, which over a long period of time will actually multiply in capital. And that's why it's very, very important for us also to ensure that we have growth assets in our portfolio. India is in a transition phase. For a long time, and you spoke about it, right? Everybody would tell you buy a house, put money in an FD, etc. That was okay at a point at which we were trying to maintain our wealth. But now that we have to grow our wealth, you need assets which actually will compound over time. Equities, alternative assets, etc. So I think that's one thing which I've taken away from having managed money for the wealthy is that they're very serious about growth. And it's not just something that, okay, we've invested money, we'll see. They make sure that the money is compounding over a long time.","The Gini coefficient measures wealth concentration, and the top 1% in India used to own 23% of the country's wealth two decades ago, which has now increased to 33%. Wealth is becoming more concentrated in the hands of a few people, who are owning growth assets, such as businesses and ESOPs, instead of just renting out their time for a salary. It is important to have growth assets in your portfolio, such as equities and alternative assets, to compound wealth over time. The wealthy are serious about growth and ensure that their money is compounding over the long term."

You know what the show is about right? It's about Futurism. As in technologies that are around the corner. How they're gonna enter our lives and probably mess shit up for us. Yes. So, Black Mirror talks about elongated life spans in some of the episodes. And generally Futurism is one of the subjects I study a lot. We are heading towards a future where our life spans are actually gonna increase a lot more. We won't die. So, here's something I've thought of a lot. A lot of worldwide intellectuals have also spoken about this concept. And even Ronnie Screwwala spoke about this on the show. He said that now your life has become a lifelong college where you have to keep learning things. 60 is the new 30. So, you know, usually people looked at age 60 as one of those points in your life where you stopped working. Amitabh Bachchan, case in point made most of his current wealth after the age of 60. But this is gonna become a reality for all of us. They say anyone born after say 1980 is actually in for a very long life. That got me thinking about personal finances. So, personal finances used to scare me. Eventually I learned that you roughly need about 3 crores, 4 crores to live a lavish life in Bombay. But what is the truth about this whole scenario, man? Like for a college kid watching this or for a young professional watching this. How should they look at their lifelong finances? You know, I think there was a point in time when we could just like save more money and that would be okay. So, let me just put it in context, right? When I was born in 1980s, the average lifespan of an Indian was 50 years. And you realize how short that is, right? In 10 years I'll be 50. So, that would be the average lifespan of an Indian 4 decades ago. Today the average lifespan of an Indian is close to 70 years. And in about say 10 or 15 years that number will be 80-85. A lot of us here or watching this will probably live to the age of 90 or 95, right? Now to have a decent life at the age of 65 onwards and if you're living till the age of 75 10 years, you need about a crore which will also grow a little bit. You're keeping inflation in mind? Keeping inflation in mind, keeping in fact see if I retire at 65 and I live till the age of 90, I have 25 years ahead of me. And you're already seeing this in the US by the way, that people are running out of money in their older age, right? US has social security, India doesn't have social security. What do you do? We don't have pensions and stuff like that. People are running out of money because of bad planning or because of inflation? No, they didn't factor in the fact that they will live so long. Oh shit! Okay. Right? And in a sense, it's a good thing that medical science has evolved to keep us alive for really long. But now what do you do? You hadn't planned that in your... So conventional retirement logic is like get to 1 crore, this 15-15-15 rule, everything is built around getting to 1 crore. But today now we'll have to get to let's say 5 crores or in dollar terms say a million dollars which is about 7 odd crores. That should become now the new target. Now that has implications on how much we save. Saving is very important. But how we invest what we save is becoming even more important than it ever was. Okay. So let me put you in the spot Mr. Jaito Ani. I'm gonna give you a little game to play. Sure. Game to play. Sure. Game to play. Sure. Game to play. Sure. Game to play. Sure.","The discussion revolves around the concept of increased life spans and how it impacts personal finances. The average lifespan of an Indian has increased from 50 years in the 1980s to close to 70 years today, and it is expected to reach 80-85 years in the future. With people living longer, they need to plan their personal finances differently. Conventional retirement logic of saving 1 crore may not be enough, and people may need to save up to 5 crores or a million dollars to live a decent life after retirement. Therefore, it is essential to not only save but also invest smartly to secure financial stability in the long run."
231,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85aJXuhTehw_sep_600_1048,85aJXuhTehw_sep_600_1048,"take 5000 rupees, 50,000 rupees, 5 lakh rupees and 5 crore rupees as your monthly savings. So say a student or just a young professional is able to save 5000 rupees. Someone who is slightly older is at 50,000 and an established professional is able to save 5 lakh rupees. And say a mega businessman is able to save 5 crore rupees every month. And all four are coming to you. Give me the case A, B, C, D of what you would do as a money expert with that money. So now to answer the question about, see that as your quantum of money is scaling, what needs to also scale is your ability to tolerate risk. When I have 5000, 50,000 to invest every month, the first thing should be that my emergency fund needs to be covered. God forbid something happens to me, my job, etc. There should be enough money for my family to manage lifestyle. And which means that first I will fill the emergency fund bucket. So therefore somebody who is 5000 should potentially be filling up that bucket with all the money that they have. Whereas somebody who is 5 lakhs or 5 crores has probably already filled that bucket. And therefore the money that they have is all available for them to grow. What's a good number for an emergency fund? Again, very dependent on the quality of life you want to retain. I am assuming emergencies are for medical emergencies. What other emergencies can there be? I lose my job and then I have to pay for my family's food, etc. Exactly, roti kapda makaan, school fees, etc. So that differs for different people. The rule of thumb is having 6 months of your lifestyle expenses. Is a good place to start. Where you ensure that at least 6 months of your life expenses are safely parked away. God forbid something happens, I have that. So somebody who is saving 5000, strong recommendation, first fill that bucket. But by the way, we don't see this. We see this gambling thing happen. Where 5000 or 10,000, we double or triple it. And you start seeing a lot of trading and all of that stuff. Crypto, lately, etc. So that's what happens, shouldn't happen. Instead, just get done with your emergency bucket, get your insurance, all of that in place. So that you are in a comfortable place. Now you want to start figuring out how to grow my capital. That's where this becomes important. How much risk can I tolerate? So let's break it down into phases. Step 1, you said take care of your emergency bucket. Step 2, figure out what is the risk you can tolerate. And accordingly decide how much growth assets you will have. So if you are wealthier and you can tolerate a lot of risk, by all means buy more growth assets. Which will compound, which will get you to that 5 crore, 6 crore number. Which you need at retirement to live a really good life for the next 25-30 years. If I am saving say 5 lakh rupees a month. I would probably be putting more money into equity mutual funds etc. Which will compound over a period of time. If I start saving let's say a crore a month. I am now talking about investing in pre-IPO, early stage, late stage start-ups etc. Global assets which will potentially multiply my capital even further. What are global assets? So you know there are many ways to diversify your money. Today most Indians have all of their money in rupee assets. Like everything exposed to India. But globally there are interesting opportunities and we do that on our platform. Where there are interesting opportunities available outside of India. Basically the richer you get, the more options you have in terms of investing your money. What you invest in is totally dependent on your own risk appetite and many other factors like your age etc. But if we boil it down to even like further basics. When you are say at that 50,000 or 5 lakh rupee mark. Usually people are thinking of mutual funds. Thanks to Ankur Varaku no one is thinking of FDs anymore. But you know what are the asset classes would you keep? Maybe gold, REITs, things like that. So yeah, mutual funds is a very broad category by themselves. There is equity funds, there is debt funds, there are hybrid funds, there are international funds, there is gold funds. Very soon you are seeing a lot of other stuff like silver etc. All of that happen right. So mutual funds is a very large category by itself. How does a person with 50,000 rupees as savings know which mutual fund to select? First of all the ideal thing is get an expert to do it for you. But if you can't do that, you don't want to do that. Then I think the right framework would be first figure out what are the different asset classes. So there is equity, debt, gold etc. And then within every asset class there are sub asset classes. So within equity there is index, there is a large cap, mid cap, small cap, many other. And then within them there are... So I would say that start at the top. The biggest decision that you can get right or wrong is what asset classes you have in your portfolio in what proportion. The key thing here is that get that allocation right. Like figure out what is the right equity allocation in your portfolio. Out of 100 rupees, are you putting 50%, 75%, 80%? That's a very personal decision. So let's start with the 50 lakh rupees a month in savings. What do you notice generally happens? That's about the mark that a lot of content creators hit by the way. Not a lot but maybe the ones who have been around for a while. So somebody who has 50 lakh rupees a month, I think the one thing is that probably their core portfolio. Which is there and I'll explain what a core portfolio means. The core portfolio is still growth, still oriented towards appreciation. You want to multiply capital but it is liquid at any point. Now what does liquid mean? You can pull it out at two or three day notice. For somebody who has 50 lakhs rupees a month and has been making it for a few months or a few years, potentially that core bit has now started to get completed. I would normally recommend that if you had overall 100 rupees to invest, 75 should be in this core portfolio. Because this is the portfolio which moves up and down with the markets. But you can pull it out at any point. You might need money, you might decide to start a new business again. And you've created a whole host of businesses. In the future you want to start a third business or a fourth business. This is the capital that you will dip into which should be available to you. So this core portfolio is now ready. You have 50 lakhs a month to invest. What do you do? You start diversifying into what I call alternative investments. You start investing in private equity. You start investing in global hedge funds. You start investing in high yielding or high yielding fixed return instruments like P2P loans etc. Why don't you also just kind of touch upon what the private equity market is? How is it different from the stock market?","The discussion covers personal finance and how one should invest their savings, ranging from INR 5000 to INR 5 crore per month. The first step is to build an emergency fund to cover six months of living expenses in case of any unforeseen events. The amount of risk one can tolerate should then be evaluated. Investment options, including mutual funds, gold, and REITs, should be considered based on the individual's risk tolerance and investment goals. As one becomes wealthier, they have more options for investment, such as pre-IPO, early-stage, and late-stage startups, as well as global assets. In summary, investment strategies should depend on the individual's risk tolerance, investment goals, and asset allocation."

So say a student or just a young professional is able to save five thousand rupees. Someone who's slightly older is at fifty thousand and established professionals able to save five lakh rupees. And say a mega businessman is able to save five crore rupees every month. Yeah. And all four are coming to you. Give me the case A, B, C, D of what you would do as a money expert with that money. So now to answer the question about, see that as your quantum of money is scaling, what needs to also scale is your ability to tolerate risk. Right. When I have five thousand, fifty thousand to invest every month, the first thing should be that my emergency fund needs to be covered. Right. God forbid something happens to me, my job, et cetera. There should be enough money for my family to manage lifestyle. Right. And which means that first I will fill the emergency fund bucket. So therefore somebody who is five thousand should potentially be filling up that bucket with all the money that they have. Right. Whereas somebody who has five lakhs or five crores has probably already filled that bucket. And therefore the money that they have is all available for them to grow. What's a good number for an emergency fund? Again, very dependent on the quality of life you want to retain. Right. I'm assuming emergencies are for medical emergencies. Like what other emergencies can there be? I lose my job. Okay. And then I have to pay for my family's food, et cetera. Exactly. Roti kapda makaan, school fees, et cetera. So that differs for different people. The rule of thumb is having six months of your lifestyle expenses is a good place to start. Where you ensure that at least six months of expenses are there safely parked away. God forbid something happens, I have that. So somebody who is saving five thousand, strong recommendation, first fill that bucket. But by the way, we don't see this, right? We see this gambling thing happen. Where like, let's do something, let's double or triple this. And you start seeing a lot of trading and all of that stuff. Crypto lately, et cetera. So that's what happens, shouldn't happen. Instead just get done with your emergency bucket, get your insurance, all of that in place. So that you are in a comfortable place. Now you want to start figuring out how to grow my capital. That's where this becomes important. How much risk can I tolerate? So let's break it down into phases. Step one, you said take care of your emergency bucket. Step two, figure out what is the risk you can tolerate. And accordingly decide how much growth assets you will have. So if you are wealthier and you can tolerate a lot of risk, by all means buy more growth assets. Which will compound, which will get you to that 5 crore, 6 crore number. Which you need at retirement to live a really good life for the next 25-30 years. If I am saving say 5 lakh rupees a month. I would probably be putting more money into equity mutual funds, et cetera. Which will compound over a period of time. If I start saving, let's say a crore a month. I am now talking about investing in pre-IPO. Early stage, late stage start-ups. Global assets which will potentially multiply my capital even further. What are global assets? So there are many ways to diversify your money. Today most Indians have all of their money in rupee assets. Like everything exposed to India. But globally there are interesting opportunities. And we do that on our platform. Where there are interesting opportunities available outside of India. Basically the richer you get, the more options you will have. What you invest in is totally dependent on your own risk appetite. And many other factors like your age, et cetera. But if we boil it down to even further basics. When you are say at that 50,000 or 5 lakh rupee mark. Usually people are thinking of mutual funds. Thanks to Ankur Varaku, no one is thinking of FDs anymore. But what other asset classes would you keep? Maybe gold, REITs, things like that. So mutual funds, I think, are the most important. There is equity funds, there is debt funds, there are hybrid funds, there are international funds, there is gold funds. Very soon you are seeing a lot of other stuff like silver, et cetera. All of that happen. So mutual funds is a very large category by itself. How does a person with 50,000 rupees as savings know which mutual fund to select? First of all, the ideal thing is getting a mutual fund. And then you can get a mutual fund. And then you can get a mutual fund. And then you can get a mutual fund. So, what is the right framework? First of all, the ideal thing is to get an expert to do it for you. But if you can't do that, you don't want to do that. Then I think the right framework would be first figure out what are the different asset classes. So there is equity, debt, gold, et cetera. And then within every asset class, there are sub asset classes. So within equity, there is an index, there is a large cap, mid cap, small cap, many other. And then within them, there are... So I would say that start at the top. The biggest decision that you can get right or wrong is what asset classes you have in your portfolio in what proportion. The key thing here is that get that allocation right. Like figure out what is the right equity allocation in your portfolio. Out of 100 rupees, are you putting 50%, 75%, 80%? That's a very personal decision. So let's start with a 50 lakh rupee a month in savings. What do you notice generally happens? That's about the mark that a lot of content creators hit by the way. Not a lot, but maybe the ones who have been around for a while. Sure. So somebody who has 50 lakh rupees a month, I think the one thing is that probably their core portfolio. Which is their... I'll explain what a core portfolio means. The core portfolio is still growth, still oriented towards appreciation. You want to multiply capital, but it is liquid at any point. Now what does liquid mean? You can pull it out at two or three day notice. For somebody who has 50 lakhs rupees a month and has been making it for a few months or a few years, potentially that core bit has now started to get completed. I would normally recommend that if you had overall 100 rupees to invest, 75 should be in this core portfolio. Because this is the portfolio which moves up and down with the markets, but you can pull it out at any point. You might need money, you might decide to start a new business again. And you've created a whole host of businesses. In the future, you want to start a third business or a fourth business. This is the capital that you will dip into, which will be available to you. So this core portfolio is now ready. If you have 50 lakhs a month to invest, what do you do? You start diversifying into what I call alternative investments. You start investing in private equity. You start investing in global hedge funds. You start investing in high yielding or high yielding fixed return instruments like P2P loans, etc. Why don't you also just kind of touch upon what the private equity market is? Like how is it different from the stock market? Yeah. So private equity is investing in shares of a company, just as it is on the stock market. Except that in the stock market, you can sell the shares at any point of time and get out. In case of what is private equity, it's private, which means that you can't buy and sell it the way we can buy and sell a stock. In case of the stock markets, usually, and there are exceptions, but usually you place an order to sell within the next 5, 10, 15, 20 minutes, it will get sold. Here, there is no secondary market. You will have to approach other people to sell it. So you have to know that you are invested in this company for a really long period, till you get an opportunity to exit, which is not in your control. So that is private equity. Now, private equity also has multiple stages. And we have done a lot of content around this aspect. So there is, let me start with the safest within private equity. By the way, as an asset class, it's very risky. But the safest within private equity is pre-IPO, which is a company just before it is going to get listed. Right. So that is pre-IPO. Then there is late stage equity. Late stage equity is companies mature, doing reasonably well, but not yet ready to go towards an IPO. Then there are mid-stage companies, which are companies which have potentially just turned profitable, or are beginning to now turn profitable. And then there are early stage companies. Early stage companies are very early, maybe 3 or 4 years in their journey, potentially still requiring capital to survive and grow. And then there are seed. Seed is where a company is not even formed. It's just an idea and a team. And you are funding that. Now what happens is the risk level goes higher as you go down this. So the pre-IPO is the least risky among private equity. And seed is the most aggressive among private equity. What do smart people do? Even within private equity, suppose I had 100 rupees to invest, I would put more money on the pre-IPO side and much lesser money on the risky side. Risky stuff. But you have to know this, that this money is not available to you whenever you want it. This is like you parked it away and your life shouldn't depend on this. But we are talking about the 5 crore mark Mr. Chetwani. What would you do if someone is saving 5 crore rupees every month? What would you do with that bag of money?","The discussion revolves around personal finance, the need to invest in growth assets, and the importance of planning for a longer lifespan. The conversation highlights the change in the average lifespan of people over the years, and how it impacts retirement planning. The traditional approach of saving money is no longer enough. Investment in growth assets, such as equities and alternative assets, is necessary to compound wealth over time. The higher the investment amount, the more the risk tolerance must increase. Emergency funds are necessary for all investment plans. The conversation concludes with a game, where four investment scenarios are presented based on monthly savings amounts of 5,000 rupees, 50,000 rupees, 5 lakh rupees, and 5 crore rupees. The expert emphasizes the importance of emergency funds and suggests a different investment approach based on the risk tolerance of each scenario."
233,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85aJXuhTehw_sep_1207_1919,85aJXuhTehw_sep_1207_1919,"They are owning assets in which they have put in money, which over a long period of time will actually multiply in capital. And that's why it's very, very important for us also to ensure that we have growth assets in our portfolio. India is in a transition phase. For a long time, and you spoke about it, right? Everybody would tell you, buy a house, put money in an FD, etc. That was okay at a point at which we were trying to maintain our wealth. But now that we have to grow our wealth, you need assets which actually will compound over time. Equities, alternative assets, etc. So I think that's one thing which I've taken away from having managed money for the wealthy, is that they are very serious about growth. And it's not just something that, okay, we've invested money, we'll see. They make sure that the money is compounding over a long period of time. Where our life spans are actually going to increase a lot more. We won't die. So here's something I've thought of a lot. A lot of worldwide intellectuals have also spoken about this concept. And even Ronnie Screwwala spoke about this on the show. He said that now your life has become a lifelong college where you have to keep learning things. Correct. 60 is the new 30. So, you know, usually people looked at age 60 as one of those points in your life where you stopped working. Amitabh Bachchan, case in point, made most of his current wealth after the age of 60. Correct. But this is going to become a reality for all of us. They say anyone born after, say, 1980 is actually in for a very long life. That got me thinking about personal finances. So personal finances used to scare me. Eventually I learned that you roughly need about 3 crores, 4 crores to live a lavish life in Bombay. But what is the truth about this whole scenario, man? Like for a college kid watching this or for a young professional watching this, how should they look at their lifelong finances? You know, I think there was a point in time when we could just like save more money and that would be okay. So let me just put it in context, right? When I was born in 1980s, the average lifespan of an Indian was 50 years. And you realize how short that is, right? In 10 years, I'll be 50. So that would be the average lifespan of an Indian four decades ago. Today, the average lifespan of an Indian is close to 70 years. And in about, say, 10 or 15 years, that number will be 80, 85. A lot of us here or watching this will probably live to the age of 90 and 95. I want to have a decent life at the age of 65 onwards. And if you're living till the age of 75, 10 years, you need about a crore, which will also grow a little bit. You're keeping inflation in mind. Keeping inflation in mind, keeping in fact that, see, if I retired at 65 and lived till the age of 90, I have 25 years ahead of me. Okay. And you're already seeing this in the US, by the way, that people are running out of money in their older age, right? US has social security. India doesn't have social security. What do you do? We don't have pensions and stuff like that. People are running out of money because of bad planning or because of inflation? No, they didn't factor in the fact that they will live so long. Oh, shit. Okay. Right? And in a sense, it's a good thing that medical science has evolved to keep us alive for really long. But now what do you do? When you had you hadn't planned that in your so conventional retirement logic is like get to one crore. This 15, 15, 15 rule. Everything is built around getting to one crore. But today now we'll have to get to, let's say, five crores or in dollar terms, say, a million dollars, which is about seven crores. That should become now the new target. Now that has implications on how much we save. Saving is very important, but how we invest what we save is becoming even more important than it ever was. Okay. So let me put you in the spot, Mr. Jaito Ani. I'm going to give you a little game to play. Sure. Let's take five thousand rupees, fifty thousand rupees, five lakh rupees and five crore rupees as your monthly savings. So say a student or just a young professional is able to save five thousand rupees. Someone who's slightly older is at fifty thousand and established professionals able to save five lakh rupees. And say a mega businessman is able to save five crore rupees every month. Yeah. And all four are coming to you. Give me the case A, B, C, D of what you would do as a money expert with that money.

What would you do with that bag of money?","The discussion centers around the importance of investing in assets that compound over time for growth, given the increase in life expectancy. India is transitioning from conventional wisdom of investing in fixed deposits and real estate to growth assets such as equities and alternative assets. As life expectancy increases, one must plan for their finances for a longer lifespan, and it is crucial to consider factors such as inflation and lack of social security and pensions. The more one can save, the more they need to invest in higher-risk assets. Emergency funds should be the priority while investing in lower-risk assets when one has five thousand to fifty thousand to invest every month. As the investment amount increases, the focus should shift towards higher-risk assets such as equities, mutual funds, and alternative assets, and the importance of diversification increases."
234,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85aJXuhTehw_sep_1920_2431,85aJXuhTehw_sep_1920_2431,"thing that which you know Rockefeller said once that sex and money are two things that only in the bedroom that you talk about, you don't talk about in the living room. At least now money you talk about in the living room. I didn't know that was a quote dude, that's such a reflection of society back then. For me talking about money is a very normalised thing man. It wasn't right, it would be crass to talk about oh I'm saving this much and I'm investing here etc. It's a generational change. Probably like in my parents generation nobody would talk about money right. You would probably show it off but you wouldn't say that okay I'm buying this or investing here etc. And that's the good thing about what financial influencers on YouTube have done. But the thing is that if I am somebody who absorbing that content, I shouldn't like just copy what they are saying because what they are saying maybe applies in a generic sense to most people. It may or may not apply to me. Like if somebody tells me to buy this stock, they don't know what my other portfolio is. They don't know how much risk I can handle. It's like getting medical advice online in a way. Yeah and you don't do that right. You don't go to a chemist and say okay tell me. You would go to a professional doctor who will tell you what to do. So I think that is one thing that India doesn't have enough of financial advisors and this problem was most acute a few years back and therefore a lot of these Bollywood personalities who made it big lost money and ended up in poverty. So I think that is one thing that is changing I feel with the new generation. Have you seen that with cricketers also or like sportsmen where they are now really smart about their money, their contracts etc. And that's the great thing. So I would think that a lot of influencers potentially don't like put thought behind the fact that unless they reinvent themselves and even then there is a risk that the current cash flow may not last. So what they have right now needs to be invested really well so that when the sparks burn out and they move to some other thing, they have enough capital to survive. On YouTube, I know why we are talking about YouTube in this finance conversation but the most painful part of this career as a creator is the phase of reinvention which lasts three to six months. It's horrible. And you don't even know whether it will work right? Exactly and often it doesn't. So a reinvention phase is often not just one reinvention then you're good. It's three four experiments all of which suck because the thing is you're getting your clout and your money and your name through the numbers you're bringing in through your fame basically. And in that three to six months period, why have you even begun reinventing because your numbers have gone down. So you need to change some shit up. Now imagine you do an experiment which fails. You expected to bring you up. It takes you down even further. And then it's a spiral. Yeah. So and a lot of people get lost in that downward spiral. It's a very mentally traumatic game and I'm not trying to highlight YouTube as this whole year than thou career or anything. I'm just sharing perspective. I've done it thrice maybe in my entire seven year journey, but fuck I don't wish it on anyone dude. Like you go through a lot again. You know why? Because you are the face of that business. You are that one person in that business, which is why, which answers my previous question in terms of why did I put money into something? The answer was because there wasn't just one face. That was a system dependent thing. It was a team that I was investing in not myself. So tell me how do you like, how do you keep your sanity during the point where, and you know the thing with influencers and to a certain extent also with entrepreneurs is that you attribute everything to yourself, right? Success or failure is an attributed to yourself and when it's success, it's heady, right? It's great. Everything is good. But when it's a failure, it feels like it's happening because of me. So how did you like break out of that mental zone? At this stage, honestly, it's about Ubuntu because in reinventions, the pressure also gets divided into like my top team, like top layer of my team. I've consciously hired a lot of leaders to work with me across all the four startups. Be it monkey, I have a leadership core, which I work with directly. Be it beer biceps, I have my top layer of leaders who take, make their own decisions. They add a certain energy to the whole room, to the whole office. That helps me from a mental health perspective. Yeah. How do you break out of that? Like if you're in a downward spiral where some of the content that you're putting out is not working, how do you like pick up yourself and say again, the next day, try something new? Dude, you have to just, you would just plumb through it. Like it's not nice, man, because sometimes even that plummeling, again, it takes six months. So you're just trying different experiments all the time and just eating up the failures, moving on to the next one. Parallel, you're getting so much feedback from your management, from your PR, from your own team, from your audience. Too much feedback sometimes? I think that's the trick. Like can you manage to take all that feedback and still look at it very like from like a detached perspective and look at it as an engineer and mathematical. Yeah, actually a lot of people, like even in life and in business, right? You feel like this has got me here. So let me keep squeezing. And there's only so much juice and orange will deliver to you right after that you throw it and get something else. So I think that's really unique, right? Not many people get that. You said you work with a lot of influencers, creators. What do you notice? Because you know, you're someone who, if you're managing someone's money, you'll get to know the person, you'll get to know their priorities. What do you notice? Everyone's different or there are some similarities? Everyone is different because now the interesting thing is that there are influencers across age groups. So there are influencers who are older who've seen periods where they didn't have enough money, etc. So they have, whereas some of these younger influencers, like you spoke about, have made a decent amount of money very early on. So their perspective on life and money is different. You're shaped by your own experience, right? And Morgan Housel has an interesting quote where your experience is 0.0001% of the world's experiences, but it is 100% of your decision making. So everyone is different. But the thing with older influencers also, they're very focused on creating a strong pool of second income from their money. Right? They want, because they know that this can stop sometime. They will try new things. They will try and reinvent themselves, but sometimes it may not work. What do you count me as an older influencer? I don't give a shit about age and all that. No, so I think you're an experienced guy. You've sort of been through this and you've created multiple businesses. I would put you in the sort of more mature influencer category. The reason I ask you this is I want to understand what you mean by the subjective word older. Do you mean someone with a family? Do you mean post 35 or something? No, somebody who's seen the cycle of a business going up and down. Got you. So actually, let me rephrase that. It's not older but mature. Then you know that this can, the party can stop either briefly or permanently. And therefore you plan your money in such a way that it will last you longer. And this is true for sports people as well as actors and then people from the media. It's relevant to any profession which has a potential shorter lifespan, right? Till the time you reinvent yourself. And you know, in other professions also it happens, but that period is much longer. So if I am a doctor, yes, new technology will come in to replace me. At some point, let's say if I'm a surgeon, robotic surgery is coming in and over time they will take over. But it's a slow process. It doesn't happen overnight. So because it's a high stakes thing, right? When I am as a patient putting my life in the hands of a robot, most people are still not comfortable. They would want an experienced surgeon to handle it. But in low stakes stuff like entertainment, the change can be much faster. So if you are in a low stakes, where the consumer, for the consumer it's a low stake investment, then your lifespan as a creator or as a professional overall can be shorter. And therefore preparing for that is very important.","The discussion covers various aspects of finance and entrepreneurship. It is noted that in the past, talking about money was seen as crass, but this is changing. While financial influencers on YouTube have helped to normalise conversations about money, it is important to exercise caution and not blindly follow their advice. The lack of financial advisors in India has led to many Bollywood personalities losing money and ending up in poverty. It is also noted that the reinvention phase of a creator's career can be mentally traumatic, and failure can feel like a personal failure. However, having a strong team of leaders can help to alleviate some of the pressure. Finally, the importance of managing feedback is highlighted, as too much feedback can be overwhelming."

What do you think Adani and Mukesh Ambani do with their own money? And by that, I mean not reliance as money or Adani groups money, their own money as men. For them, I think it's about like, it's now beyond money. It's beyond the returns that the money is generating. There's a concept of self-actualization, Maslow's hierarchy, right? Once you reach a certain stage and age, you don't care so much about the next five crores, 10 crores, et cetera. You're about what impact am I creating? Am I creating a legacy? And I think a lot of these folks are now creating a legacy, right? They're more concerned about what they can do with their money that will actually create meaningful impact such that people will remember them for that. So I think it's the concept of self-actualization basically. Something interesting you said. I actually had Sadhguru on the show recently. And Sadhguru has this ability to kind of, I mean, at the end of the day, he's, he's an old wise evolved man. I asked him advice for myself and legacy was one of those things I was thinking about a lot, not because I have hit a point in my financial journey where I feel like I'm done, I'm not done at all, long way to go. But I just was thinking about legacy as a concept because I heard some people on the show tell me that legacy is their driving force. So it got me thinking about what my legacy is. And that was a question I didn't have an answer to other than social work, which I've been doing for a while. And I asked him, you know, what, I mean, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't say anything about legacy. I think he guessed it through my questions or whatever. And he said that if you wish for your name to be remembered, even beyond your death, instead of thinking about what you can build, just focus on immensely helping people make their own lives easier right now. And I guess you're already doing that, no? Like, like there's so many people listening to your podcasts, taking away stuff, like we have people in my office who were big fans of TRS and for them, it's about like, they would rather spend that one and a half hours or two hours of their life listening to this because they're taking away something which can help them, right? It's not, it's not only entertainment now. I'm aware of the fact that I know my content is deep. I know it's evergreen, et cetera, et cetera. I'm always asking myself, okay, what next in terms of, I really want to get into people's houses and help them. So I have this one dream of, what do I want to do specifically in social work? Definitely want to help orphans, want to help old people and want to help stray animals. Why can't I create places in and around big metros, which combine all three in one location and to make it mutually beneficial. You know, the interesting thing with even this or social work or philanthropy in general is that even when you're talking about this with your investment manager, wealth manager, this has to be self, you know, it paying for itself. Like, you know, any philanthropy or any charity that you run or do, if it is dependent on you continuing to fund it, then there's a problem, right? Because it will then like after a certain point of time, you will have different priorities will move on to another charity. There'll be a bigger cause that you will have to sort of pay attention to, right? I'm assuming that this is what they mean by trusts. Like when you say trustees or trusts, that's what trusts do. It's a big bag of money, which is handled by financial experts. Therefore, this profits coming out from that same bag of money, and then it's fueled into like social work. It that can happen for sure and must happen, right? The money that you put inside that trust should grow and now section eight companies, different ways to manage it, but should grow in and of itself to serve and support that charity. But we have to look at charities and trusts also as a business and not for profit business, right? In the sense that can they generate revenue over and above the investment returns such that they can fund themselves. And that's the power of like social media. Your own brand can get attached to it in a way that people who also believe in that cause would love to participate if they know Ranveer is backing it. Right? And I think that is the true legacy, because then you've made a sort of charity or a philanthropy, which is running on its own. Whoa. I feel super Cindy today. Thank you, Mr. Jethwani.","In this podcast episode, the host and guest discuss the concept of self-actualization and legacy in regards to wealthy individuals like Adani and Mukesh Ambani. They suggest that once individuals reach a certain point of wealth, they are less concerned with accumulating more money and instead focus on creating a meaningful impact and leaving a lasting legacy. The guest shares advice given to him by Sadhguru on how to create a legacy by helping others in the present moment. They also discuss the importance of ensuring that philanthropy and charitable endeavors are self-sustaining and can generate revenue beyond just investment returns."

No, it's a big responsibility, man. I think managing money is so personal to everyone, right? And for everyone, it's about what it can do for their lives and their family. That we lose sleep over how we are managing money for everyone else. Do you have any feedback for me? And I want to ask you about the tough feedback. In terms of, I know you've done some maths about my situation. But what do you think? Do you have any advice? What do you think I'm doing wrong? I wouldn't say wrong, Ranveer. I think the thing is that, you know, you've actually figured out the fact that you have to invest in new businesses. And I don't mean it in a way to flatter you. But a lot of people don't get that. That you have to convert from a place where Naval Ravi Khan talks about it, where you're renting your time to owning a share of an asset where other people are working for you. And I think that transition everyone has to learn from. So, I think the fact that you're at this age, having a conversation about money, thinking about where to put money, I think that's the best thing. So, I think that comes from a place of humility, by the way. Really? Because you know that this may not last, this party may not last. And that is in a sense an acceptance of the fact that, if this doesn't work, which means that you're accepting the fact that at some point, this might not work, you're creating new sources of income, new assets. For me, I mean, you know, I think fiction, like fictional movies, shows and mainstream sports are a good reflection of where society is at. So, be it the Indian cricket team, which has suddenly become aggressive and kind of going for it against Australia or England, versus the movies we see nowadays about growth and, you know, optimism and patriotism. I would like to believe that India is in this very kind of aggressive hunting mode, which I love. As a capitalist, because one, it satisfies me and my financial ambitions on a personal level, but two, for the country, it's fantastic. I also strongly believe that no government in the world is capable of changing a country the size of India overnight. And it's going to be the entrepreneurs and the thought leaders who actually create on the ground kind of changes. So, it's a good place to be going, man. Absolutely, and we are all lucky to be living in this country at this point in time. For sure. Jai Jhulelal! That's all I wanted to end it with. Thank you, Sandeep. Thanks, Sandeep. Really had fun on this. I'm glad I think people gained a lot of value and we'll see you soon, Mr. Jeethwari. See you soon.","The conversation discusses the personal responsibility of managing one's money and how it is different for each individual. The speaker expresses the importance of investing in new businesses and assets, and transitioning from renting time to owning a share of an asset where others work for you. The conversation also touches on the current aggressive and entrepreneurial mindset in India, and the role of entrepreneurs and thought leaders in creating on-the-ground changes. The conversation ends with appreciation for the country and a cultural reference. Overall, the discussion emphasizes the importance of personal financial management and investing in assets for long-term financial security."

And then once the Harsha Mehta scandal happened, which happened after the first InvestFest. Now, before that, people were irrationally entering the market. Therefore, we said, do an investor education event. So there's a lot of speakers coming to InvestFest, all free of cost, social activity. And then post Harsha Mehta scandal, they started equally irrationally exiting the market. Panic sell kind of thing. That's also not right there. So what can we do to bring them back? Like I said, none of my business, frankly, I'm not a stock exchange, I have nothing to do, I'm not a government. But this was our contribution. So I conceived a game that time, which was played with everything real except money, imaginary money. Now become popular through the mock stock and stock 1992. So we called it the Lamco stock scan. My company is called Lamco. We started because I live in Pune, we announced it in Pune. Oh, it became such a hit, we had a homegrown software to evaluate and give away prizes and so on. That became a hit in Pune. Next year, we got ambitious. So again, it became an annual event. Next year, we took it to Bombay. It became a hit in Bombay. Coincidentally, one day I was in the offices of Business India magazine, that was Business India leading magazine. So Mr. Ashok Adwani, wonderful gentleman who owns it, I was sitting and talking with him and somehow the talk went to this stock scan. I didn't even know it. I've always been keen to do something like this. Let's join hands. So they became my partners, then it became the Business India stock scan and we took it city by city almost all over the country, trying to teach people how to invest. So what I'm saying is, I'm not a broker, I don't make money for these things. But somehow I've had that one corner of mine is, you know, the whole country should invest, what can we do? So through Investfest and stock scan, etc. So to answer your question, since I'm not into it from that angle, investing has never been in efforts, forwards and futures and trade. Is it long term investing? Is something fundamental? I believed in a long term plan. But I also have a very big soft corner, which now doesn't make sense, but it did then for real estate. So my portfolio has undergone a lot of changes. I stocks you can start buying at any time and build it. Good real estate opportunity come, I would liquidate and put it there. It would start all over again. The kind of journey so far as stock markets, stock markets, stock markets, stock markets.","The discussion revolves around the concept of investor education and the promotion of long-term investment in the stock market. The speaker mentions the Harshad Mehta scandal and how it led to irrational behavior in the market, both in terms of entering and exiting. To address this issue, the speaker conceived a game called the Lamco stock scan, which simulated real stock market trading without real money. The game became popular and evolved into the Business India stock scan, which was held across the country to promote investor education. The speaker also mentions his preference for long-term investment and real estate, and how his portfolio has changed over time. Overall, the discussion highlights the importance of educating investors and promoting a long-term investment approach."
238,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=238GhW18-eE_sep_1186_1462,238GhW18-eE_sep_1186_1462,"Sir, what is your take on the stock market today? I think you've seen multiple cycles. What is happening today? I am scared, Shashank. I could be wrong and I have been wrong since the pandemic. That's fine. I mean, nobody knows what's going to happen but it is weird. Since the pandemic started, my personal opinion was this market should crash. Businesses are shutting down. Everything is going down. Exactly. And the stock market is going up. 100%. There are phases where the stock market beats all logic. Then you say, no, it will fall but it goes up further. I said, no, I am going to wait for it to fall. So that formal thing sets in amongst everybody. But I am not going to succumb to that and pick it up at these values. For one, I am waiting. I am not hoping for a crash but I am waiting. The day the crash happens, I have listed out what I want to buy. I have put prices at which I want to buy. When it falls to that, one thing I have learned is that the stock market doesn't hurry. That is where you get to know that you don't do it and it goes further. Then you say, no, I have made a mistake. Let me get in. Then you get in at the highest. And then it falls. You lose all money. So I really don't have an answer for you. What's going to happen, I don't know. I have a feeling this is not sustainable. I agree. This is something that I saw. When the market fell on March 24th, almost down to 25-26,000 points. And then if you map it after that, one year later, it has gone up to 50,000. Which is 100% index. Whereas when it fell to that, I was hoping, thinking it will fall further. I thought it will last for another 6-8 months until COVID is gone, until businesses come back. So clarity should come. Which direction are we going and when will we think normal? I didn't understand that because even aviation sector, IRCTC, aviation companies, which were supposed to not be up even now because nothing has opened up yet, but it's still doing well. IRCTC is still understandable, but aviation is not understandable at all. There are a lot of things that didn't connect for me. Even the banking stocks. NPAs, I knew for a fact, will obviously go up because a lot of SMEs and MSMEs were suffering during the COVID time. And I'm like, how will that NPA look? And it was never being reflected. In fact, it was showing as good, good, good. So that is something that even I am... I mean, people talk about inflation going up, but that's okay because that's a thing with growth. But also there's a lot of money being pumped in on both sides. See, I just understand why the stock market is going up because, especially not in India, but India also mirrors what happens in the rest of the world. Like in America, the government was giving lots of stimulus checks. Now the money was there in people's hands. We were not, nobody is moving out. Your spending is down, spending on entertainment, spending on eating out and you're getting stimulus checks. So all this money found its way into the stock market. So that logic is there. Demand supply will make the price go up. But then the rest of them start following and start buying because market is going up and that makes it a speculative bubble. Yeah. Yeah. I think that happened with India as well. I think we saw the record number of Demand accounts opening number one. Then we went into that form of culture where the worst part or the scariest part was first knowledge when they entered the market. So everyone thought this is how the stock market is. This is how the bull run works. If I invest in the stock market, 25% or some minimum in a year. And I have seen some people saying I want 100% returns in a month. And that's when one crypto thing happened. Everyone ran to crypto saying 100% 200% 35 says 70 rupees. And I'm like, guys, this is not how a market works. If you get 15%, you should consider yourself, you know, godly lucky. And here you're getting 25, 30% like this easily. I mean, if Mr. Musk makes a statement and market goes up and he makes another statement and it comes down tells you the fickle nature of that. And a lot of people are betting on that. I'm like, are you his friend? Do you know when he's tweeting? But you're still taking your life money gambling it on. And I'm like, it's as equal to going to go up putting 32 or a Jule number and waiting for that's the same odds. That's the same odds. I mean, you're playing on those games. But I think that people understood when the crypto market fell, a lot of people burned their hands and they realized, oh, shit. OK, but now we have stock market coming up with a lot of IPOs, almost every IPO going for a bumper listing kind of. So again, that's happening here. And I think it's happening here.","The discussion revolves around the current state of the stock market, with the speaker expressing confusion and concern about its performance during the pandemic. Despite businesses shutting down and the economy struggling, the stock market has continued to rise, which the speaker finds illogical. They are hesitant to invest at current values and are waiting for a potential crash to make purchases. The speaker also notes the speculative bubble and fickle nature of the market, with people taking risks based on rumors and statements made by figures like Elon Musk. The speaker acknowledges the high demand for IPOs and the potential for a bumper listing but remains cautious about investing in the current market."
239,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=238GhW18-eE_sep_1463_1939,238GhW18-eE_sep_1463_1939,"What is your take on IPO? I understand why startups come out with a lot of startups coming out with IPO. I understand that perspective but what do you think is coming up? I have stopped investing in IPO because we are from an era where in the initial public offering, the shares were available at very very close to face value. Those days, and this is all the time where Investfest of mine started, before that also when I told you markets were booming, I also used to have one division which was into opinion polls. And one of the polls I used to do every week and publish it in the newspaper was on the IPOs of that week and each week there were 10 to 15 IPOs. At that time? 10 to 15. And we used to do an opinion poll, what do you think? And we had a database for that opinion poll of about 300 brokers and so many investors and so many this. And I know for a fact that my opinion poll which was published used to influence this issue. 100% Yes. People read it with a check to sign and they would read the opinion poll that 85% people said it's not a good issue, they would change their mind and not invest. So it was molding opinion. Now those days, there used to be an institution called CCI, control of capital issues. Okay. Anyone wanting to charge a premium had to take permission from CCI. Wow. Now imagine you are a promoter, you started your company, you issued a first public issue, 10 rupee share was sold for 10 rupees, and then you did phenomenally well. And your stock market price kept going up, it became say 300 rupees now. And now you want another public issue. So you'll obviously say if people buy my share from me at 10 and sell it in the market for 300, I would like to get some benefit of that. So I want to sell my share at a premium. Correct. And you had to apply to CCI. Correct. If CCI had a ridiculous formula, they would apply formula they say yes yes yes you deserve a premium I think you can sell your 10 rupee share at a 3 rupee premium, 5 rupee something as ridiculous as that. That's weird. Consequently you could pick up gems. Yeah, those days the stock market IPO's were oversubscribed hundreds of times also. Oh wow. Tata Timkin I remember there was a collaboration between Tata's and Timkin. Many companies were oversubscribed 50 times, 60 times, 150 times, 200 times, Kinetic Honda was oversubscribed 150 times. All this was before DMAT? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Proper physical. Yeah, yeah. DMAT ka ek aur story hai, we can't discuss here. Some powerful industrialists didn't let it happen. Because why? Because there were huge number of duplicate shares in circulation. It's a scary thing. Any promoter actually has the power of RBI. RBI can print money, print shares and sell it whenever they want. Bogus shares, right? Yeah. And if a thief does it he'll get caught. But if the promoter himself does it who's going to catch him. And if you do DMAT all your duplicate shares will come out so these industrialists never let it happen. Wow. That's a different thing. So those days you could get a wonderful share at 12-13. So Tata Timkin was oversubscribed Shashank, 4000 times. Are you kidding me? My God. Imagine if they wanted to raise 10 crores, they raised 40,000 crores. Holy shit. And they had to return 39,990 crores back. Shit. That company made a profit and they were brilliant. In the first year, why? Because that extra money they hung on for two months before they gave it back and on the interest they earned. Second year onward the company started making a loss and it continued making a loss till the collaboration broke and Timkin went back. But here, what they got. So I am used to those. And now the shares are sold at 600 premium. I can't imagine. Very often they get listed below what you paid. So for me, the charm of IPO is out. I'd rather wait. And very often you can pick it up at a lower price after it lists. Most of the times, yes. My own investment started. My first ever I remember, so I distinctly remember these things. When I had become a fresh CA, that's when I started taking interest in stocks. And there was a company called SKF. Not SKF, ball bearing company. But this is E-S-K-Y-E-F. And it had come out with a 10 rupee share at an 8 rupee premium. Wow. So I had applied for it. I'd made three applications. My name, mom's name, dad's name. These are the wrong things one does. A lot of people are doing that now also. So I managed to get 100 shares at 1800. Look at the percentage, don't look at the amounts. And then when a share is public issue comes out, rumors start going around in the market at what price it will get listed. Correct. And the rumor for SKF was it will get listed at about 80. Oh my, that's too much. When these rumors determine the price. So it actually listed at 80. Are you serious? Oh my God. It was the biggest investment of my life. Bought 100 shares at 18, listed at 80. It was a thrill. Everyday watched the newspaper. Next day 90, then 100, then 120, then 150. It went up to 180. Oh my God. And kept watching. You didn't sell. And then it came down 150, 130, 100. Came down to 80. So what the hell is happening? Then at 80 I said let me sell. But I sold half my holding. So at 50 at 80 bucks is 4000. I invested 1800. Sold half my holding at 4000. It started going up again. And soon went back to 180. Then I sold the remaining 50 for 9000. So imagine an 1800 investment got me 13000. All within a matter of three months. That's not sustainable. That's not good. No, no. But those days it was the... Normal. The problem was Shashank, getting allotment was a big lottery. So it worked out a strategy. And I used to recommend in my columns. That you know put a kitty. Say I want to invest in IP. First public issue, can't put it. Most likely you won't get it. Because like a lottery, heavily oversubscribed. But so many issues come. The moment it comes back. Put it in the next one. It may come back. Put it in the next one. It may come back. If you do three, four times at least once you'll get allotment. And those days there was this wonderful thing. I'm forgetting the name. These banks had come out with these instruments. They said don't invest money. Put it in FD. And they will give you this instrument which you could use for applying for IPO. And even when you get allotted the FD will break. So we said listen, do this. Put that one lakh in FD. If you don't get allotment you're earning FD interest. And even if once you get allotment. And out of one lakh you get 30,000 rupees worth of shares. It will sell for so much. The average return would go to 20-25. I love banks. They'll make a product out of any need and demand. A lot of innovation used to happen. It's too good this one. A wonderful time to be in. And I used to be because I was writing. I was always keeping track of what's happening. Wow. Then one fine day.","The discussion is about the Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) in the Indian stock market. The speaker talks about the past and present trends in the IPO market. In the past, IPOs were available at face value or a slight premium, and the Control of Capital Issues (CCI) institution governed the premium charged. The speaker talks about the oversubscription of IPOs by hundreds of times, which were sold at low prices but later listed at high prices. The speaker mentions a few examples of such IPOs, such as Tata Timkin and Kinetic Honda. In the present, IPOs are sold at high premiums, and the speaker prefers waiting for a lower price post-listing instead of investing in an IPO.

I mean, we're not idiots. If my share is selling for 300, I will not sell a 10 rupee share for a 190 rupee premium. Nobody will buy. First of all, the moment a public issue happens, the number of shares goes up, the price should become half in the number of shares doubled. So 300 rupee will become 150. Now, if I sell it at 150, they're still not attractive. So I'll probably sell 70-80 bucks premium so that it's win-win. You know, the buyer will tell me at what price to sell. They abolish CCI. And suddenly we went into what is known as a free pricing regime. Wow. Now, if I remember correctly, I always get confused between this name. It's either MRPL, Mangalore refinery, or Tamil Nadu petrol, TNPL, one of these two, I'm forgetting one of them was the first public issue to come out after the CCI got abolished. And a 10 rupee share was offered at 145 rupee premium. 155. Now, suddenly, you know, earlier on, not only promoters used to criticize CCI, even investors used to criticize CCI. I don't know why they were the biggest beneficiaries of CCI. And suddenly these investors started saying, yeah, now what do we do? Should we invest? There's nobody to, you know, help us, guide us, hold our hands. We need something like a CCI. Now this MRPL or TNPL, whichever it was, 155, you study the market price, it was 180-185. Somehow the issue got subscribed, maybe slightly oversubscribed, no more 100. And the day it got listed, it started selling below 155. We need somebody to invest in protection. Now to fill the void created by the abolition of CCI, SEBI was born. Oh, wow. SEBI got created.","The discussion revolves around the abolition of CCI (Controller of Capital Issues), a regulatory body that used to control the pricing of public issues of securities. After its abolition, the market entered into a free pricing regime. The discussion highlights the first public issue after the abolition of CCI and how investors and promoters were initially critical of CCI, but after its abolition, investors felt the need for guidance and protection. This led to the creation of SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India) to fill the void left by the abolition of CCI."

I'm like, what's happening? Suddenly there's a bad bank coming. It's become very sterilised, all the laws. Like today, you have a takeover court. You want to take over a company. But those days, it was fun because there were hostile takeovers. Hostile takeovers, yeah. Identifying promoters having less share than somebody like a predator comes.

Which I don't know what's happening.","The discussion revolves around the exciting times of the finance industry in the past, where there were hostile takeovers and controversies such as the Dhirubhai Ambani and Nasli Wadia fight. The conversation highlights the difference between then and now, with current finance laws being more sterilized. The speakers also touch on the introduction of SEBI, the abolition of CCI, and the birth of a free pricing regime. They discuss the excitement of the finance industry and the juicy inside gossip that they have acquired from being part of it. The conversation ends with the speakers discussing their lack of understanding of cryptocurrency and its potential impact on the finance industry."

Listening to the stories, I'm like, yeah, the only thing is Zomato IPR, let's talk about that. We've lived through those times where India liberalized. Dr. Manmohan Singh changed the face of India. Prior to that, what it was and post and then how things happened and how... So every day something used to happen. And India is going through a balance of payment crisis and how are you trying to come out? And they come out with the schemes. Manmohan Singh came out with a brilliant move. You know, India had two problems. India had a problem of Forex. Some of your readers will know that before Dr. Manmohan Singh, for 10 days Mr. Yashwant Sinha... You know, Chandrasekhar had formed the government and Yashwant Sinha was the Finance Minister. And a Forex position was so precarious, we didn't have money to make three days of imports. Three days. And he went and pawned our gold with the Bank of England and borrowed money. And the first, almost the first act of Dr. Manmohan Singh when he became Finance Minister was... He somehow organized the money, returned the loan, brought the gold back. And then he came out with a brilliant move. And I used to write articles on those that he said, any money coming into the country in foreign exchange, no question asked. This was literally an invitation to all the people who have black money stashed away. That you know, send your money out through Hawala. Tell some uncle, some friend, some cousin, make a demand draft and send it back. No question asked. No question, nothing. No tracking. So now what happened, he killed two birds with one stone. Number one, this black money got converted to white. And number two, it came in the form of foreign exchange. So you sorted your foreign exchange problem. Because black money is something one day you should do a session only on black money. Black money is like cancer. Because if you don't pay tax, I mean to avoid paying tax, you generate black money. That you won't spend. But you'll spend and pay somebody else in cash. That guy will spend, so it moves in parallel circles. So it's called the parallel economy. Government get nothing. But on the other hand, once it becomes white, government earns from it in perpetuity. So it's very very important for it to happen. It's very interesting. I think the lower income group suffers from this. I mean from a black economy. They will get no benefit. If the government earns out of it, then government uses that money for development. For roads, for bridges, for power, whatever. If the government doesn't get the money, how will they do it? I mean the government has its own problem, the corruption, leakage etc. But still, some money will come to the benefit of people. So black money is a curse. These things used to happen. Something like this earth shaking would happen every day. I'm getting so much foam. No, I'm getting foam of the past. Not of the present. I'm getting foam of the past. Shit. No, this is insane. So I have another question, right? Are you planning to write another book? Is there something else coming up? I am. You know, I rightly or wrongly started feeling there are too many of my books out there. When I'm cluttering the shelves. And what will happen? Instead of buying this, you'll buy that. So no additional will happen. So I wasted the whole pandemic period. But now I'm working on one. Is it going to be different? Yeah, it has to be. And I'm working one on scams. My favourite area. Oh, beautiful. Please send me a copy. This is too good. I think this is the first time I'm getting a foam of the past. Sashant, you are young. That's a great thing. You got the right attitude. You got the right level of interest. You got a very, very exciting future. No foam. Look ahead. Equal amounts. Scandals will keep happening. The world will never improve. You are going to experience now. It's your next 50. Next 50. Next 50. Next 50. Next 50. Next 50. Next 50. Next 50. Next 50.","The discussion touches on the topic of finance and the Indian economy. The speakers reminisce about the times when India was going through a balance of payment crisis and how Dr. Manmohan Singh changed the face of India with his policies. They mention how Singh's move to invite foreign exchange without any questions asked helped convert black money to white and solved India's foreign exchange problem. They discuss the importance of tackling the issue of black money and how it affects the lower-income group. The conversation also briefly touches on the speaker's plan to write a book on scams. In the end, they encourage the young listener to look ahead to an exciting future despite the scandals that will continue to happen."

What would you do today so that you can have a secure life in the future? And this is not only for me, it's for everyone in my. You see, everybody has to inculcate a culture of savings and investments. And for that, they must understand. According to me, knowledge is the most important thing. Because people, I keep advocating investing in stocks as national duty. Everyone should invest. But I also say at the same breadth that I'd rather you don't invest than invest foolishly. For the foolish person, you know, who gets it because he sees everyone making money, gets in foolishly. 99% is going to burn his fingers. But this kind of a guy comes out of stock exchange, cursing the stock exchange. Even though the fault was his, he said, this is a gambler's debt. This is no place to invest. And he's a dangerous person because this person not only never invests again, but he goes and dissuades 10, 20, 30 other people. You know, I made the mistake. These guys are dangerous. I feel the first prerequisite is knowledge. Correct. Even if you lose money, you've got to know why I lost because there's a lesson to be learned from everything. And if you take it as a lesson, then it'll probably help you. Because the best way to learn is by losing some money. Yeah. Maybe you lose a little money in the beginning and learn your lessons so that when the big money is involved, you know what went wrong. So everybody has to learn the culture of saving and investment. If your audience are the youngsters, which I think they would be, I saving habit should start as early as possible from your first paycheck onwards. Correct. I would you allocate it if you were there in today's generation. That depends on temperament, Shashank. I would not, you know, trust my views on anyone. It depends upon your risk. Risk appetite. Yeah. Because I feel it doesn't matter how attractive an investment it is underlying one principle. Remember if you make that investment and you don't sleep at night, you should not have made it. Smart. If you come to the equity market and if you think there's a risk, but you can stomach it, all means do it. So if you are risk averse, stay away from equity, but ideally learn the market. Partly you are scared. Your thinking is risky because you don't understand. So again, lack of knowledge, which is at fault. So you learn the ropes. Number one, first of all, with the moment a person starts earning, let's say above the tax-free limit, the earlier investments will have to be into tax saving investments. Correct. For a person who's on his own, one of the finest investments used to be today's less attractive, but still nice is a public provident fund account. I mean, if you take it as a retirement plan and make sure I keep investing in it till you retire or post that, not a short-term thing, because the power of compounding kicks in over there. Number two, everybody must understand insurance. Insurance is not investment, but almost everybody is underinsured or wrongly insured and not no fault of theirs because the people selling insurance are always selling you the wrong policies. They sell you policies where they make money, not necessarily which are good. And they keep telling you you'll get returns, which is not the case. You talk about returns in the context of insurance, you lost the... Insurance is not an investment. It is supposed to be for insuring yourselves. And therefore what makes the maximum sense is a term plan. Just direct life cover, nothing else. The next is the whole life policy. Or at least if it's an endowment policy, it should mature in your sixties. Sixties. So insurance, you've got to put some money aside. Tax saving investments among one of them I mentioned is a penny. Then you at the earliest start putting a little bit into equity and preferably pick up long-term stocks. So you can accumulate over the years. Compound again. Again, compounding kind of effect will happen to you. I am still in favor of a little bit of real estate. Even though financially it doesn't seem to make much sense, but I think in the long run, it will help. I think that's a problem that a lot of current youngsters have because you put 20% upfront down payment and then take the remaining 70-80% in debt. And then you have to pay this EMI, even though now housing rates are the lowest interest rates. But people don't like this. They get scared of the EMI concept right now, even though everyone's spending it. Everyone's spending it. So it depends upon each one's income pattern. If there is a consistency of income, they can do it. And I think at least one property one should have. And that also partially to balance your portfolio, even though financially it may not make much sense. But if you're taking it on housing loans, et cetera, and paying it through EMI and getting tax benefits, et cetera, et cetera. And in the long run, real estate has to go up. There's no two ways. The principle of demand supply says, the demand of land will always be there. The supply is not there at all. So eventually it has to go up. Right now it may be going through a little plateau or sometimes even falling. That's fine. Then one should go a little bit into liquid funds because for who knew a pandemic like this will come in? Emergency funds. Emergency funds have to be there. Then if people understand the principles of inflation and all that, then I hate gold otherwise. But gold from time to time makes sense. When you think it's becoming uncertain and everything is going weak, switch to gold, not physical, but in a demand format. And then keep switching back, you know, when things are improving. If you do that sensibly, there's a bit of money to be made over. So between equity, between a little bit of real estate, between tax saving, between insurance, between some whole bullion, whatever. And then come the other areas which are specialized, currency trading and stuff, which is not everyone's cup of tea. Wow. Wow. This is incredible. I think, yeah, I think, I think that's, I mean, I'm a little bit in euphoria of the 1992 era. I think that I should have been in that era, I think. More than taking advantage, because I look at everything that's happening in the market right now from one education perspective. I look at global markets also to connect the dots what's happening here. And then I see how I can take advantage. My final question is, you understand that knowledge, this is the knowledge. Now how can I take advantage of this? Okay, something's falling in China. How did, like, I mean, just to give an example, China, everything went bad. The chemical sector went really well here. Right. But again, how do you know that's a long-term thing? Maybe it'll all go back to being normal the way it worked. So a lot of questions, I mean, a lot of things that, which keep, I mean, again, thanks, I'm going to take you up on this offer of coming there and just sitting and understanding all the things that happened there, which couldn't be said on the podcast. So I'm getting more form on those things. But again, amazing, amazing, amazing, amazing, amazing.","The discussion covers the topic of finance, particularly on how to secure one's financial future through savings and investments. The speaker stresses that knowledge is crucial in making sound investment decisions, and that individuals should understand their risk appetite and choose investments accordingly. The speaker recommends starting with tax-saving investments and insurance, particularly term plans or whole life policies, and then investing in equity, preferably long-term stocks, and considering real estate as part of one's investment portfolio. The speaker acknowledges that real estate may not make sense financially, but it is a valuable asset to balance one's portfolio in the long run."
244,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNTNWQmf1DE_sep_0_245,zNTNWQmf1DE_sep_0_245,"You know, when I was in business school, the most horrible subject of all was accounting. You know, I was sound asleep in accounting course. And on top of that, I argued with the accounting teacher because the accounting teacher had no idea what accounting was. The guy was an idiot. So rich dad, poor dad is more appropriate today because if you read rich dad, poor dad, this is all it's about. It's about a financial statement. Income statement, balance sheet, statement of cash flow. How could it not be relevant when 99% of all people graduating from school don't even know what a financial statement is? And if they do, they probably had the same accounting teacher I had, Mr. Boring, who wasn't really an accountant. He had a master's in accountancy, but he had never been an accountant. So that's why I created the cash flow board game because accounting is the most important subject for individuals because this is what your banker wants to see. Your banker wants to see your financial statement. This is your report card when you leave school. If you have good financial statement, bankers will give you all the money you want. See, bankers have never asked me for my grades or my college I went through. I want to say this. You have this, they give you all the money you want. Find out really, really quickly the differences between what they're teaching in school and what we at Rich Dad teach. So this is the very big difference. Like I said, most school teachers are like my poor dad. And this was actually, this was Rich Dad Poor Dad, which you're seeing here as a financial statement. You know, Rich Dad Poor Dad is a book on accounting, the most boring subject on planet earth. Book number two of Rich Dad was this one here. And this was called the cash flow quadrant, right? You have E, S, B, and I. Test for you. What does E stand for? Employee. Good. And what do employees always say? That they work for money. But they want job security, paycheck, and pension. Yes. What does S stand for? Self-employed. They're small business owners. Yes. Doctors, lawyers. They work for tips. They work for tips. So they're self-employed. And B stands for what? Big business owners. So 500 employees or more. And I stands for what? The investor. Investor. It's more than just investor, it's insider. You see this is like Shark Tank on the TV shows. These guys here have done this and they've done this. So this was my poor dad, this side. This was Rich Dad here. So the difference that's what schools are not teaching you is what's the difference between these people and these people. That's the big difference. And that shows up so when I was about your age, I had to make a decision. Did I want to, I was a pilot. You know, most of my friends wanted to fly for the airlines. But I'd be here. Or I could be, you know, I could have a little, I could be an Alaska flying fisherman around the place, you know, a private, a pilot with a small plane and, you know, flying around the place. Or I could own an airline or I could invest in airlines. And that's the difference in the mindsets and skill sets. You don't just make crossings. The education is extremely different on this side than on this side here. And I know most millennials, they want a high paying job. They want to be able to pay the rent, eat and all this stuff. And then you dream of the big house and a nice car and all that. But that's why 99% of Americans are broke. Because their heads are on the wrong spot. So when I asked Kim if she would take an accounting course, which is two days.","The discussion touches on the importance of accounting and financial literacy, which is not taught well in schools. The speaker argues that understanding financial statements is crucial for individuals as it is what bankers use to determine creditworthiness. The speaker recommends reading ""Rich Dad, Poor Dad"" and playing the ""Cash Flow"" board game to learn about financial statements and the differences between the ""E"" (employees), ""S"" (self-employed), ""B"" (big business owners), and ""I"" (investors/insiders) quadrants. The speaker believes that most people focus on getting a high-paying job instead of investing, which is why they remain broke."

But I do remember the moment down the road where, just like everybody else, I was focused on the income column. Get a job, get the pay raises. If you're an hourly wage, work more hours or raise your hourly wage. So I was always focused here. And then finally, after we'd actually bought some investment properties, the light finally went on. And I'm like, instead of focusing on acquiring income, what if we focus on just acquiring assets, that the assets go into the income column? Like this. So that was a huge shift in my mindset. And once that shift happened for me, I don't think about the income column anymore. I just think about the asset column. And that's our game called cash flow. And so when Kim and I met, we had nothing. It took us 10 years to go from nothing to financially free. So she was 37 and I was 47. But that's the power of focusing on assets versus liability. Most people are so busy working for money, so busy trying to pay their bills, and so busy buying liabilities, I think, are assets. So my first gift to Kim was the counting game to get her head in here. And today we're financially free. And that's the whole thing. So everybody can do it. It's a matter of putting your head into the right column. And for me, it was in 73, I took my first real estate investment course here. I'm free. I lost my name, get made money back. But I never got out of the asset column. I mean, we're still practicing here every single day. I'm working on a new project right now in the asset column. It's gonna put a lot of cash flow into the income column because again, we're focusing on the asset column, not the income column. There's three kinds of money today that you guys gotta be aware of. One is God's money. And God's money is gold and silver. So this is silver, and this is gold. The reason I brought it is most people don't know what it looks like. And then there's government money, which is fiat currency, which is the dollar, the yen, the peso, the euro, the yuan. Fake. And everybody's working hard for it. It's like eating fake food or drinking fake water. That's why people are getting sick financially because they're working for fake money. Okay. And then there's fake assets, which was another part of the fake generation series. But the reason I brought this here is most people haven't seen it. This here is real silver, plata. That's what it looks like. And so in 1972, and this here is gold. Yeah. This is God's money. This is what God's money looks like. The reason I call it God's money is you can't fake it. You know, you can fake it with a fake ETF, like a gold ETF or a silver, which I don't touch because it smells as bad as the guys that printed that crap. You know what I mean? Jesus. But this is real money. So you look at this here. When I first started buying that, that was $1.40. Today, that's $16. And this here is auto, gold. And the reason we brought it in is most people haven't seen or touched. This is real. This is God's money. Why do I say it's God's money? Because it was here when the earth was created. And it'll be here when we're all dead and gone. When you're saving those fake dollars, this will still be here. Or those fake ETFs, or those fake stocks. So this here is called a grain box. These are, there's 500 of these little tubes like this. Wow. 500 coins in here. And this is one. Which is worth more? Which one's worth more? The gold. Yeah, this is worth more than all that. Now the reason I say this is because for your generation, this could be the biggest opportunity you'll ever see. I'm not making any commissions on this, though. Yeah, of course. But if you look at what happened with the fake central bank, see the purpose of the central bank or the Fed, or all the Japanese, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank, they pump out fake money. The purpose of central banks like the Fed is to protect the banks, not you. They're a criminal operation as far as I'm concerned. You're gonna find that most of my talks is about the Fed. So I would recommend you guys buy this stuff. Don't save money. Don't save government money, because they're corrupt as hell, as you know.","The discussion touches on the importance of focusing on acquiring assets instead of just income. The speaker shares their own experience of shifting their mindset towards acquiring assets and how it led them to financial freedom. They also talk about the importance of differentiating between real assets and fake assets, such as government money or fake ETFs. The speaker highlights the value of investing in God's money, such as gold and silver, as they are not fake and have a long history of holding value.

So in other words these kids leave with young people like you leave school thinking, oh if I know the right answers then there's no risk and it drives old guys like me crazy because everybody's talking about Millennials what's wrong with them? You know Millennials are the most highly in many ways the most highly educated generation in history. They have the cell phone they didn't get educated in school they got educated on social media on the cell phones. They know all the answers but they're afraid of doing anything. Yeah. You know the biggest complaint about my generation is Millennials know all the answers but they can't do anything. The reason they can't do anything is because you might hurt their somebody's feelings you might make a mistake you know this just keeps you guys just trapped in this little box here. Yeah. So that's one of the reasons I think Millennial money is such an important point here because if you're going to come into my world old guys world or the information age you've really got to understand what is risky and what is not risky and in my world if you play it safe that makes you stupid because if you don't take risks you don't get smarter. Yeah. You know so you may know the answer but you can't do anything. Yeah. And one of the best things I had is I went from I went to military school then I went to flight school. I had such great teachers you know all of them could fly you know so my flight instructor could fly. What a novel idea you know a flight instructor can fly but when I was in high school most of my teachers were terrified. They're all cowards you know job security don't make mistakes just memorize the right answer and you'll be safe and that's why most school teachers aren't rich. Yeah. And they teach that to your generation. Yeah and most of them are teaching us things that they don't do on a daily basis like we have entrepreneurship classes and they're not entrepreneurs you know so it's it's kind of frightening when you think we're relying on the school system and the fact that they're teaching us so the way to get through college right is practicing all the right answers taking the exam putting in all the right answers when in real life that's the last thing that will ever happen right. No like you talk about fake you know this is my book fake here fake money fake teachers fake assets the reason it's fake money fake teachers and fake assets it's because it all has to be fake you have to have fake teachers to understand fake money then you have to have fake assets to buy those stocks bonds and mutual funds fake assets but without fake teachers fake money you can't do it so that's why I love I love working with on these programs here because if you're going to be successful you've got to take some risk most of the young people your age today and a lot of them want to become entrepreneurs the problem with this you have to understand tax you say this is all over the world very little difference these guys pay 40% of their money in taxes so they make a thousand dollars they're going to spend $400 in taxes these guys that make a thousand dollars they're gonna pay 60% in tax so our schools are teaching entrepreneurship but they're not teaching them tax okay and because they're focusing on income over here it's 20% in tax so they make a thousand dollars only $200 goes to tax and these guys 0% so the reason financial education isn't working in our school systems is they're teaching financial education for these people and these people but to really become rich you have to focus on this side here and that's the difference of a rich dad and the financial and what they're teaching in school right now I'd rather be on this side this side is a lot harder but in the long run it's more fun for me on this side here it's it's harder but you're paying tax constantly so these guys here are saying tax to rich well these guys don't pay taxes and as strange as that may seem and I'm talking about legally this is all over the world so that's the big difference here one last thing which I think most millennials understand is you know in rich dad poor dad I wrote about Ray Kroc founder of McDonald's and he was teaching at the University of Texas the MBA program and Ray asked and most of the MBAs are going to come out here so Ray Kroc asked him he says what business is McDonald's in and everybody yelled and said no no no we know you're in hamburgers and Ray says no we're not I'm not at McDonald's is not hamburgers McDonald's is in the business of real estate over here so what you have McDonald's here and the money McDonald's makes buys the real estate and that is my formula this is rich dad I own real estate I don't hang out here I'm glad you guys are here right and we do our best to make sure you're educated and you have your own businesses and things like this here but really the formula I follow personally is McDonald's we have education company that buys real estate which means we make a lot of money pay zero taxes legally what the school teach you about money nothing you know balancing a checkbook I mean give me a break give me a break so they other part of me look at this financial statement up here that's what your banker wants to see your banker doesn't care about your grades banker doesn't care what school you went to I made so many people say oh my banker won't give me any money what because you don't have one of these and when you look at most of the politicians today they don't have one of these either the US government doesn't have one of these anymore they stopped doing this because of the US government the budget is so out of balance balance balance balance balance balance balance balance balance balance","The discussion covers several topics related to finance.

So the other part of it, when you look at this financial statement up here, that's what your banker wants to see. Your banker doesn't care about your grades. Banker doesn't care what school you went to. I meet so many people who say, oh my banker won't give me any money. This is because you don't have one of these. And when you look at most of the politicians today, they don't have one of these either. The US government doesn't have one of these anymore. They stopped doing this because the US government, the budget is so out of balance, they can't do anything. So that's why 22 years ago, in 1996, I created the Cash Flow Board Game. The purpose of this was so people could teach people what our school systems will never teach you. Never! Because they don't know it. Because evidence is now coming out that the school system was hijacked by the ultra-rich years and years ago to never teach people what I know, what my rich dad taught me. So that's why most of our political leaders are broke. They're poor people. You know, who makes the most of the politicians? They got paychecks for life, they get benefits for life, they got all this stuff, but they're doing a horrible job. So you're going to depend upon the government to take care of you. That's crazy. A lot of people don't like Trump. I understand why. But he really understands his stuff. I know because he's my friend. We wrote two books together. This is how the rich think. Even if you hate Trump, and Trump doesn't pay taxes, that's why he doesn't want to show you his tax returns. I mean, you've got to be crazy. So they'll never teach you this in school. There's a reason for it to keep you working harder and harder and harder. So we created this. This board game here, as you play it 100 times, your brain will change. People luminate, go before you.

So this book is the best from every self-made billionaire that I could find. Carl Icahn, I mean, I'm sitting down with this guy, he just made $2 billion in the last 18 months off a $30 million investment off Netflix. He sent an email or a tweet out about Apple saying it was undervalued. And two hours later, it was worth $17 billion more by a tweet. So the people I've got to hang with over the last three, four years have been, I've got a PhD in finance from the people controlling the world's finance. And what I've tried to do is, the reason I did that is make it simple, bring it so I could train anybody else. Because in this business, what you don't know will hurt you financially. So I want to know how to protect people and how to help people maximize. And that's why I did the book. It's incredible. And what I want to know is why we weren't taught these things growing up. Me too. Tell me. Right? If they were like, okay, Tony, we're giving you the key to the education system. And how would you apply, what teachings would you apply into about finances? Learning about this, how to generate wealth as opposed to trading time for money, but really leveraging it and investing in the right way. What would you start implementing? Well, the first thing you want to teach anybody, a child, a kid, anybody is that you'll never earn your way to freedom. You just don't. You look around and you see, you know, Kurt Schilling, if you remember from Boston Red Sox, he had $100 million a year. He's broke, bankrupt. I said, what made you the wealthiest man in the world? And he smiled and he said three things. He said, living in America, great opportunities, having good genes. I lived a long time. And he said, the last thing is compounded interest. And we all know about compound interest. But I give you an example of a book of this guy, Theodore Johnson, worked for UPS, never made more than 14,000 in income in his entire life in a year. And in old ages, it was $70 million. And how did he do it? All he did was he took a percentage of his income. His percentage was 20%. Now, his family said, you can't, we can't save any money. But he met a friend who said, if you pretend there's a tax and the tax just took the money away from you and you never see it, the money just comes out of your account and goes in an investment account, you'll be financially free. And so he was disciplined. He didn't look at it. It happened. $70 million by compounding. So people's mistake is, and kids don't know this, adults don't know this, that you won't earn your way there, but you can compound your way there. What I want to do is say, where do you put that money? That's a trick, right? That's a secret. Well, the first trick is actually doing it. Almost nobody does. The second trick is you really have to understand where you're going to get hurt because The fees. The fees are just destroy people. You have a little chapter about the fees. I was like, this is incredible. Isn't it wild? It's nuts. We lose so much money just on the fees. Well, just so people have an understanding, 96% of all mutual funds never match the market. I mean, they never beat the market. So I was just on a morning show this morning and Michael Bloomberg's one of his guys in the house, some of his money. This is the only industry I know of where people think they could be a doctor. They think they could be a financial planner. And I said to him, I said, well, look, the statistics, Warren Buffett taught me this. He said, Ray Dalio told me this. David Swenson, who took Yale from $1 billion to $24 billion in two decades. These are people telling me this. Nobody beats the market except a couple of unicorns that nobody has access to. And I said, I didn't say you're not one of them. But I said, here's the truth. 96% of mutual funds don't match the market. That means 4% succeed. Now, what are your chances of picking the right mutual fund? People don't know what they're doing. They put their money in a 401K, pick a mutual fund not knowing what it is. If you play blackjack and you and I play and you get two face cards and your inner idiot says hit me, I want to give one chance in a million. Well, you're ace. You have an 8% chance of winning. If you try to get a mutual fund, you got the 4% chance of winning. So what I show people is not only do you not get the result, thinking logically, if I hire someone else to do it, they'll do better than me. But in addition, you pay around 2,000% more than it's worth. Meaning you get the same exact product, the same stocks. If you own the index, right? You own a piece of all of America's best companies, say the Vanguard 500 index, 500 top companies, that costs 0.17%. Like less than two tenths of a percent versus the average mutual fund is 3.17. It's incredible. You compound it over time. But first, just hear that so you understand. It's like, the average car sold in America is a Honda Civic. It's $20,000. You can get the Honda Civic for $20,000, or you can pay $350,000. That's the difference between 0.17 and 3.17. But if you look at it over a period of like, how old are you? 31. 31, okay. So let's assume you and a couple buddies at 35 managed to put aside 100 grand. And you manage not to add any more money, but to grow it at 7% in spite of ups and downs in the market. And you're 65, how much money do you have? Well, if you paid 1% in fees over those 30 years, 100 grand became $574,000. Not bad for never adding another dime. If you had 3% in fees, had the same growth but 3% in fees, you now have $324,000. Almost half as much. A quarter million dollars, 77% less money. And you had the same return, it was just the fees. So the world, most people you ask them, what are your fees? They have no clue. Right. So I've created a site where people can go, they can type it in, you find exactly what your fees are and what you should be paying. And it's highway robbing. Where in the world would you pay 2,000% more for the same exact product? You can only do it because the financial industry makes things so opaque, so convoluted, and people feel overwhelmed. It's hard to understand. Very hard to understand. That's why I try to come in here and go, look, time to become the chess player, not the chess piece, player, not the chess piece.","Tony Robbins, a motivational speaker, and author discussed his book ""Money: Master the Game"" in an interview. He mentions his experience working with Paul Tudor Jones, one of the top 10 financial traders in history, and how he has learned from him. He also talks about his book that features interviews with 50 of the most brilliant financial people in the world, including Carl Icahn. Robbins aims to simplify financial concepts and make them accessible to the general public to help them protect and maximize their wealth. He emphasizes that people should understand the power of compound interest and save regularly. He also highlights the importance of understanding fees and investing in low-cost index funds as a way to avoid underperforming mutual funds. Robbins stresses that people need to understand finance to succeed in life and that teaching about it should start early in life."

They use all these big words, but when you know what's going on, you don't get screwed, and more importantly, you take advantage of the system instead of letting the system take advantage of you. Yeah, I like that. Now, you've coached some of the world's greatest athletes, former presidents, biggest CEOs. Who coaches you? I've had a lot of people asking me to ask you this question. Who mentors you, who coaches you today? I have always looked for people that were playing the game at a different level than I am, and or knew the road ahead. I always tell people anticipation is power. If you ever play a video game against a child, it's pretty disastrous, right? Maybe not for you, you're maybe a different generation, but for me, it's like, you know, it's not the kid is faster and smarter if they played this game before, like eight million times. So they know the first shot's here, the second shot's here, the third shot's there, and you're like reacting. So when you're reacting to things, you fail. So my mentors have been people over the years, different people. My earliest mentor was a man named Jim Rohn, he was a personal development speaker, just touched my life. Then I was involved in neuro-linguistic programming, NLP, when I was 21, 22, 23 years old, and became partners with a man named John Grinder, brilliant man, co-founder of that. But in my last couple decades, it's been people like Peter Goober, who owns the LA Dodgers, and owns the Golden State Warriors NBA team, and he's just brilliant, he's got 52 Academy Award nominations. So he's a mentor for me. Paul Tudor Jones, I coach, but also I'm coached by him, because we get to pitch and catch. And then I've got some people in my life that, like Steve Wynn is a dear friend of mine, most of Las Vegas. And these guys are all 18 years my senior, so they know the road ahead. And I'm able to learn from them in advance, and kind of anticipate things, and that to me is incredibly valuable. Yeah, very cool. Now, I wanna ask you how you personally handle a breakdown. I've been to your workshop, and incredible experience. Thank you. And you teach people how to overcome their fears, and how to handle breakdowns, but how do you personally deal with it, and do you even have any breakdowns? Yeah, they sent me a list of questions you had, just to kind of give me a peek, and that was one of the questions I was like, it's interesting. It's breakdowns, it's certainly not something I experienced, but it's not because I'm so talented, or so brilliant, or so fearless. It's just, you're like an athlete. You're an athlete, you're in shape, right? You're not gonna have a reaction in your body like somebody who doesn't take care of themselves. So, I don't believe in emotional intelligence. I think it's useful, but I'm more interested in emotional fitness. Because intelligence is a capability. Fitness is a state of readiness. If you are fit, you can take that demand right now, and you can deal with it. You can deal with that physical stress, that emotional stress. Same thing's true with psychological fitness, emotional fitness, right? So, I'm pretty fit, and part of that is not because I'm so smart, part of it is that I've taught this for decades. I remember I had a woman who came to one of my seminars in, I don't know, early 80s probably, and she would run in this room, five, 10,000 people, I think it was, you know, she went to a couple of 10,000 person events, and she would get in this front row, fight her way through there, and she'd jump and go for it. At one break, she came up to me, I was signing a book for her, and she says, she goes, Mr. Robinson, I've seen you at like eight of these. I've seen you like when you're really, I know, I can hear your voice, you're hurting, or you haven't slept, and she goes, you always seem to be so up all the time. How come you're so up? And I said, well, part of it is I attend all these seminars. So, I'm teaching it. So, there's a fitness in that, but there's also, you know, I've buried three fathers in one mother, and you know, that affects your life. I've had a physician look me in the eye and say you have a tumor in your brain, and so I've had those moments that, when you've had extreme stress, and you push your way through it, you build psychological muscle. It's like it takes a lot to knock me off. You know, in the early days, we didn't have $50,000 to keep the doors open. How do we do it? Then I graduated to five million, then I graduated to a partner of mine who kind of didn't do things well, and I ended up owning $100 million because I had to take on his debts. $100 million. But when you do all that stuff, now my company's due five billion a year, so you keep expanding what I would call really the circle of your, the threshold of your influence. Everybody has a threshold of control, and if you get beyond it, you kind of freak out. So it takes a little bit more. I don't have to get into these. So you don't have break downs. I don't have a breakdown. Do I get pissed off or get frustrated or tired? Yeah, but a breakdown, honestly, no. So how do you handle it if you get tired or something? I sleep. When I can. I mean, it's honest, it's pretty simple. But you know, when I've had challenging times, I mean, I have so many tools. Yeah. You know, I pull them out. So it's like you as an athlete. You know, you don't just physically break down. Right. You take care of yourself. So I think most people don't train their mind and emotions. It's like, I think the most powerful muscles to me are not physical, they're as strong and as important as they are. It's like faith is a muscle, courage is a muscle, determination is a muscle, playfulness is a muscle. You know, passion unexpressed weakens. You know, faith untested gets smaller. So I'm always, I call it deep practice. I'm always pushing myself to the edge and pushing yourself to the edge makes you stronger. Yeah. In the book, I was really excited to hear you talk about, you say the secret to wealth is gratitude. Somewhere in the book it says that. And I think maybe it was someone else you were referencing. Yes, it came from Sir John Templeton. And every day I practice gratitude. When I wake up and every night, I always try to say to my girlfriend or someone I'm talking to before I go to sleep, three things I'm most grateful for. That's great. Now why, so I was pleased to see that. I was like, I'm on the right track if I'm looking at gratitude, but why is that the secret to wealth? Well, Sir John Templeton is probably one of the greatest investors in history. People don't know his name. He started out with nothing. He wasn't Sir, he wasn't from another country, he came from the US. And he decided that he wanted to understand wealth. And so he saved $10,000, a huge amount of money in those days. And when Hitler invaded Poland, he developed a belief. His belief was you make your money in times of maximum pessimism. Like if you were around in 2008, 2009, you remember what it was like, right? You could have bought the Sands in Las Vegas, you could have bought their stock for $2.28. Today it's $67. It's a 3000% return. It's not bad. You could have bought Citibank for less than a buck.","In this interview, Tony Robbins discusses the importance of understanding finance, having mentors, and being emotionally fit. He emphasizes the need to take advantage of the system instead of letting it take advantage of you. His mentors include successful individuals such as Peter Goober and Steve Wynn. Robbins also discusses how he handles breakdowns, stating that he focuses on emotional fitness and building psychological muscle through experiencing extreme stress and pushing through it. He mentions his company's growth from struggling to keep the doors open with $50,000 to now making $5 billion a year."

And so what he did was, and everybody thought the world was gonna end, he took $10,000, he bought every stock on New York Stock Exchange, it was a dollar or less, including companies everybody thought were going bankrupt. But when things are bad, people think it's gonna be bad forever. When things are good, they think it's gonna be good forever. And they're always wrong, life's cyclical. So there's a season for everything. So once we got through World War II and went a few years later, guess what? Those same stocks made him a billionaire. So when I asked him, I said, what's the secret to wealth? He's responsibly touched me, he goes, you know it, you teach it. I said, what's that? He said, gratitude. And I said, why do you say that? He said, because if you got a billion dollars and every day you live pissed off and frustrated, the quality of your life is called pissed off and frustrated. But if you have nothing, but you're euphorically grateful for whatever you have, you're the richest person that you're gonna know. He said, so it doesn't matter how much money you got if you don't have gratitude. So I do the same thing, by the way. I have a process I call priming, where I get up every morning, I do mine in the morning, I just radical change to my body, kind of alter my state. And then I do 10 minutes I never miss, and my first three and a half minutes is what I'm really grateful for. And I make myself think of at least one of those three that's something really simplistic, instead of something giant. You know, the wind on my face, the look in one of my kids' eyes, you know, something of that nature. And then I do three minutes of strength and healing, and then I do three minutes of when I'm gonna create my world, and I do that for a minimum of 10 minutes every day, because I believe you have to condition it. You don't just hope that stuff shows up. You set your intention each morning. Well, I don't know, every day. Yeah, very cool. So what are you most grateful for recently in your life? So many things. Well, it's Thanksgiving, so one piece, well, one is my daughter is 40 years old, and she's been with me in the child forever, and she's gonna bring me a grand son. Wow, congratulations. Thank you very much. That's cool. But also it's Thanksgiving, so for me, it's a very emotional time, because my family was fed when I was 11, we had no food at Thanksgiving, and it touched me so deeply, and I decided I was gonna get back, so when I was 17, I fed two families, and then four, and then eight, and then I didn't tell anybody I was doing it, and then I got my friends to do it, and my companies grew, and I've fed 42 million people now over 37 years, and what I've been doing. But you have a challenge for this, right? 100 million. Well, this one, what I did is I decided, I'm writing this book, and in the middle of writing it, last summer, most people didn't even notice, Congress cut food stamps, they don't call them food stamps anymore, but I lived on them, so I know what they are, food stamps, but my family lived on them, but they cut it by 8.7 billion, which means you eliminate two million people from the rolls overnight, and they still need to eat. So I support all these nonprofit organizations, and Feeding America's the largest in the country, and so I thought, I wanna call attention to this, so if I donated all the profits of this book in advance, how many people could I feed? Because I normally feed two million through my foundation, and I match it, so I feed four million a year. And they said you could feed 10 million people. I was like, wow. I mean, and then as the years gone by, I've gotten more and more inspired, and so now I'm gonna feed 50 million people personally, and not just from the book, I'm writing a larger check on top of it, but also I'm working with Feeding America to get matching funds to feed 100 million people. So to go from my family not being able to eat to feeding 100 million people is a pretty amazing sense of gratitude and a sense of grace, and I've done my part, but there's been grace in that as well. That's amazing, it's incredible what you're doing, and very inspiring, so thank you for doing that. So anybody that gets the book, I'm not giving it to the prominents for you, but it also feeds an average 50 families every book. 100% is being donated. 100%. Not only 100%, more than 100%. That's amazing. Now, I think I also read in the book, I don't know if you said this or someone else said this, but the key to living is giving. Yes. Now, I think I might have heard you say this actually back when I first saw you when I was 16 at an event, and I remember thinking, I don't have anything to give. I don't have any money, how am I supposed to invest my money? 10, 20% every month, and then how can I give on top of that? But I really understood that it's so valuable and important to give, and I work with a lot of nonprofits myself, building schools for kids around the world, and I've seen a big impact in my life in the way I'm able to serve people. Sir John Templeton told me that he's never seen anyone tithe, which tithing is usually 10% of what you earn, for at least a decade. He didn't become incredibly financially free. And I think the reason is, I had a moment when my whole life changed. It was kind of two-fold. I was really young like yourself back then, working my tail off, trying to build a business, and you have big goals, you don't always succeed to start with, you just come together. It was hard. And I remember I was so frustrated because I was working 18-hour days, and nothing was working, and I was broke, and I felt embarrassed, you know, I should be doing better than this. And so I was driving home from Orange County on the 57th freeway in St. Gabriel Valley, out near a place, Pomona, California, probably doesn't know anybody else, but I can remember it so vividly, because it was almost midnight, and I was at this breaking point, and then I was like, why am I not doing better? And then I just pulled over the road, and I used to keep these journals, I still have them, written journals, and I wrote in big lines, you know, the secret to living is giving. And I started to cry. And I realized, I am so focused on what am I not getting, I'm not focusing on what I'm giving. So for six months, man, it turned me around. But then, you know, something else I get in your body, it was in my head, it was in my heart, but I had to get in there to stay. And I started going through some really tough times, and I lost everything financially, and I was mad at everybody, because I loaned a friend a thousand bucks, and you know, I had them doing well, and you know, I didn't even return my phone call. And what changed me was, I was down to, I don't know, 22, 23 bucks, something like that, and it was $24. Enough that I knew that I didn't have money for food for the next week, clearly. And I didn't have any prospects. And I was living in Venice, in this 400 square foot bachelor apartment, feeling sorry for myself, I'm getting pissed off. And I thought, you know what, I gotta eat. So I'm not gonna drive my car, because I'm not gonna spend the gas, I'm not gonna pay for parking. I'm gonna go to an all-you-can-eat place, and load up for the winter, right? So I can get more, like one meal a day. And so, there's a place called Marina Del Rey, not far from Venice, and it's a beautiful community, and it's right on the water. And there's a place called El Trito, it's still there. It's a little restaurant, it had taco, bar, and all that kind of stuff. So I walked there for the three miles, and I go, I'm gonna go and load up. And I was all about myself, and getting through this. And this little, this woman walked through Dorian and Verichai, Dorian and Verichai, Dorian and Verichai, Dorian and Verichai, Dorian and Verichai, Dorian and Verichai, Dorian and Verichai, Dorian and Verichai, Dorian and Verichai.","In a recent interview, Tony Robbins shared the story of his mentor, who turned $10,000 into billions of dollars by buying stocks that were trading for a dollar or less on the New York Stock Exchange, including those of companies that everyone thought were going bankrupt during the Great Depression. His mentor attributed his success to gratitude, saying that no matter how much money one has, without gratitude, life will be filled with frustration and unhappiness. Tony Robbins practices this concept of gratitude daily through his morning ritual of priming, where he spends three and a half minutes thinking of things he is grateful for, followed by three minutes of strength and healing and three minutes of creating his world. He is donating all the profits of his book to Feeding America, with the goal of feeding 100 million people. He believes that the key to living is giving, and no matter how little one has, everyone can give something."

He opens the door for her, he pulls out the chair for her, and it was just, he stared in his mother's eyes, I mean, it was just pierced into her eyes. I don't know what it was, but something about him was just so moving, he was such a sweet, caring, loving young man to his mother that moved me. So I paid for my meal, I don't know what was left, 17, 18 bucks, put it back in my pocket, it was left, walked up to this young man, I introduced myself, and I said, hi, I don't remember his name, I think his name was Ronnie, and I said Ronnie, I said, you're really, I said, you're a class actor, I saw you open the door for your lady, I saw you hold out the chair for your lady, he goes, she's my mom. I said, that's even more classy. And I said, so cool that you're taking her out to lunch like this, and he goes, I'm not really taking her to lunch, because I'm just 11, and I don't have a job, you know. I said, yes, you are, and I had no plan, and literally, I just reached in my pocket, took all the money he had, changed all the bills, and threw it right there in front of him. You look at me like this, he goes, I can't take that. I said, sure you can, he said, well, why? Because I'm bigger than you are. And he got this big grin in his face, his eyes got this big, and I just shook his hand, I didn't even look at his mom, and I just walked out the door, but the reason to tell you the story is, I had no car, I had no money, I was euphoric, I was like flying home, I was like, I'd probably look like an idiot, probably skipping or something, I mean, I was just, and what I felt was, I should have been like, what the hell did you just do, I have no meal, what are we gonna eat? I went home that night, I laid out a plan, and the plan was gonna take me 10 days, two weeks, so I thought, well, people fast for a week, I could fast for a week, you know, that kind of thing, and I had this great mindset about it, and I woke up the next morning, and I get the old regular snail mail shows up, and it's this guy I've called a zillion times, he wouldn't return my call, I open it up, there's a check, thousand bucks, plus interest, and an apology, so I'm sitting there, and I started to cry, honestly, and I was just like, why did this happen, you know? And I don't know if it's true, but I decided that day, this happened because I did the right thing, because I didn't have a plan, it wasn't a strategy, I just felt this little soul beside me, I knew it was right, and I did it, and I didn't do it because I thought I could or I couldn't, I didn't even think about it, and that's the day I became a wealthy man, because I didn't have any money, but scarcity left my body, and I had plenty of ups and downs since that time, and various times in my life, but I never went back to that, oh my God, how's it gonna happen, it's like breathing, do you stop and say, God, is there gonna be any air before you take a breath? You know it's gonna be there, you don't run your life by that aspect, and so that to me is what it's about, is showing people, if you won't give a dime out of a dollar, don't bullshit yourself, you'll never give a million out of 10 million or 10 million out of 100 million, it's just not gonna happen, but if you can do that now, you don't ever get beyond scarcity, you start behind it, you make a decision to get beyond it. So how does someone, you know, when they're living in scarcity, they're living in fear, and it's like this emotional feeling, it's in your body, like you say, when you're like, I can't even pay for my meal, how am I gonna like start giving? What are some things that people can do to start overcoming that mindset, or start strengthening it or shifting it? So that they're not living. I'll tell you what I did when I was first on my own, you know, I got, my dad, my mom kicked my dad out when I was 17, she's a very powerful woman, I have four fathers, so they all learned how to get the boot, she thought I was on his side, so she kicked me out next, I was 17, she chased me out with a knife, she wouldn't have hurt me, but I wasn't going back in the room, and that's how I figured out what to do, and I didn't play stay, and I was staying in somebody's laundry room for a while, and I started reading and feeding my mind, and then I developed this little system, and the system was really simple, and I tell people that, as I say, number one, every single day, you gotta feed and strengthen your mind. Until you do that, you're always gonna be in fear, because fear's automatic, the human brain is designed for survival, it's not designed for success, your brain is not designed to make you happy, that's your job, and the only way you're gonna do it is if you feed your mind, because otherwise, weeds grow automatically, my coach, my mentor, Jim Roney used to tell me, he said, Tony, every day you gotta stand guard at the door of your mind, you gotta watch what's going in, because if you're not careful, stuff will go in, and he said, in all of times, there's somebody who cares about you, he said, you know, if you're- Your family. Yeah, if your worst enemy puts sugar in your coffee, he said, what happens? I said, you got sweet coffee, he goes, what if your best friend by accident, or your family, don't mean to, they drop one drop of strychnine in your coffee, you're dead, he said, so life's sugar and strychnine and watch your coffee. So every day, I decided, I'm old enough, honestly, there was no internet those days, I'm pretty ancient, I used to go to the library, because it was the only place you could go, and I would read biographies, I'd read people's lives, and it'd make me go, wait a second, as bad as I think it is, the greatest people in the world had it worse, so there's something here. So you feed your mind, Jim Rohn used to say to me, skip a meal, but don't skip reading, he said, read 30 minutes a day, I don't give a damn what it is, and today, I don't mean internet crap, I mean, read something, a biography, read something that's a strategy, read something that's gonna change your life. And the second thing I tell people is, feeding your mind's great, but you gotta also strengthen your body, and you do that as an athlete, naturally, I learned to do that, because fear is physical, right? You know where you feel it, and if you go work out, if you go lift, if you go run, even if you're out of shape, you just go for an intense walk, that experience alone changes your life. Every day in my life, the first thing I do before I do my priming, if I'm at one of my homes, I jump in some hot water for fun, and then I jump in freezing water, and I have a river, I'm at one of my homes in Sun Valley, and I've got cold punches everywhere, cold punches everywhere, cold punches everywhere, cold punches everywhere, cold punches everywhere, cold punches everywhere, cold punches everywhere,","The discussion revolves around the topic of scarcity and how to overcome it. Tony Robbins shares a personal anecdote about how he once paid for a meal for a young man and his mother, which left him with no money to pay for his own meal. However, he believed that doing the right thing would bring him wealth, and he received a check for $1,000 plus interest the next day. He then discusses how scarcity can hold people back from giving and becoming wealthy, and he advises people to start with small acts of giving and to feed and strengthen their minds every day to overcome scarcity. He shares a simple system that helped him when he was starting out, which involves feeding the mind, taking action, and measuring progress."

You talk a lot about that, but what would you do if you're making... Knowing what I know today? Yeah, go back, you're 31 years old, what would you be doing? Three things you'd do first. Well, you have a good income, so we're talking about you. Yeah, sure, so you're making six to seven figures. Great, that's wonderful. So what I would do in that range is I would take and I would model one of the best masters. If it was me, one of the people, asset allocation, some people are clear, is the one thing that I met with David Swenson. He took one billion, turned it into 24 billion in two decades, in 20 years. Just mind boggling, a billion a year, right? Just think about that double doubling. It's just mind boggling. And I asked him, I said, what are the dials? What are the only dials we can touch? And he said, Tony, to increase your return, there's only a few things you can do. He said, you can make better selections of stocks. He said, you can have better timing. He said, and you can have better asset allocation. He said, the first two will never happen, because the first two cost you money. Gotta hire somebody, everybody's wrong in the timing. He said, asset allocation, which simply means dividing your money into different buckets. Some of those buckets are secure, so that even though you think you're gonna be a genius, you're gonna make money no matter what, that money grows slower, but it'll always be there, and it'll give you freedom for the rest of your life. There's a growth bucket, which is also a risk bucket. We forget that, because one of the things Ray Dalio taught me, he said, Tony, everybody invests in what they think they know. You grew up with real estate, you're not a genius, you made money in real estate, because anybody can when real estate's growing up. You think you're a genius. You think you know stocks. Oh, you're a genius in 1999, right? You're a genius in 2010, when things started to grow. He said, whatever you invest in, in your lifetime, that area is gonna drop 50 to 70%. There is zero exception. He showed you mathematically, and he could show you historically. So he said, you have to diversify, even though you don't want to, and you have to divide these monies up. So every one of them taught me different asset allocations, but the one that I think is the most valuable for anybody to really take advantage of is Ray Dalio's, because Ray Dalio's figured out, why is it in 2008, if your stockbroker, your financial planner said, we're gonna protect you, we're gonna put you half in stocks and half in bonds, why did they both go down? You weren't protected at all, same thing happened in 2000. And he figured something out. When you think you're in a balanced portfolio, you're not balanced, and the reason is, stocks are three times more volatile than you'll find in bonds. What does that mean? It means when you think you're 50-50, you're 50-50 with your money, but you're not 50-50 with your risk. You're 95% at risk and 5% on the good side. That's where everybody loses. So he figured a formula, because he said, look, someday I'm gonna be gone. I want my kids to have the money long-term. I want all the philanthropic things I'm doing to be taken care of. So he spent 15 years studying the markets and figured out, how do I design a portfolio that'll make money every time? If it loses money, it lost in 75 years, it's lost 1.6% when it's lost, but it's been right 85% of the time. If you went to Vegas, if you went to work for 75 years, it made money 85% of the time, and when you lost, you lost 1.6%, and when you gained, you gained more than 10%. The biggest loss in 75 years was 3.95%, less than four. So why did people not make it in the stock market? Because when you take a 50% hit, they all say, stay in. Nobody, the average person never stays in. If you look at the last 20 years, the average person, the stock market over 20 years, from 1993 to 2013, has averaged 9.2%. Pretty cool compounding. You double your money pretty damn quick doing that. But the average mutual fund investors made 2.5%. Why? Because they freak out, they sell when it goes down, they buy when it's looking good, it's just the wrong time to buy it. They don't know what to do. So what Ray Dalio's strategy does, and by the way, he's never shared this strategy ever publicly. And he gives it in here. He gives it in here, which is mind boggling. I pushed him, I teased him, I controlled him. In the end, I said, look, you're not taking any more money, help the average guy out. He lays it out, you can do it yourself, or you can have someone else do it for you. But it takes 15 minutes a year, and 85% success over 75 years. And then I could take any time period, last 30 years. You lost money four times. One of those is .003%, so it's really breaking. And again, the most you ever lost, less than 4%, average 1.9%. So if you're looking for a plan, I put some money there. Then the other money that I would do is I'd take some of the money and I'd look at what are the biggest trends. I have a lot of my money also in senior housing. And the reason is twofold. It's a demographic inevitability. There's this giant wave of baby boomers, and there isn't enough senior housing to take care of them. And I also, I like it. I like to create a quality place for someone to be able to be lived and taken care of and so forth. But there's huge income from it, and there's the growth in the asset itself. So I'd be looking at what are the big trends, but I would make sure I walked down a segment of my money that just, I took a percentage of my income no matter what. And I made it really big, and I made it so I never have to work again. And that's where I am now. I don't have to work. And what's ironic is when you interview people that make at least 750,000 a year, right? Just under a million, 80% of them say they'll never retire. When you interview people that make a very little amount of money, they all talk about wanting to retire. And the people that do retire say they'll retire after 75. Like, Steve Williams, my buddy, is 72, Warren Buffett's 80 foot four now. Still, still, still, still, still, still, still, still, still, still, still, still, still, still, still, still, still, still, still, still, still, still, still, still, still.","The discussion centers around finance, specifically how to invest money for someone with a good income, making six to seven figures. The conversation focuses on asset allocation, which means dividing your money into different buckets, including secure and growth buckets. The key takeaway is to diversify your portfolio and divide money among different buckets to protect against market volatility. The conversation also discusses Ray Dalio's investment strategy, which involves designing a portfolio that makes money every time and has only lost 1.6% in the last 75 years. Finally, the conversation touches on the importance of having a fiduciary to help manage investments and avoid making costly mistakes due to emotions."

We already spoke about it last week, but this week, we, I had the great honor and privilege of sitting down with Guy Spear, of course, the managing partner of the Aquamarine Fund. He's also written the Education of Value Investor, very good book. I recommend you guys should definitely read it. He is very, he's got a great story, a really interesting story. I don't focus too much about his story. That's what his book's more for, but it's a great story. And yeah, it was so cool. You always wonder like, when you meet these guys that you see on, you know, YouTube or you see on CNBC or whatever, like are they gonna be the, like the same, when I talk to them off camera, they're gonna be the same person that they are like on camera, because Guy on camera, he's such a nice guy. He's got time for everyone he really cares. And I can absolutely tell you that yes, he is the same guy on and off camera. It was just amazing. We spoke for like an hour before we even pressed record to record this podcast. It was unreal. Yeah, and he was so interested, you know, he just showed an interest in what we were doing over here. It was just, it was a great experience. Very, very happy that I got the chance to speak with him and very excited that I get to bring you, I think it's like 45 minutes worth of podcast. Fantastic. It's like me just having a yarn chewing the ear off of Guy's spear. That's great. Give us a couple of quick headlines of what was done in the interview. What did you talk about? Like just quick headlines. Oh, well, we spoke about passive investing. We spoke about investing during the current macro environment as well. We spoke about how new investors should approach the markets at a time like this. And then I also spoke about, he's got things like his own personal investing checklist and things that he's changed to that over time and the structure, the way he structures his investing environment. We spoke about that as well, because he's very big on like get your environment right so that you're not kind of, you know, pulled in this direction or that by the noise and the fear uncertainty, doubt, the fear of missing out, that kind of stuff. So spoke a lot about that. So overall, with that said, it is a very, very cool, I should stop just talking about the fact that it happened and just play the flip and things. So with that said, please enjoy the next 45 minutes. This is my chat with Mr. Guy Spear. All right, guys, well, my guest today is an Avid Buffett style investor who started the Aqua Marine Fund back in 1997. From that time up until the end of 2021, he achieved a total return of 938.9% versus just 690% for the S&P 500. He's also an author, having published the Education of a Value Investor back in 2014 and sold over 50,000 copies in English alone. He's also known for teaming up with Monish Pribri in 2007 and placing the winning bid for a charity lunch with Warren Buffett himself. My guest today is of course Guy Spear. Guy, it's an absolute honor to have you on the podcast and on the YouTube channel as well. So firstly, I just wanted to say a very big thank you for taking the time out of your day to come and share, not only come and share,","In this podcast, the host interviews Guy Spear, the managing partner of Aquamarine Fund and a well-known value investor.

254,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-XZUvYcrzE_sep_278_602,R-XZUvYcrzE_sep_278_602,"to know because a lot of the followers of my channel are pretty new to investing. They're looking to get started out and obviously there's been a lot of investors looking to get started with investing right now, especially after 2022. It brought many businesses kind of back down to earth but at the same time people are very hesitant to get started with all the fear and noise they hear around the macroeconomic environment. So I was just wondering, drawing from your obviously decades of experience, I'm interested to hear what advice would you give to new investors at a time like this? How do you advise they kind of get started with their investing? I mean yeah in a certain way if you're a new investor, if you didn't lose any money in 2022, if you weren't part of the crypto bubble let's say, then you're in an amazing place because you're kind of starting from scratch. So I just want to encourage you and I would also tell you that let's say that you're somebody who got caught up in, you look back on the last few years and decide that you invested far more or too much of your say investable funds into say crypto or something that was riding high but is now down a lot. What you don't want to do is you don't want to compound those mistakes and so if you try something once, which is a good thing if you do it a hundred times but you only try it once and then you stop, then even if the first time it didn't work out it would be a terrible thing to stop after just one try. We don't, if we're watching our children learn to walk, we don't watch them fall over once and then say oh that you know give that a break and so or just to give another analogy if that's okay Brandon, if we think of exercise what I've learned or I'm still learning is that the key to becoming fit is not so much about trying hard on your first workout or even your tenth workout, it's turning yourself into somebody who regularly works out and so what I've learned at my Rye page is that what I need to do is reward myself after every workout. If I reward myself after every workout, don't bother about whether I run half a kilometer, 10 kilometers, if I push myself, I don't push myself, give myself a nice reward because that will get that consistency going. So in a certain way investing is the same way. This is not about taking the plunge, this is not about what happened last year, this is not about, it's about becoming a person who's an investor and if we just go to Warren Buffett whom you mentioned, I mean every month, every year Berkshire Hathaway is buying pieces of America, is buying shares, every month there's share purchases taking place and so we should become more like that. And what do you say to people who are particularly hesitant specifically because of say the macroeconomic environment? I mean should somebody that's interested in getting started with investing or value investing, Buffett style investing, should they be paying attention to macroeconomics? Does it play a role in your investing or should it just be, do you think it's better if it's just blocked out from the decision making process? Well there's a very easy and simple answer to that Brandon which is you absolutely should block it out and just forget that it was even there and just realize that macroeconomics is important from a macro perspective. The people who run the country or the people who run the global economy do take important decisions. It's not a bad thing that newspapers cover it because decisions on say interest rates or you know a country like the UK leaving the European Union or the World Trade Organization or a thousand different issues really do affect how the world economy develops but we're operating on the scale of our own personal savings or the savings of us and our investors and we're operating on at a completely different scale where it kind of doesn't matter for us. What we're trying to do is we're trying to own a piece of the productive economy and maybe another way of looking at it is if you're a mouse or if you're an ant walking around amongst elephants you absolutely care where the elephants are you know and you care where they step and all of those things but at the end of the day you know what you need to do is you need to work on building your nest you need to work on gathering food and it's just on such a different scale that it's not going to affect what you need to do on a daily basis and you shouldn't allow in that analogy the movements of the elephants to affect what is your daily task which is to say own a slightly larger proportion of the world's productive assets at the end of the day. So if there are people who really hesitate and look it is a natural thing to be hesitant it's natural thing to be fearful so I think that my words to that person is don't deny your feelings don't don't don't don't don't","The discussion is about giving advice to new investors on how to get started with investing in the current macroeconomic environment. The speaker encourages new investors to start investing and not to compound their past mistakes. He suggests that the key to becoming a successful investor is to become a person who regularly invests rather than taking the plunge. The discussion also touches on the role of macroeconomics in investing, with the speaker advising investors to block out macroeconomic noise and focus on owning a piece of the productive economy. The speaker acknowledges that it is natural to be hesitant and fearful, but encourages investors not to deny their feelings and to keep investing consistently."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-XZUvYcrzE_sep_750_1100,R-XZUvYcrzE_sep_750_1100,"That's one of the talking about kind of detaching or acknowledging your emotions, detaching from them and making rational decisions. Obviously, there's a massive focus in your book, The Education of a Family Investor, on getting your investment mind, your environment right, your structure right. You write a great line which says, it's critical for investors to structure their environment to counter their mental weaknesses, idiosyncrasies and irrational tendencies. My question to you is, for maybe new investors, what are some practical steps that everyday investors can implement to make sure that they don't succumb to these kind of destructive mental patterns? You know, they could spend more time watching your YouTube channel. And that's not, I say that slightly because it's fun to promote Brandon on his own channel. But also because it's, I think it's a whole bunch of little steps, you know. And the stories that get written, all the little steps are kind of boring. So we don't read about them in stories because stories are written in a way to grab our attention because otherwise they won't get read or they won't get seen or watched. But reality, God is in the detail. So I think that there are a thousand different steps that one can take to build that environment. And yeah, tuning into the right YouTube channels is one of them. The other thought that came straight into my mind because this was part of the discussion that we had before we came live was come to the Berkshire meetings. It's a long way to go if you're in Australia. But you sort of say, well, why should I go to the Berkshire Hathaway meeting? I can do everything from, I can watch it all online. But at the Berkshire Hathaway meeting, the minute you board the plane to Omaha, you're going to start meeting people. And then when you're in Omaha, you're going to meet more people. And those people form, they're kind of all these, there's a beautiful idea in the Talmud, which is a sort of a Jewish text, which is that the Sabbath is mountains held up by threads, mountain ranges held up by threads. There's all these sort of like small rules that kind of help, in this case, helps the Jewish people keep the Sabbath. And I think that there's a powerful analogy. So there's no one thing that's going to solve the problem, if you like. There's no one great big hammer that you smash down on the nail and now you're done. It's kind of a process of constantly weaving, constantly creating, constantly thinking, how can I improve? And one of the things I've learned since the book, in the book, I talk a lot about the physical environment, talk about how to set up my desk, my office, living in Zurich, all of those things. What I realize now is that while those things aren't terrible things to focus on, but far more powerful levers to pull are who you have in your life. Who do you choose to have as your closest relationships? And what I would say there is that this doesn't have to be, you don't have to call up a good friend one day and say, hey, I don't want you in my life because you don't think the way I want to think myself and therefore I've got to push you out. It's just about drawing the people who do think in the right way just a little bit closer, which is part of the sort of like Berkshire Hathaway idea, going to the Berkshire Hathaway meeting. I organized a conference really in part to help me with my environment. So I sort of said to myself, how do I bring more value investors to Zurich? And I said, well, I love skiing. So why don't I invite all the people I'd love to see to a ski trip? And so, you know, a group gets together in the mountains. But so there are lots of small ideas, but no one big idea is going to do it. Definitely sounds as though the main takeaway is to, yes, try and immerse yourself or surround yourself with the people that think along that long term rational investing kind of mindset. Yeah. And, you know, I'll give you a very brief or a preview of a section of my letter to investors that we're just sort of like editing the final. When does that come out? We'll see. It'll go out to our investors first. And I'm allowed to share it with the public now, I believe. So it will, you know, in the next week or two or three, probably not the next week, but two or three weeks, it'll come out. Right. And in that, I asked the question, well, how did I avoid the kind of like the tech, the tech crash that happened last year? And my point to the reader is that it's not as if I'm some genius who was able to avoid it. And I think you probably read a lot of letters and the people who did avoid it that well, that who will I don't think that all of us can succumb to the kind of thing that people succumb to over the last few years and myself included, Warren Buffett included. And so, you know, we need to build fences around ourselves. We need to build the fences in the right place that lead us in a good direction, not a bad direction, if you like. And I think that just, you know, everything's one Charlie Munger said, everything's one damned interconnectedness after another. And pretty much everything that we do, you know, there's a there's an element where we could look at it and say, well, does this lead me closer to a path of intelligent investing or further away? And if it leads you closer than do it, and if it leads you further away, then maybe you should consider not doing it. And so I haven't I've given you a non-answer to the question, but I think it's a I think it's a good I we could dive into specific details of what one what one might do. I mean, the only the one that I've given you is attending the books, attending the books, attending the books, attending the books, attending the books.","The discussion is about the practical steps everyday investors can take to avoid succumbing to destructive mental patterns while investing. The guest suggests that investors should structure their environment to counter their mental weaknesses, idiosyncrasies, and irrational tendencies. He believes that small steps, such as tuning into the right YouTube channels or attending conferences like the Berkshire Hathaway meeting, can help. However, the guest argues that the most powerful levers to pull are who you have in your life and advises investors to surround themselves with people who think along the long-term rational investing mindset. Finally, he shares that he avoided the tech crash by building fences around himself and suggests that investors should build the fences in the right place to lead them in a good direction."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-XZUvYcrzE_sep_1105_1440,R-XZUvYcrzE_sep_1105_1440,"And I think another big point that I took away from reading your book is, I think chapter 10 it is, it's all about trying to build a better investment process, I suppose. You note eight steps. So I'll read them out really quickly. There's don't look at the stock price. If someone tries to sell you something, don't buy it. Don't talk to management. Gather investment research in the right order, aka SEC filings first and then opinions last. Discuss your investment ideas only with people that have no axe to grind. Never buy or sell stocks when the market is open. If a stock tumbles after you buy it, imagine that you can't sell it for two years. And actually you updated that in your most recent annual report to five years. And also don't talk about your current investments. I was interested sitting here in 2023. Are there any other key points you've added since writing the book? Anything you've added to your investment process or are there any things, any of those points that you wrote that you feel differently about now? So definitely there are points that I feel differently about. The most important one is number three. Don't talk to management. That is a bad idea. You should talk to management. Yes, absolutely. The idea that you would up front, that I would up front close off a whole channel of information without evaluating it is just, it's amazing that I wrote it in there. I look at it and I go, how on earth? And I did. I wrote it. I believed it at the time. I think that the analogy that I like to use is that I'm not a forester. I've never picked up a chainsaw, but I have heard of the title of a movie called The Chainsaw Massacre. And as I understand it, chainsaws are particularly dangerous instruments, especially around limbs. Anyway, you get the picture. So the question is, should you ever pick up a chainsaw? And the answer is, if you need to cut down a forest full of trees, a pen knife ain't going to cut it. So what am I going to do? Not have a chainsaw? Yes, a chainsaw is an extremely dangerous instrument if not used correctly, but it's absolutely necessary to cut down a forest. So you need to use it with great care and respect for the dangers that it poses. And so I would say that speaking to management is a bit like a chainsaw. I mean, management knows so much and have so much knowledge to give and are at the center by definition of a very, very powerful network of people who are specific to that particular company and industry. So the idea that you would drool out speaking to them is a very bad idea. I think that what I say to myself now is that it kind of comes under item four, which is, you know, don't speak to the management upfront. Don't let them boondoggle you or bedazzle you. You know, approach them intelligently, armed with the right background information, insights, and evaluate them intelligently so that, you know, it's a bit like read the instruction manual before you pick up the chainsaw. So that is something that certainly I just disagree with. And it's kind of like to say it upfront because until I do an updated version of my book or write something else for publication, which I will get to correct it properly, I feel like it's out there and it's something I disagree with. I don't feel bad about it. You know, we should welcome changed opinions in ourselves. When we change our opinion, that means we're growing and learning. And that's a good thing. Somebody who doesn't change their opinion on anything is not growing and learning. So it's fine to change one's opinion and to change your process and to change what you do. And so that's one thing very, very clearly. I think that on the others, it's more a kind of a refinement or modification. I mean, speaking about number eight, talking about your investments, I think that, again, that's kind of like too rough a statement. It depends on who you talk to your investments about. And you can go from one extreme to talking on CNBC or to Jim Cramer about the company that you've invested in and why it's going to the moon or not. And then there's talking to one close friend. And then there's all the variations in between. So, you know, I found that talking to my investors, the people who invested in the fund, is a very, very good thing to do. It's a very, very different kind of conversation to, you know, pitching my stock on CNBC. And even within that, there are kind of variations. So what I try to do, and I don't know if I talked about this in the book, you know, even if you're talking one on one to somebody, there are people who are really curious about the world and want to learn more. And there are people who just want to demonstrate that they're right. You know, you want to get more into the category of people who want to learn about the world. You want to get into the category of people who don't want to tell you what to do, but who want to share with you what they did or how they went about it. So exactly, you know, exactly how you talk about your investments is more interesting. Exactly how you talk to management is more interesting. I'm just gazing down the list here because Brandon sent it to me in a very, very nice document. He did quite a bit of preparatory work here, I should let you know. So refinements, I mean, look, my checklist is now, I think, beyond 80 items. So every year in my letter, the letters top of my mind.","The discussion is about the author's book and investment process. In chapter 10 of the book, there are eight steps to building a better investment process, including not looking at stock prices, not buying something if someone tries to sell it to you, and not talking to management. However, the author now disagrees with the idea of not talking to management and says that speaking to management is necessary but should be approached intelligently. The author also feels that some of the other steps need refinement or modification, such as not talking about current investments, which depends on who you talk to."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-XZUvYcrzE_sep_1441_1775,R-XZUvYcrzE_sep_1441_1775,"because I just was reading it and editing it. There's three new checklist items that were added to the letter this year. And again, those are kind of refinements. And what I do with the checklist is I look to see where other people have made mistakes. And I say, hopefully they're not my mistakes. And I say, oh my God, that's checklist item. I could add that in. So I'll just give you one. So what is amazing to me about the period of 2022 is these companies that I yearned to own, Brandon, I was just like, wow, I would just so love to own Roku. I'd so love to own Snowflake. They're so clearly such amazing businesses. And then suddenly I look at them again with a fresh set of eyes after the share prices have dropped so dramatically. And I kind of say, how on earth did the guy you were only six months ago want to own these things? So a simple checklist item is, do they need the capital markets to be open in order to continue to run their business? And I think that, so just to go into the nuance of this, Warren Buffett has said that he wants to own, he would not mind if the stock market was closed for 10 years. And so he didn't have a quotation on the value of the businesses that he owns. He doesn't need the stock market to be open to tell him what the business value is. But then there are some businesses that positively need the capital markets to be open. They cannot run their daily operations if the capital markets are not open. And that may be either because they're funding their losses, they're actually a venture capital investment, and they're not even making money on an operating level. And they need to raise money either through equity issuance or through bond issuance. And I don't want to be invested in those businesses. And in a certain way, those are not good investment. Well, they're kind of venture capital investments, but that's now a checklist item. And many of the companies that I wanted to own last year, they were all kind of like unit economics. So yeah, we're losing money, but if you go on a unit on a customer, if you do the analysis down to the level of a customer, over the lifetime, the customer's a very, very profitable customer for us. And because it's such a profitable customer, we're gonna spend enormous amounts of money in these next few years acquiring as many of them as we can. And then we're gonna have this brilliant future a decade out where all these companies are gonna be, customers are gonna be so profitable for us. But when you look at the income statement, you see a company that's making an operating loss and is raising money from the capital markets. And so one checklist item is I just don't want to be around those people. And if you're a really good business, then you can spend money on acquiring new customers and doing R&D and developing your products while not raising money from the capital markets. And there are businesses that do that. I mean, I don't own them, but Facebook does that. Facebook, everybody's upset because they're spending, what is it, $10 or $15 billion a year on the metaverse, but they're not spending that by raising money. They're not doing a convertible bond issuance. Netflix, not that long ago, issued $18 billion worth of convertible bonds, I believe, in order to invest in new content. And my question is, if you're such a good business, why can't you do that from internally generated cash flow? Anyway, I'm on a hobby horse here, I should stop. Over to you. No, continue. I find it interesting. Well, there we go, that was my point. That's one of the checklist items that I added. And it's just a simple idea. In a certain sense, it's like, do you make an operating profit at the end of the month, at the end of the year, do you have cash in the bank where you get to decide where to spend it? Or is your CFO wondering what to do with the excess cash? Or is your CFO wondering where to get the money to fund your operations and your plans? And it's like, there's this simple idea, and it's funny because it goes down to individuals as well. There's somewhere, this is one of these kind of wise sayings. How rich or poor you are or feel, and how abundant a life you live has got nothing to do with the absolute levels of income and expenditure. It's just got to do, if you spend 1% more than you make, you're always gonna be miserable, and money's always gonna be tight. If you spend 1% less than you make, life's gonna be great, you're gonna be abundant, and you're gonna be able to save and all of those things. And that's just a simple decision. Well, it comes down to corporations as well. You see corporations the same way, and there's a whole class of people out there whose eyes are bigger than their, who see so much opportunity and don't care where the money comes from. And those are not terrible people, that's the whole of Silicon Valley in a certain way. And Silicon Valley has given us so much, so I'm so happy that those people are out there. But I just don't wanna be invested with them. And then there's another kind of person who always says, we're at the end of the year, we've got this money in the bank, we're projected to make this much money, what are we gonna spend our money on? How much are we gonna send back to our investors? And they constantly live within their means, if you like. And those are just better, from my perspective, those are better people to be around. And so, a, you know, and a so, a, you know, and a so, a, you know, and a so, a, you know, and a so, a, you know,",The speaker has added three new items to their investment checklist for 2022. One of the items is whether a company needs the capital markets to remain open to run its business. The speaker does not want to invest in companies that cannot operate without raising money from the capital markets. The speaker believes that the ability to make an operating profit and generate cash flow internally is a sign of a good business. The speaker suggests that a simple decision to spend less than you earn can lead to a more abundant life. The speaker acknowledges that Silicon Valley has given a lot to society but prefers not to invest with companies that do not care where the money comes from.

So how do you build your environment in such a way that you're going to be a better investor? And in my book, we talk about where to put the Bloomberg monitor or where to live. And I know I've talked a little bit about going to the Berkshire Hathaway meeting, or what kind of friends do you have in your life, or when you talk about stocks to the people that you talk about them to, how do you talk about them? But then you get to kind of like in a certain way, advanced environment building is, in a certain way, if I own the shares of a company, I've invited the CEO of that company into my life. Whether I like it or not, in a relationship with that CEO, and that whole ecosystem. So one of the great things about owning Berkshire Hathaway shares is that you're kind of inviting that whole ecosystem into your life, and Brandon, as you know, which you've been, it's an amazing ecosystem. Why would you not want that in your life? I own shares of an investment firm based in Turin, Italy, which is this company Exor, which is the chairman of Ferrari, is also the chairman of Exor. And I think he's a really astute guy, and it's really annoying, Brandon, he's 10 years younger than me, and he's sort of like Italian royalty, his name's John Elkan. But in part, I've invested there because I want to be a part of that ecosystem. It's a really, really good ecosystem, and that ecosystem will then impact me. And so who I'm invested in, getting around people who think in that way, who think not the world's full of opportunity and I just need to find people to give me money so I can pursue that opportunity, rather people who say, you know, how do I spend less than I make, and then when there's something left over, how do I find intelligent things to do with what's left over? So we've been talking a lot about, I guess, all these practical steps as to, you know, staying rational and surrounding yourself with the right people and, you know, making sure that you're in that world. I guess this is all very applicable for people that are interested in making individual investments like Warren Buffett-style investments. I'm also interested, I just wanted to finish up by talking about the concept of passive investing, which is the other end of the spectrum, which I guess you do have to detach yourself from your emotions, but it's a much different strategy dollar cost averaging where you just keep plugging away no matter what's happening in the market. I'm interested, obviously your investing is very much about finding stocks that you hope will outperform the market, but I wanted to circle back to the new investor, the investor that's just getting started. As someone that has done this for decades and decades, do you kind of gravitate more towards, maybe if you're a new investor, passive investing is just a good way to go, or do you think that people should try from the start to educate themselves in business and in investing in that Buffett-style and kind of fail and pick yourself back up, and do you think that's a better long-term strategy? So I think that probably this idea of dollar cost averaging is good across passive investing and active investing, so in an ideal world, and I did this when I started the fund and I took over a laddered bond portfolio. I told myself rather than, when I saw a good idea, rather than sell down the bonds to buy that good idea, I just allowed those bonds to mature over time and use that cash as it became available, so that was a kind of a dollar cost averaging into individual stocks. And then I think that deciding, the world is full of so many different kinds of people, and I think that it comes down to the individual of knowing yourself and knowing, or at least, and if you don't know yourself, being willing to undertake the exploration of who am I and what kind of relationship do I want to the world of business and investing, I guess. And I think that all options are valid, well, all sensible options are valid. Taking your money to a casino or to the equivalent of casino is not a great way to preserve your wealth, but to say, and the great thing about investing in public securities is that you can decide, you don't have to do one or the other, so I don't think that there's anything wrong with somebody saying, look, I know that the index is gonna work pretty well, but I do wanna spend some time doing some of it on my own, so I'm going to do one third the index, the index, the index, the index, the index, the index, the index.","The discussion covers topics related to building a better investing environment, including where to place a Bloomberg monitor, attending the Berkshire Hathaway meeting, and surrounding oneself with people who think about investing as a way to spend less than they make and find intelligent ways to use what is left over. The importance of ecosystem is highlighted, as owning shares in a company means inviting its CEO and the whole ecosystem into one's life. The concept of passive investing is also discussed, with the suggestion that dollar-cost averaging can be used for both passive and active investing. Ultimately, the decision of whether to engage in passive or active investing depends on the individual's goals and preferences."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-XZUvYcrzE_sep_2070_2447,R-XZUvYcrzE_sep_2070_2447,"I'm gonna pick an index, and I'm gonna do one third individual stock picks, and I'm gonna do one third cash, because that's gonna make me feel safe. I wrote something a while ago, interestingly enough, might be something for a follow-on video along the thing that we talked about, in which I asked the question with whom would I invest? And the question I ask is if I wasn't doing what I'm doing full-time, how would I go about it? What I came down to was kind of like, I want five buckets, if you like, or five different things, because more than five, you get a headache. But one of those things might be an index. Another one of those things might be a company like Berkshire Hathaway or Exor. Another one of those things might be an individual business like Nestle or Moody's or something, and I would just do five of them, basically. So you can kind of have, you can have, you've just divided into active and passive investing, you can do 50-50, or you can do one third, one third, one third. But I think that the key is to know yourself and know what your interests are. And if your interests are somewhere else, then that's totally fine, do an index. And I'm interested as well, I'm conscious of the time as well, so I'll just finish off this with this one last question and then let you go. Obviously, you are an active fund manager, so I'm very interested to hear your thoughts, because everybody, we all know that the majority of active fund managers don't beat the S&P 500 over a long period of time. I think it's in the States, it's like over 15, the last 15 years, 89% of active fund managers haven't beaten the market. Your fund is one of the rare exceptions, which is great. By a very minor margin. Yeah. The margin's very slim. But I'm wondering, why do you think it is that so many active managers don't succeed in this task? And I guess if investors want to look at a fund manager or someone they trust their money to, what sort of qualities, what should they be looking for in that fund manager? In the last five years, I think, Brandon, I have not beaten the S&P, including last year. And a part of my letter is writing about why, even though I got so many things right, I still didn't beat the S&P last year, which is a kind of a frustration for me, but hopefully I'll be, good things will happen for me this year or the following year. I would also say that the margin by which I've beaten the S&P is slim, it's like about 1%. As net of all fees, but it's a slim margin. It's really, really, really tough to do. And I think that, so I just had a conversation yesterday with somebody, those listeners who kind of enter this stuff may really enjoy getting his book. He's a guy called Luca Dallana, and he's written a book on a word that all my non-math friends are gonna be upset at me for saying it's called ergodicity. But I just wanna explain the idea here because it's just a, Brandon, it's a really, really, really powerful and important idea, and I'm gonna explain it in the way that Luca Dallana explains it, which is, I guess you don't get much skiing in the parts that you are, but. Unfortunately not. Yeah, so the skier who wants to win the season has to make a very, very difficult trade-off because if he skis the fastest possible, increases the likelihood of injury, and if he injures himself or she injures herself, then they're not going to get to the end of the season. But in the dynamics of the individual race, there is enormous pressure to ski as fast as you can and take a hidden risk that you will get injured. And when you win the race, nobody says, oh my god, you took all these hidden risks, that actually wasn't optimal for the whole season. And so there are things that appear optimal from one perspective, which are not optimal from another perspective, and often I think that we as investors get the perspective wrong. And so, you know, if I was to go into the task of running a great fund and I try to put up really, really good numbers, but I take hidden risks to do it, and then at the end of five years or at the end of N years, I blow up, and that happens constantly and consistently. And so that's a big part of what makes it extraordinarily hard to have a long track record, and especially a long track record that beats the index. I think that what I figured out maybe a decade ago was that because it's so hard to beat the index and because such a big proportion of the fund is either immediate family myself or people that I know well, and I'm not willing to take hidden risks in order to juice returns and then show up one year and be down permanently 50% and trash the track record and blow up, what I did was I realized that what I could do is drive down the cost of investing with me. And funnily enough, as a guy who's a quote, active manager, I've driven myself to be incredibly passive because what I see and what we all see at Berkshire Hathaway is that if you get the right businesses into your portfolio, you can do extraordinarily well. And that frees up an enormous amount of, when your intent is to be passive, you free up an awful lot of brain cycles to think about something else. And actually speaking of that, just going back to your list or my list of eight things that you read back to me, I think that I actually look at the stock price even less frequently than I used to. So it's just like, it's just not worth looking at. It's not worth looking at it because it just drives brain cycles. You're better off just reading the 10K once a quarter or even every six months.","The discussion covers different aspects of investing in finance. The speakers share their views on active and passive investing, and how it is important to know oneself when it comes to investing. The speakers also discuss the challenges of being an active fund manager and why most active fund managers don't beat the S&P 500 over a long period of time. They highlight the importance of taking risks that are optimal for the long term rather than ones that may yield better returns in the short term but could result in significant losses later. Finally, the speakers discuss driving down the cost of investing as a way to improve returns, and the importance of getting the right businesses into one's portfolio."

I actually, I heard everyone that Brandon doesn't do Twitter. And I actually love Twitter. I do like it, yeah. I just don't post. Yeah, but even with Elon Musk at the helm, I think that Twitter is this really powerful. So I learned to use Twitter from a guy called David Perel. And he has a great podcast or a YouTube video with somebody, sort of how to crush it on Twitter. And one of the key things on Twitter is the minute you see a troll, the minute you see somebody who's posting content that is not positive, you just got to block them or mute them or get rid of them. So focus. There's a whole area of Twitter called Science Twitter, where you can get into discussions with scientists on cutting edge research. It's a really, really fascinating platform. So I think probably the easiest place is Twitter, which is at G Spear. And Brandon and I have talked about collaborating on one or two YouTube videos. So you can find me on YouTube. And obviously, I have a website. But even more interesting for me is if you've got any in the, I love receiving unsolicited write-ups, investment ideas. I have an email newsletter. When I see good ones and I get permission from the person who sent it to me, I resend it out. So I have about 20,000 people on my email newsletter right now, which goes out two or three times a year. Brandon, and forgive me. I may be going off script or something. But the world has become such a fascinating and interesting place in part through the social media. Because here I am talking to Brandon. Right now, I happen to be sitting in a suburb of London close to where my parents live. And Brandon's in the capital of Australia. And we can have this conversation. We have a potentially global audience. And I think that this is an idea that I learned from David Perel. When you create content, and this is content creation, then you're putting the algorithm to work for you. So I don't know who's going to be watching this video. But it's fun to meet you because the algorithm has decided that you should be watching me and Brandon talking, which is kind of cool. And I'm actually interested in send me investment ideas, send me investment thoughts. And it's kind of cool that this, I don't know which corners of the Earth this will reach. But to the extent that it reaches you and it touches you, feel free to write in. Write into email or on Twitter, do you think? I think Twitter is probably a good place to write into where you can find me on LinkedIn. And email is really, really, really, really tough. It's just like it's not that you'll get any more attention if you write in on email. And my assistant will get very upset at me if I share my email address publicly. But if you DM me on Twitter, then either I or somebody who helps me will respond or DM me on LinkedIn is also totally fine. I don't do Facebook very much. And I don't really read the messages I get on Instagram, although I do enjoy posting on Instagram. Very good. Guy, thank you very much for your time. It's been an absolute honor to have you on the podcast and on the channel. So thank you for sparing quite a considerable chunk of your morning to chat with me and to share your knowledge with the listeners. We very much appreciate it. And with that, we'll look forward to our follow-up podcast whenever that may be. And you know, everyone, I hadn't met Brandon in real time like this until this morning. But you're kind of inspiring. It's an inspiration to meet people like you. And we spent quite a bit of time. I was learning quite a bit from Brandon. So the world is a wonderful place. And thank you for inspiring me. Guy, thank you very much. Well, guys, that was it. That was my talk with Guy Spear. I hope you guys really enjoyed that. Definitely let me know.

Are you chasing a certain goal in a certain timeline? Like is there a money number that you are after? Is it 200 billion? That will make you the richest? No, I did this calculation for calculating what is my FIRE number. FIRE is financial independence retire early. I'm sorry, you're familiar with that. So I did that calculation for myself and it came up to about, I think it was six crores and I made a tweet on that as well. I'm saying and the lifestyle that you can lead with six crores and for most people it was surprising. The lifestyle that you can lead with six crores that you can comfortably spend like 20 to 30 lakhs a year, which I think is more than enough money for a person like me because I am a person who likes to spend on experience. So I would bulk up that 20 to 30 lakhs would go on like two to three international vacations because I love spending on that. And then the remainder of the time is just being in India and doing my thing. So for that kind of lifestyle 20 to 30 lakhs is what I calculated. Now to sustain that kind of lifestyle and if you want to quit working, not saying I will quit working after reaching a milestone like that, but if I have that option to quit, so that is the financial independence number. So six crores is the number with which you can live that kind of lifestyle. So I would say that. That's the number. That's great man. It's awesome that you have a number in mind because I'm often shocked at how many people don't even know what is it that they're chasing and they consistently just chasing. And that's the worst thing because even when you hit that number, you will still continue chasing because you didn't know that you've hit it. So I love that.

,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGW6VXHsND8_sep_0_290,XGW6VXHsND8_sep_0_290,"One of the things that I didn't know in my 20s, and I'm curious, you did because you started a company very young. Sam Alkman from Y Combinator often said that one of the ways to become successful is you need to own something. You don't become successful by renting your time. You become successful by owning an equity in a business, and it could be an infrastructure, natural resources, it could be anything. But equity is the one that really scales. Do you agree with that? And if you agree with that, how do you tell all the young generation of Indians to think about that? Should they all go start startups, or what's your advice for the best way for them to think about ownership and equity? I think this is really fast forward to think about equity. In India, 99% of people don't understand what is inflation. Because they don't understand inflation, they have no understanding of what compound interest is. And they don't know if they keep money in their account, earning 3%, when the country's inflation is at 6%, that wealth has actually deteriorated. They don't understand. Because all of us grew up with this mindset that parents should have saved money. So everybody saved money instead of investing. So everybody has a saving account, and India has tons of money lying around in a saving account, earning 2% interest. Even if you put money in a liquid mutual fund or whatever, you'll actually learn more than that. But the idea of being safe and save money keeps us in that particular manner. So my view is that the total number of hours anybody in India has got any financial literacy training is probably one or two for their entire life. Their parents do not create wealth. And there is a lot of shame to discuss with friends about wealth, because it's almost like, according to me, financial literacy is very similar to sexual literacy. People do not find comfort in talking about it. And in a patriarchal society where you need a lot of status to appear to be all cool and smart, asking about dumb questions is not appreciated. This is a country where asking dumb questions naturally makes people feel that you are dumb. But the only way you become smart is by asking dumb questions. Because that's when somebody will teach you. Then you will find out what are the different ways to fight inflation. And what are the different ways to make the compound interest work in your favor versus work against you. For example, if credit cards are charging a 50% interest rate in India, that's compound interest working against you. But let's say some equity fund is giving you, let's say, 10% return. That's in compound interest working in your favor. And I think understanding at financial literacy level is so poor and so basic. And currently, so many members are above 750 with multiple credit cards. We did a recent survey. And we discovered that most people, 70%, 80% of them, think that their credit card interest is only 10% or 15%, which is not. It is 50%. So the thing is that there is no correlation to academics, no correlation to IQ, no correlation to income. In fact, this topic is never discussed. It's almost shameful to talk about money in India because it demonstrates weakness in some ways. So we are a society that is all pretending to be all cool. But we do not understand the concept of wealth, unlike some business communities. So what I've seen is that there's a lot of Gujarati families or Marwadi families or any other business families. One interesting pattern I have seen is that when you were a kid, did the parents teach you to think in percentages? I've seen that to be the strongest correlation of people who understand things. A lot of other places, everything is spoken in absolute amounts. But if you grew up in a Gujarati or a Marwadi family, you're always spoken in tukka. Tukka is the thing that you have to learn. And an interesting thing I've observed is that in a typical Gujarati family, you could be academically smart. But if you do not understand money, you are called doba, which is a nasty word to tell a kid that you are basically a dumb, deep kind of a thing. So the thing is, shaming the right understanding of money. And we only say, oh, you got into engineering and IIT. What if you don't understand money? What if you don't understand how tukka works? And we are extraordinarily algebra, terrible at money. Correct. It's true.","The discussion highlights the lack of financial literacy in India, where most people don't understand inflation, compound interest, or how to make their money work for them. The society also views discussing money as shameful, and there is a lot of pressure to appear cool and smart, which discourages people from asking questions and learning about financial matters. While owning equity in a business is touted as a way to become successful, the majority of people in India have no knowledge or access to such opportunities. The speaker observes that business families in Gujarat and Marwadi communities have a stronger understanding of money, with children being taught to think in percentages from an early age."

I mean, is it more like they didn't have access to financial markets? Well, some of it is that. But I do agree with you, like we all grew up saying, you know, you have to save 50 percent in savings. You invest the rest in gold. But how do we change this? Because clearly there is a pattern where this works. We see the developed markets. It works. I think first is introducing capitalism in our education system. We have no clue what capitalism is. We all of in India have MRP in the products and we think it's a great idea. We don't understand it's actually bad for the country because you are standardizing one price. And I think my biggest problem is to understand that can we create a culture where capitalism is taught, financial literacy is taught from school days because we cannot really expect parents to teach when they don't know this themselves. Right. If you send kids to teach, learn English when parents do not know English, why are we not teaching financial literacy? Because parents have not been taught these things. Right. And just because they own a house doesn't mean they understand what equity means. Right. And if you look at the data, the number of people who are investing in equity is so small. In fact, it's so concentrated in business communities. Again, if you look at Gujarat and like two, three other states where business communities exist, almost everybody is participating over there. And in some states, it just doesn't exist. So I think we are stuck on our relationship with money is not a pleasant one. It is one which is confused. It is one where we are really not sure if we should be having a relationship with money or not. And unless we break that, we are not going to become. So one of the things that most people don't understand about India is that we talk about our per capita income is 2000 dollars. Right. What most people don't talk about probably our median is probably 600. Right. The averages are fooling most people, including founders and investors. Only the top percent is compounding. Yeah. Investments and securities market are subject to market risks. Read all the related documents carefully before investing. Please read the risk disclosure documents carefully before investing in equity shares, derivatives, mutual fund and other instruments traded on.","The discussion touches on the lack of financial education in India and the need for it to be introduced in schools. The participants feel that the current relationship with money is confused and that financial literacy is not taught at home, making it essential to teach it in schools. The discussion also highlights the concentration of equity investment in business communities in a few states, and the need to break the pattern for everyone to benefit from financial markets. The participants also note that India's per capita income figures can be misleading, as only the top percentile is compounding investments in securities markets, and the risk disclosure documents should be read carefully before investing."

He very characteristically made his investment style seem so perfectly simple. The first rule in investment is don't lose. And the second rule in investment is don't forget the first rule. And that's all the rules there are. I mean, if you buy things for far below what they're worth, and you buy a group of them, you basically don't lose money. Warren, what do you consider the most important quality for an investment manager? It's the temperamental quality, not an intellectual quality. You don't need tons of IQ in this business. I mean, you have to have enough IQ to get from here to downtown Omaha. But you do not have to be able to play three-dimensional chess or be in the top leagues in terms of bridge playing or something of the sort. You need a stable personality. You need a temperament that neither derives great pleasure from being with the crowd or against the crowd. Because this is not a business where you take polls. It's a business where you think. And Ben Graham would say that you're not right or wrong because 1,000 people agree with you. And you're not right or wrong because 1,000 people disagree with you. You're right because your facts and your reasoning are right. Warren, what do you do that's different than 90% of the money managers who are in the market? Certainly most of the professional investors focus on what the stock is likely to do in the next year or two. And they have all kinds of arcane methods of approaching that. But they do not really think of themselves owning a piece of a business. But the real test of whether you're investing, from a value standpoint or not, is whether you care whether the stock market is open tomorrow. If you're making a good investment in a security, it shouldn't bother you if they close down the stock market for five years. All the ticker tells me is the price. And I can look at the price occasionally to see whether the price is outlandishly cheap or outlandishly high. But prices don't tell me anything about a business. Business figures themselves tell me something about a business. But the price of a stock doesn't tell me anything about a business. I would rather value a stock or a business first and not even know the price so that I'm not influenced by the price in establishing my valuation. And then look at the price later to see whether it's way out of line with a business.","The discussion is about investing, particularly the investment style of Warren Buffett. He emphasizes the importance of not losing money and buying things for less than they are worth. He believes that an investment manager's most important quality is a stable personality and a temperament that neither follows nor goes against the crowd. Buffett also differentiates his investment approach from that of most professional investors who focus on short-term stock price movements rather than owning a piece of a business. He prefers to value a stock or a business first without knowing its price and then compare the price to the valuation later."

I mean, I don't know what cocoa beans are going to do. There are all kinds of things I don't know about. And that may be too bad, but why should I know all about them? I haven't worked that hard on them. In securities business, you literally every day have thousands of the major American corporations offered to you at a price and a price that changes daily. And you don't have to make any decisions. You have to make nothing is forced upon you. So you there are no called strikes in the business. The pitcher just stands there and throws balls at you. And if you're playing real baseball and it's between the knees and the shoulders, you either swing or you got a strike call on you. If you get too many call on you, you're out. In the securities business, you sit there and they throw US Steel at 25 and they throw General Motors at 60 and you don't have to swing at any of them. They may be wonderful pitches to swing at, but if you don't know enough, you don't have to swing and you can sit there and watch thousands of pitches. And finally you get one right there where you want it. Something that you understand and then you swing. And so you might not swing for six months. You might not swing for two years. It's that boring. It would. It would bore most people and certainly boredom is a, is a, is a problem with most professional money managers. If they, if they, if they try to sit out on anything or two, not only do they get somewhat antsy, but their clients or start yelling, start yelling, swing you bum, you know, from the, from the stands. And that's very tough for people to do. Warren, your, your approach seems so simple. Why doesn't everybody do it? Well, I think partly because it is so simple that the academics, for example, focus on, on all kinds of variables. Partly because academics, you mean professors of finance and business school? Sure. And the data is there. So they focus on whether if you buy stocks on Tuesday and sell them on Friday, you're better off or if you buy them in election years and sell them in other years, you're better off or if you buy small companies, there are all these variables because the data are there and, and they've learned how to manipulate data. And as a friend of mine says to a man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail. And once you have these skills, you just are, are dying to, to utilize them in some way, but they aren't important. If I were being asked to participate in a business opportunity, would it make any difference to me whether I bought it on a Tuesday or a Saturday or an election year or something? It's not what a businessman thinks about in buying businesses. So why think about it when buying stocks? Because stocks are just pieces of sissabit sissabit sissabit sissabit sissabit sissabit.","In this discussion, Warren Buffett explains his investment strategy, which is focused on making informed and patient decisions. He emphasizes the importance of understanding the businesses you invest in and waiting for the right opportunities, rather than constantly trying to make quick profits. Buffett suggests that many people in the finance industry focus too much on analyzing data and finding patterns rather than using common sense and practical knowledge. He believes that buying stocks should be treated like buying businesses, and that many of the variables that academics study are not important when making investment decisions. In summary, Buffett's approach to finance is simple and patient, focused on making informed decisions based on practical knowledge rather than complex analysis."

So you're playing with it. You're making all sort of stacks and towers and now it's sort of become a game Right. Yeah, if suddenly people put a million dollars of cash in front of you again You are like, Oh my god. Right. Like am I really gonna bet a million dollars in this hand? So by the way, crypto does the same thing. Right? Suddenly, you have Ethereum Bitcoin. You're like hmm It's not really if one Bitcoin isn't really now worth $68,000. It is a Bitcoin Right. What do I do with it to make it productive, which I think is a good abstraction as well Yeah. Yeah, so many questions about crypto.","The discussion talks about the concept of abstraction in gaming and how it relates to finance, particularly with the use of chips in poker. The idea is that using chips removes the abstraction of money, allowing players to play more freely without the pressure of handling large sums of cash. Similarly, crypto also acts as an abstraction, with the value of cryptocurrencies being detached from their physical form. The conversation ends with a mention of the many questions surrounding crypto."

You know, but before we head into that section of the podcast, I'd actually quickly like to highlight two things. One, why did you leave that job of being at the hedge fund? Also explain what a hedge fund is for listeners who don't know what it is. And secondly, I think you went into a risky business right after the hedge fund phase of your life. So these two questions for you. Explain the hedge fund, explain what a hedge fund is. And then explain the business you tried after the hedge fund. Correct. So the best way to explain hedge funds is, it's a, you collect a pool of money from institutional sophisticated investors. Rich people. Really rich people. And institutions as well, like your pension funds, etc. And really I would, the simplest way I can explain the hedge fund businesses in the financial markets, everyone is driving a road roller. But because they're driving a road roller, which is big, they leave pennies there. And a hedge fund is really the vacuum cleaner that goes out and takes away the penny. What does that mean? Like say the market is in bull market right now. Everybody would be buying NASDAQ because that's the easiest way. But while buying NASDAQ, they will leave an opportunity to do, say, sell NASDAQ future and buy the underlying stocks. As simple as that. And still make 15, 20% risk-free. Right. So a hedge fund comes and does those risk-free sort of, I'll call it non-sexy trades, which other people are overlooking because they are just looking at some other trend, which is really in vogue. Right. So the trend of NASDAQ and the tech stocks going up is your road roller. They leave tons of pennies lying around and they don't care about it. Right. So there the sophisticated strategies come up, much less risk and a very decent return for that amount of risk. From the little I've understood about the skill of working in the stock market, is that if you follow a certain set of rules and play a very functional game without much creativity, it's actually a very good game to play in that world. It will guarantee you some amount of profits and money forever. What I'm understanding from the world of hedge funds is exactly that. That you guys are a bunch of very disciplined professionals who follow a set of rules and probably apply a little bit of creativity once you've mastered the rules. Correct. Make more money and then keep kind of compounding on that money. Yeah, I think that's pretty accurate. So, you know, we just call it like investing frameworks, which you're calling discipline. Right. It's exactly that. You look at a market for a while, you figure out this is the way the market works. You build a framework around it and you figure out what is your advantage in that framework. Right. And then you execute that strategy in a very disciplined, risk controlled manner. So you're right. The creativity part, it's not a job where you go in every day and say, okay, today I'm going to do A and tomorrow I'll do B and third day C. It is you figure out much more longer term sort of opportunities to do it. The advantage is that in case you are wrong about it, it's also very liquid. Like you can get out. Right. So like George Soros famously said, he's never got married. Right. And he famously said that I've never entered a trade I cannot get out of. And marriage seems like that. That I put on a trade and can never get out of it. And that's the beauty of trading that, you know, the risk of the feeling that, hey, if I do this, what happens if I want to get out of it doesn't exist. Well, yeah, you could lose some money, but you know that before you did the analysis, right? Like what is the amount of money you could lose? So you go in as a disciplined investor, you could come out and re go back into the market. With business, it's very different. Yeah. What I'm assuming is that that phase of your life gave you an outlook on what's happening in the world and what markets are coming up. Am I right? Yeah. So I'll say that the number one thing again from it is pattern recognition. Right. So I think, so my bet used to always be on the macro side in equity and credit markets. And really my skill that I honed there was how do I recognize pattern and trends a little before other people do. Right. So the idea was it's flow on a macro scale. It's definitely flow on a macro scale. Right. So you're really looking at what are all the players doing in the market. Right. So similarly, when I came in and did business is my number one thing, which I am definitely very confident about is figuring out that I'm in the right trend and in the right wave that's going to really ride everything. Right. So in finance, they always say trend is your friend and never sort of go against the tide. And that is definitely true for 80 to 90% of profits you make in finance. If you figure out the right trend, see if tech stocks are going up, maybe somebody buying Google may make more money than somebody buying Microsoft, but both will make money. But if tech stocks are going down, you may lose less money by buying Google than Microsoft, but you're still going to lose money. So who cares? So the trend is really, really important in finance, as is it in every area of your life. Yeah. Right. If you pick the right trend, it makes life much, much simpler. Yeah. 100%. So, um, around two, um, around two, um,","In this podcast, the guest explains hedge funds as a business that collects money from wealthy individuals and institutions to make investments in the financial markets. Hedge funds make money by taking advantage of the opportunities that other investors overlook, such as non-sexy trades that offer decent returns for less risk. The guest emphasizes the importance of discipline and following investing frameworks in order to execute strategies in a risk-controlled manner. He also discusses the importance of recognizing patterns and trends in the market, which he gained from his experience in the hedge fund industry. He compares the difference between trading and doing business, stating that with trading, you can easily get in and out of investments, whereas with business, it's more complex.

,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbmzwvXCuWE_sep_1308_1642,MbmzwvXCuWE_sep_1308_1642,"Two years ago, I met a very young college grad who had just started working at Wall Street and he had those ambitions of making it big at Wall Street. Yeah. So, I asked him a very simple question. I asked him that I'm sure because you started working at Wall Street and you're so passionate about it, you know what's up in the financial world and in terms of what are Wall Street bankers looking at as the next big opportunities. He said, dude, I have a simple answer. Weed and gaming. These are the two domains that Wall Street is very excited about. Right. So, maybe you can explain to the listeners what it even means to say that Wall Street is excited about these two domains. And the second question I have for you is break down those two domains a little bit. I also feel now in the last year or so, there's a third domain that's added which is blockchain. Right. But you can take it from here. What is Wall Street in the first place for someone who's hearing these terms for the first time. Right. So, Wall Street is like your original Dalal Street where all the big banks and financial places sit in New York. Right. US is by far still the largest stock market financial market in the world and Wall Street is where all these banks are. So, it is definitely the epicenter of everything happening around the world in the area of finance. So, yeah, I agree. Weed and gaming are really two big trends in the world. Why is that the case? See, I think if we take a step back and look at a simple Maslow's theory, right, which is I first wanted security, then I wanted to fulfill my physiological needs of eating food and so on. And then eventually I want to do something competent and then look at self-actualization. As the world is getting more structured and as we evolve, now I'm taking a little bit of history of as we evolve from agriculture revolution to industrial revolution, even India. Imagine India during our parents and grandparents generation where all the parents, our parents used to worry about is, hey, you got to find something which feeds the family every day. Like now we see, you know, your generation in particular, a little less of my generation, but a lot in your generation doing a lot of things that they're passionate about. Right. They're very much more confident that they'll make the money because if they follow the passion, like you said, be in that state of flow, the money will follow, right, without having to worry about the money. So why does weed and gaming fit into this? You know, weed at the end of the day has two big uses, right? One is medicinal. The other is obviously a little bit of recreational. The recreational aspect is probably a little more controversial. The medical aspect has been clear for a really long time. Right. Weed, the CBD component of it, the cannabidiol part of it has been used in Ayurveda, you know, since ages in India, has been used in other medicines as well. Some part of THC is also pain reliever, right? So we take a lot of pain relievers. There is caffeine in pain relievers. There is some part of THC in pain relievers. Morphine is given as a pain reliever. Of course, because it's recreational, it has some psychotropic substances. There is definitely a potential of abuse, right? Which is why, you know, maybe there were regulations made earlier. I feel like, you know, India banned it, US banned it. And the reason they banned it during the time of Nixon was because of pharmaceutical companies, right? So the one major reason of allopathic medicines is to relieve you of pain, right? Because pain is something that no one wants to tolerate. And so our life is driven more by pain alleviation than it is driven by finding passion and finding happiness, right? So if something can relieve pain, you would pay immediate money for it, right? And if pharmaceutical companies thought that cannabis is allowed, then what money would they really make, right? So I think that drove US to ban it, India to ban it, many countries to ban it. And over time, as they realize, they have looked at the experiments in Scandinavia, right? Cases of overabuse there are much less because it's legalized than it is in other areas, right? And people, in my view, will always find things to do which give them happiness. And, you know, unfortunately, weed, smoking, alcohol are all areas of synthetic happiness, right? So, of course, I could meditate and get in that state of flow and get in the zone. Or I could have weed or alcohol or smoke a lot, etc. and get into that zone of meditation, right? So one of the things I'll borrow from Tim Ferriss is he always says that if you really want to experience the benefits of meditation, maybe if it's allowed in your country, take some psychotropic substances so that you can actually get to the end result. And once you know that, okay, this is going to be the end result, you would be highly motivated to do meditation to get to that end result, right? So weed in a way is getting you sort of medically has great usage, also recreationally gives you the promised land. And, of course, it's controlled and regulated. I think it's going to be a massive, massive opportunity, right? Because it's an innate human need. Similarly, gaming, right? Now in gaming, obviously, gaming, like you talked about addiction, a lot of people think that, hey, gaming is just useless activity, right? It's only done for entertainment, etc. A lot of benefits, like I said, you enter a state of flow. There's a lot of camaraderie, right? Like I play Clash of Clans a lot. I can tell you, like, even if I meet someone who's playing Clash of Clans on the mobile phone right next to me on the airport, I'll be like, bro, what's your town hall? Maybe like, I'm town hall 11. I'm like, I'm town hall 12. Right? I suddenly feel better about myself. And you know, like how a lot of people say that, people say that, people say that, people say that.","The discussion centers on two domains that Wall Street is interested in: weed and gaming. The conversation explains how these two areas have become increasingly important, with the potential for significant growth in the future. The use of cannabis for medicinal purposes has been known for a long time, but its recreational use is more controversial. Gaming, on the other hand, is a rapidly growing industry that has become more popular in recent years. The discussion also mentions blockchain as a third area that Wall Street is excited about. Overall, the conversation highlights the significance of these three domains in the financial world and the potential for significant investment opportunities."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIRgrTFooZI_sep_413_978,mIRgrTFooZI_sep_413_978,"And now that we're done speaking to all the core TRS listeners who love self-improvement and emotional health, let's talk for the people who are here for you only, which is all the finance geeks and everyone who wants to be updated on what's happened in the world of finance. So this past week, the budget was announced for 2022. And I'm sure you've gotten a zillion questions about the budget. So I'm not going to ask you all the cliched questions. What I will ask you is that for someone who's living under a rock who doesn't know what went down in the budget, how does a Nikhil Kamath look at it? You're at the center of the world of finance. So what's been up? What's happened in the last week? Yeah. So let me first take it from an investor trader standpoint. What we are hoping for from the budget, you know, some things we've been asking for, for a long time. I'm going to put myself in the investor bracket and talk like that. There's something called STT, security transaction tax. For I don't know how many years now, people have been kind of like paying this indirect tax. It's paid when you make money or do not make money on a trade, but you still pay it. And it's about 1800 rupees per crore of turnover and you paid only on the sell side. But what people fail to realize is about 80, 90 percent of the volume of trades in India or the turnover in India happens on the derivatives market where there is leverage inherently. So somebody with one lakh rupees is taking positions worth five lakh rupees. So it's not hard for somebody with a couple of lakh rupees in his account to maybe do a few crores of turnover a day on a notional basis. What happens with STT is it makes the ecosystem inefficient. Say, for example, I'm trading Nifty futures or Bank Nifty, which are the most common contracts. If I were to enter and exit 10 times in a day or 20 times in a day, if I were to end up being as much as 20 points in STT alone, for me to then break even, I need to like capture 20 points of Nifty just to be like, you know, level zero zero kind of thing. So it kind of makes it very hard for speculators, a lot of day traders, people who are doing this full time for a living to remain profitable for a long time. The ecosystem, you know, in some ways, the government, we all always kind of frown upon these speculators with high leverage. But one has to understand these are the guys making the market for everybody. They're reducing the impact cost. They're making it easier for foreigners to come into the country and invest. You know, if I'm a foreign fund and if I have to buy 10% of a certain stock in India over a one month period, if not for these people, it would be a lot more inefficient and the cost would be significantly higher. So we need these people and we need to support this kind of, you know, this category of people who are doing trading full time for a living. STT was implemented when Chidambaram kind of did away with long term capital gain tax. But now we have LTCG and STT, so it kind of doesn't make sense. That's something I think everybody in the industry has wanted for a long time now. I hope it happens in the future. It did not happen on this particular budget. The second thing is again, focusing on these full time traders again. Derivatives are taxed at the max income tax rate. And in many cases, people need derivatives to hedge their portfolio, build a better risk reward profile, create a more robust trading portfolio by using, you know, things like maybe you're doing, you're writing covered calls, maybe you're running strategies which reduce the underlying risk. And this shouldn't be discouraged with such a high tax rate, especially when on LTCG you're only paying 10%. This is what we were expecting from an investor trader standpoint. Neither has happened, but that's okay. And maybe in the future it will. If I were to go back and look at it as an entrepreneur, as a businessman, taxation in India is really high today. If I'm a company and I'm the promoter of the company, today, if I make 100 rupees of profit, I pay a corporate tax rate of 25 rupees upfront. So I'm left with 75 rupees. Now let's assume I want to take out money and buy myself a home. To withdraw the 75 rupees which is left as dividend distribution tax, I need to pay another 35.8% tax on it. So it makes my net effective tax rate about 51, 52 rupees. This is not withstanding stamp duty and STD and all the other taxes like a business guy or somebody focused on the finance world might have to pay. This is bad. Taxation at such a high level discourages entrepreneurship. If you were to go back in time, there's many people, politicians across the world who have run this experiment as to what the ideal tax rate should be. I think Nixon did it, JFK did it. I think during JFK's era, at one point he dropped tax rates down to 16% from different rates. They were at 50 at one point, 40 at one point, 30 at one point. So when he went from 30 to 16, what he realized is the incentive to evade taxes became so small that actually more tax collection happened. More people came out and paid tax. So it's a bit counter-intuitive, but at the right level, more people will come out and pay tax and especially in a country like India where 1% of our population pays tax and there is a big part of society that should be supported and all of that. But there are very many people in India evading tax. And hopefully bringing down the tax rates to more reasonable levels will incentivize these people to come out and pay. So from that end, dividend distribution tax again, nothing changed. I hope it happens in the future. They cap the surcharge on private companies' long-term capital gain tax. So what that essentially means is a lot of people in our ecosystem, Kunal and Sachin. So all these startup promoters or promoters of any kind of companies in India, which are if the promoter is getting an exit, he would earlier have paid a long-term capital gain tax of 28%. Now because of the cap and surcharge, it comes down to 23%. This is good because we were losing a lot of entrepreneurs to countries like Singapore, jurisdictions where tax rates are a lot more favorable. Like Singapore does not have capital gain, right? Even on salaries and incomes, I think the max rate they charge is about 17%. Like Dubai did not have any kind of tax up until they implemented VAT a few years ago. And I think last week they came out with a corporate tax rate of 9%. So bringing that 28 down to 23 is a great step in the right direction. It will disincentivize many people in the ecosystem who are considering relocating to better tax geographies. So that's another thing. Another big thing that I think the budget was Capex focused, which is good. The government intends to spend more money next year. This is generally a good thing for equity markets because more consumption, more spending, bid on infra or anything will generally boost a lot of stocks in different sectors. The government intends to, if I'm not wrong, spend something like 39-40 lakh crores next year. We know how they will collect 24-25 lakh crores. How the deficit of 15 lakh crores will come, where the government will get it from, what rate will they borrow it. There's a lot of ambiguity there. I think we'll have to wait and watch. It's even more, you know, like one has to be more curious because even the divestment number this year is very, very tiny compared to what one would have assumed. People were thinking two, two and a half lakh crores, but it's only around 60-70,000 crores. So one really has to wait and watch what will happen to that 15 lakh crore deficit number and how the government goes about getting that. What's your hunch about where it'll come from? Like if you had to guess? I think borrowing, like, you know, both domestically and internationally, it'll probably come through that. Our fiscal deficit number is, you know, going up. I remember a time, like not too long ago, when we would look at a 4% fiscal deficit, fiscal deficit, fiscal deficit, fiscal deficit, fiscal deficit, fiscal deficit.","In this discussion, Nikhil Kamath talks about the budget announcement for 2022 from the perspective of an investor and an entrepreneur. He highlights the issue of the security transaction tax (STT), which is an indirect tax that traders have been paying for years. The STT makes the ecosystem inefficient and makes it hard for speculators and day traders to remain profitable. Nikhil also emphasizes the need to support full-time traders who are making the market for everybody and reducing the impact cost. He suggests that the government should remove STT or reduce it significantly. From an entrepreneur's perspective, Nikhil highlights the high taxation in India, which discourages entrepreneurship. He points out that taxation at such a high level reduces the net effective tax rate and makes it difficult for businesses to grow. He suggests that the government should lower the tax rate to encourage entrepreneurship."

Yeah, so a certain amount of goods and services are exported from India for which we get foreign money. And a certain amount is imported into India. The difference between the two is the deficit. So say for example, these numbers are not right. I'm just giving you an example. Say India and China does trade. India exports, sells maybe like 50 billion dollars worth of stuff to them. And we import about a 100 billion dollars from them. So that means the deficit is 50 billion dollars. Basically the money you're making from exporting things. Like the net money you're making from exporting things. Yeah, the net money you're making or losing, one or the other. So I think, you know, not long ago, like it used to be like 4% and it was a big deal. Like, you know, like why is it so high? Now I think they're factoring it for it to be at 6%. But since that money is going towards in-flow projects and development and all of that, people are not really contesting it too much. It'll be interesting to watch what happens. Broadly sector specifically, I think they did something good around education. They increased the budgets by 16 or 17%. Nothing really came for health care. One thing which was noticeable is they kept saying drone, drone, drone, right? Like a bunch of times. We had invested in a drone company recently called OmniPresent or something like that. And we're curious. We've been looking at that sector a little bit more closely ever since we got involved with that company. It'll be interesting. Then what else happened? You know, this memory is so short lived, right? Like budget, budget, budget was like Tuesday. And then by Wednesday, it was like budget two times instead of five. And by Thursday, you're like, what happened? Did anything really change? But substantially, I think these are the things which changed. Nothing materially changed outside of that.","The discussion is about the fiscal deficit in India, which is the difference between the amount of goods and services exported and the amount imported, resulting in either a net gain or loss of money. The deficit has been increasing and is currently around 6%. The budget had some increases in funding for education, but nothing significant for healthcare. The mention of drones multiple times in the budget has sparked interest in that sector. Overall, the budget did not bring about any major changes."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIRgrTFooZI_sep_1105_1374,mIRgrTFooZI_sep_1105_1374,"So I feel a finance person looks at it one way and you just gave us the finance person perspective on it. And then the mainstream and media and social media specifically look at it slightly differently. At the centre of social media there's been talk of crypto of course. And I know you have some strong opinions on crypto, both you and Nitin. I'd first love to know your general opinions on crypto and then your opinion on all the crypto related announcements that came from the budget. Yeah, sure. Let me preface by saying I am no crypto expert. I've been looking, commenting, trying to learn about it for many years. But I'm still no expert by anybody's measuring stick. I'm not. But I think what they're doing is confusing. When the parliamentary session was going on and she said, what would she use? Virtual assets are going to be taxed at 30 percent. So I looked at the document, the definition they have used for virtual assets is really broad. It's like, you know, if I send you a picture on your phone or some kind of a video of something I've done and I charge you some money for it, even that falls under virtual assets according to their definition, I think. That's my interpretation of it. The crypto guys are always half glass full kind of guys, right? Like anywhere that crypto is said by a government or somebody, a figure of authority, they're like, this is good news. At least they're acknowledging the fact that we exist and they will regulate in some form in the future. So they went in that direction. All the crypto exchanges, the big crypto guys, they thought it was good for them. But when I look at it, you know, for a crypto trader in India who was trading on listed exchanges in India, one month ago, if you made a hundred rupees of profit, you kept a hundred rupees of profit. Now, if you make a hundred rupees of profit, you get to keep 70 rupees of profit. So I don't I don't really quite understand how it is beneficial for them. Also, that one percent tedious on transactions, I think it makes it harder for the higher frequency traders, the market makers, for all of them to operate because they can't really, you know, pay that one percent tedious every time and be monitored at that level. So what I suspect will happen is the market will become less liquid very quickly for a short amount of time. Like if you went to, you know, if you tried to buy a certain crypto at a hundred bucks and your orders got filled at a hundred and one up until now, maybe in the really short term, it won't be hundred and one, but it will be hundred and one point five or two because of this tedious thing. She later came in. The finance minister later came and clarified that, you know, this is not the crypto bill. We have not legalized it. There will be a crypto bill which will talk about legalization and the regulatory aspect of it. So nothing materially changed. But in the current form, if things were to continue, I think one interesting opportunity opens up. Taxation on publicly listed equity is 10 percent LTCG. Here they're taxing people at 30 percent. I don't know if you've seen companies like MicroStrategy in America where their main business is no longer their main business, but there are there are proxy or a euphemized version of holding crypto assets and people buying to the company in order to, you know, have the crypto assets that the company has. So somebody might well open, you know, companies which are publicly listed tomorrow and give people the benefit of 10 percent taxation whilst their only business is investing in digital assets. And that's a nice arbitrage play, right? Because here you're paying 10 percent and there you're paying 30 percent. So it's there are many nuances to it. One will really have to like break down the numbers and figure out what happens in the future. But on the face of it, I think what materially changed is someone who was making 100 rupees one week ago, whenever this bill is active, will now make 70 rupees. I think the impact cost will be a little bit higher.","In this discussion, the speakers talk about the recent announcements related to cryptocurrency in India's budget. The definition used for virtual assets in the budget is seen as confusing and broad. Although many in the cryptocurrency community view any government acknowledgment of crypto as a positive step, the speakers question the impact of the new regulations on crypto traders in India. The new regulations will tax virtual assets at 30%, which is significantly higher than the 10% tax on publicly listed equity. The speakers suggest that this could lead to an arbitrage opportunity where companies invest in digital assets and offer the benefit of the 10% tax to investors. However, the speakers note that the impact cost may be higher, and it remains to be seen how these new regulations will affect the market in the long run."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIRgrTFooZI_sep_1374_1795,mIRgrTFooZI_sep_1374_1795,"So, you know, I liked what you said about how a lot of crypto folks look at it as, as any, look at any situation in the crypto world related to governments as positive. We've had a lot of crypto folks on the show and being an engineer, even I feel super positive. My whole generation feels super positive about crypto. But I actually want to hear the glass half empty version of it. In terms of you're someone who's made a lot of money in the stock market. I know for a fact that, you know, if you play the stock market game right, if you play the private equity market game right, you can actually make higher gains than the world of crypto has made. So people need to know that firstly. But secondly, what is your opinion on cryptocurrencies in general? Whether it's Bitcoin or Ethereum. I know you've studied it for a few years. That's longer than most of us have studied it for. And the fact that you're saying even you don't understand it, despite knowing so much about the world of money, it just makes me want to question that situation. Like, what's your take on it? Honestly, it's constantly changing. Like what I thought about crypto, like maybe one year ago, changed six months ago and is changing today and it will constantly evolve. It's such a fluid concept. Off late, I've been talking to people in the crypto world and they've tried to, you know, they've been explaining to me how, you know, proof of work was this proof of stake and proof of history works and the mechanisms behind cryptos and how a lot of different nuances work, which I did not know earlier. So I think one thing I can gather from people I've spoken to is nobody's really talking about it as a currency anymore, like they were two, three years ago. Everybody treats it as an asset today. Many people compare it to gold. I have watched debates where, you know, there is somebody arguing for gold on one side, somebody arguing for crypto on the other side. Valid arguments all. I personally find myself favoring the side of gold, favoring the more kind of like, you know, tried and tested means of allocating money just because of the history associated with them. You know, these are asset classes which have been around for thousands of years. And the one thing one cannot deny is, you know, there's everybody is attempted alchemy, right? Every king, ruler, emperor at one point or another has tried to make gold out of something else. Maybe there is a way to do it. Maybe nuclear fusion has some byproduct, which is gold, but it's a lot, lot more expensive to produce gold in that manner than it is to mine gold. So the price that gold is trading it today compared to the price that it the amount of money it takes to mine it, dig it from the ground and, you know, like process it and all of that is not considerably different. So there is some amount of like, you know, raw ingredients going into the process of creating the end product that is gold. Just for that reason, I do not think the value of gold will ever, can ever depreciate in the manner that the value of a cryptocurrency can. Like maybe the Bitcoin can fall 90% in one day because of some inadvertent, some weird event in the future. I don't think that can happen to gold. And for that reason, I really like gold. I've been looking at gold for a long time. And in terms of a hedge against inflation, it works incredibly well. If you look at it from, you know, what the median home price in America was in the 60s and how much gold you're required to buy a median house. Let's say, for example, it was 10 kilos in the 1980s, 20 years post that you probably needed 18 kilos. In the 2000s, you maybe needed 15 kilos. And today you probably need like 14 kilos. So gold has always been a good place to retain wealth. And in my experience, there's enough precedent for me to say that. When it comes to cryptocurrencies and, you know, Bitcoin, Ethereum and everything else that is popular, my little bit of research, okay, we try to like figure out who actually owns, let's talk about Bitcoin, who actually owns this asset class that everybody's talking about. So we looked at companies with large holdings. We looked at individuals with large holdings across the world. And we arrived at a number that about geographically, about 85 percent of the Bitcoin in the world sits in America. That number is probably increased after, you know, China having gone against it and Russia having gone against it and, you know, Kazakhstan and Ukraine and all of that. So I would assume that 85 percent has become even more. We talk about this as a currency which is democratizing in a manner. But when you look at it, I think, you know, it's the same like a couple of hundred people who have access to the vast majority of this currency or they've kind of like collated it with time. That argument doesn't hold true for me either then, you know, like it's just like, there are so many moving parts, Ranveer, like I have to figure out like, should one buy and why one should buy? See, if I were to like, you know, tell you like the top line thing that I think with crypto, I'm like, am I going to like lose out so much by not holding it today versus taking the risk when it's a regulatory gray and the volatility associated with it. You know, the fact that it has rallied as much as it has and all of that. I'm more on the side of, you know, it's okay. Like, you know, you don't need to be a part of every party in town and maybe this one is not for you. Do you own any crypto? No, we can't like see the thing is we're so regulated as a business, right? From everybody from like RBI, from SEBI and we are under a microscope all the time because as we have scaled, we have had very many people who have been kind of like, you know, who have lost a lot of business because of us doing the same service at a much cheaper cost. You know, there were brokers back in the day, we charged 2% a transaction and we charged 1.99% of that or something like that. So we've always like, we probably have like, you know, a lot more compliance and governance checks than anybody. So as long as they don't totally legalize it in the country, I would never even, you know, flirt with the idea of ever buying a crypto coin. Wow.","The discussion is about cryptocurrencies and gold as investment options. The speaker suggests that the concept of cryptocurrencies is constantly evolving, and nobody talks about it as a currency anymore. Instead, people treat it as an asset, and many compare it to gold. However, the speaker favors gold over cryptocurrencies due to its history and the fact that it requires raw materials to produce. The speaker also mentions that while cryptocurrencies are considered democratizing, a small number of individuals and companies hold the vast majority of them. The speaker concludes by saying that there are many moving parts to consider when deciding whether to invest in cryptocurrencies and why one should buy them."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIRgrTFooZI_sep_1795_1935,mIRgrTFooZI_sep_1795_1935,"Okay, you know when it comes to crypto, so last week we had some smart people on the show, we had this econ grad, we had Ayush Jaiswal from Pesto, and I spoke to them about this concept of money. Now again, I'm speaking to the TRS listeners here. Basically, the value of money is because of the value of gold. As in like when I'm giving you one dollar, I'm saying that I'm giving you one dollar's worth of gold. I mean, at least that used to be the case. Now I'm giving you one dollar's worth of A dollar. Now it's just debt. That used to be the case before like, I think, you know the gold standard existed up until like, if I'm not wrong again, I don't remember, but 1971. 70, yeah. Up until that time, everybody, every central bank across the world had to show how much gold they have in their reserves, right? It kind of like mutated from there to a point where United States held everybody's gold, or a lot of countries' gold, whoever were part of the pro-US group. And 1971, Nixon was doing two things. He was trying to send somebody to the moon. Cold war with Russia. They were on this crazy race, who will go to the moon first? And they were fighting a war with Vietnam on the other side. So he came out and he said, on a temporary basis, we will not show you how much gold is in our federal reserve. So when he changed it, it was temporary. It's just that people have not gone back to it. Ever since then, you know, it's this arbitrary thing, right? Like we all, we treat the US dollar as like a place to hide when things get risky in the market. We all believe that it can never fail. But if you look back in history, you know, people thought about the pound in the same way. And in the 90s, George Soros kind of like, you know, went against the pound and beat it down, right? Like anything can happen. The amount of money these guys have printed in the last, you know, 18 months out of thin air, essentially is more than all the currency US markets have printed ever in the history. So with that much dollar, will there be a considerable serious threat to the dollar at some point in the future? I would say very possible.","The discussion is about the value of money and how it used to be based on the value of gold, but now it's just based on debt. The gold standard used to exist until 1971, where every central bank had to show how much gold they had in their reserves. However, Nixon temporarily stopped showing how much gold was in the federal reserve due to other priorities such as sending someone to the moon and fighting in Vietnam. Since then, people have treated the US dollar as a safe haven, but it's not guaranteed to never fail, as seen with the pound in the 90s. The amount of money printed in the last 18 months out of thin air is more than all the currency US markets have ever printed, which poses a serious threat to the dollar's value in the future."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIRgrTFooZI_sep_1935_1991,mIRgrTFooZI_sep_1935_1991,"So, okay, I'd love for you to draw a dystopian scenario. Firstly, again, starting from the ABCs. So, early on, the value of your currency as a nation depended on how much gold you had in your federal bank. Then in 1971, when Nixon announced this, they said that... There was one more scenario, it was called the Bretton Woods system. So, for a while, we went on this system across the world where all our currencies were pegged to the dollar. So, there was a Bretton Woods meeting, people sat down and they decided... Okay, you're the Chinese Remnibbi. The dollar is X, you can be 5% plus X of the conversion ratio or you can be 5% minus X and you can't drift outside of it. So, we had the Bretton Woods system, we had the gold standard and then now we have the fiat currencies and you know... Essentially, what you're thinking of as currency is debt, government debt. Okay, could you explain this little more?","The discussion is about the history of currencies and how they have evolved over time. The value of currencies used to be based on how much gold a nation had in its federal bank. In 1971, Nixon changed this by temporarily suspending the requirement for central banks to show how much gold they had in reserve. This led to the current system of fiat currencies, where the value of money is based on government debt. The conversation then moves on to a dystopian scenario where the current monetary system collapses, and the possible implications of such a scenario."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIRgrTFooZI_sep_1991_2191,mIRgrTFooZI_sep_1991_2191,"If you have to explain it to a 10 year old, how would you explain it? Yeah, sure. So... The concept of Fiat money, okay, this is quite like... I think the people who created the concept... who look at it in its current form today will not understand it themselves, right? It pretty much makes no sense. How do I explain it? Maybe using metaphors. Metaphors are the best way to explain. Yeah. Yeah. So, let's say the US government is earning 100 rupees a year. They're spending, let's say, 300 rupees a year. This balance 200 rupees is coming from somewhere. They sell debt. The government takes debt. You know, they call it treasury bonds. Depending on the duration of the debt, there are many different kinds of debt in the US. They'll give you 1.8%, 1.6%, whatever, for buying this debt for a 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 year period. And in turn, they service whatever the excessive spending in the country is. They've been doing this for a long time. So, every year, incrementally, the debt pile kind of piles up and it grows. Now, at the current point, the Federal Reserve kind of like, you know, has so much debt on its hands that even a tiny tweak like, you know, to curtail inflation, they're saying of late that 6% inflation in America, right? If it were to go up to 7% and they have to raise interest rates to above inflation to try and contain it, nobody knows what will happen to this debt, right? But it works in a weird way because we all kind of... Okay, good metaphor. Think of it as a religion. Yeah. Think America is the biggest religion in the world today. China is contesting it at some level. We are all devotees and followers of the US religion. As long as America, the religion, continues to have followers and people who have faith in it and perceive that, you know, they're a safe place for everything, like in terms of money and economics, they will continue to thrive. It's like a self-fulfilling prophecy. It doesn't matter. They can go out and print how much ever currency they want. Their currency will not depreciate. They can do physical things. They can do whatever they want. They can do fiscally really imprudent stuff. All of that will work as long as the followers who the rest of the countries are continue to buy US debt, continue to kind of like not contest the dollar and stuff like that. You know, that's actually a great metaphor even for cryptocurrencies. I think Bitcoin is a religion. These currencies gain strength from the size of their followership. What Bitcoin is today is because of all the early adopters and followers who are so devoted to it and you know, like constantly championing the cause. And I think that gives it the strength. The more there is a new cryptocurrency and it has more followers, that will become the new religion.","The discussion is about explaining the concept of fiat money, government debt, and the current financial system to a 10-year-old using metaphors. The speakers use the example of the US government's excessive spending, selling debt in the form of treasury bonds, and piling up debt over time. They also compare the concept of fiat money to a religion, where the US dollar is the biggest religion in the world and gains strength from its followership. The discussion also touches on the concept of cryptocurrencies and how they gain strength from their followership, similar to a religion."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIRgrTFooZI_sep_2191_2389,mIRgrTFooZI_sep_2191_2389,"But isn't that like kind of the core definition of money? That all of us got together and said, okay, these notes with these numbers and faces printed on them are worth something. So when enough people believe about it, automatically it becomes money. Therefore, on a more macro scale, that's what you're saying about America. Where every other country leaving a few countries, like probably the enemy countries say like China, Russia or whatever, are saying that no, that's the country which is our gold standard. But you're saying, and this makes me dial back the conversation a bit, you said that things might implode there. So that's where I ask you to draw out a dystopian scenario as a finance professional. What will that be? Is it possible to predict a timeline? Is it like, you know, say if it does happen, say if that all that stuff implodes, what will be the outcomes of it for the United States of America and for all the other countries who would say that that's our religion? Very hard to like, you know, picture it. It'll be scary for sure, right? Like, you know, we all have so much US debt, like, you know, the Chinese used to have the largest, they've been offloading in the last one year and now Japan has the highest US debt. So, you know, these guys will not get their money back, obviously. In turn, when you're saying US debt, it's basically bonds that we have bought from the US government, like the Chinese government will buy bonds from the US. Yeah. Like I was talking to you, those bonds which give 1.7, 1.8%, right? Like stuff like that. So, A, these companies will, these countries will suddenly not get that money which was receivable to them for a long time. In turn, they will not be able to service their own internal debt and many, many implications, right? It's a crazy scenario. What happens... The way the world is going, it looks like we're creating two blocks, right? You know, the West, India is on the side of the West. On this side, you have Russia, China and Iran and a bunch of other countries which are natural resource rich in their own way. You know, these countries like Russia and all, suddenly they will do so much better because crude has rallied like 100%. Like, you know, if one were to predict, like it's such a meta thing to think, but because of the Russia-Ukraine fight and, you know, they've not actually started fighting really, but all the narrative around it, the biggest beneficiary in turn might also have been Russia because they're such a big oil exporter. That sense that there might be conflict drove oil prices up and, you know, they benefited from it. Like, when you think about it, like, you know, it's so complex. Say the world of oil, for example. You know, we have OPEC and we have this governing body which defines supply and how much has put out and how to control price and all of that. But if tomorrow one were to go out and realise that, you know, Russia kind of like did a lot of this to just get oil prices up and, you know, they have a lot of sanctions and there isn't much other revenue coming their way right now, it would be incredible, right? It would be such an unintuitive thing to think. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.","The discussion is about the concept of money, specifically the idea that money gains its value from people's belief in it. The speakers talk about the US dollar being the world's biggest currency and how it gains strength from the belief of its followers. They also discuss the potential consequences if this belief were to falter, such as countries not receiving the money they are owed in the form of US bonds and being unable to service their own internal debt. The conversation touches on the idea of a dystopian scenario where the world is split into two blocks, with Russia, China, and Iran on one side and the West on the other. The speakers speculate on the potential implications of conflict in the oil market and how it could impact various countries."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIRgrTFooZI_sep_2389_2816,mIRgrTFooZI_sep_2389_2816,"Again, coming back to India, what does this mean for the future of our country? If we are on that West block and say this happens, what will happen to our country and how do you look at kind of the future of our country again as a finance professional, keeping in mind this budget, all the budgets of the recent past, where are we going, you know, from a geopolitical perspective and just from a growth perspective? So Ranveer, I feel like there is no way to really look that far into the future. I feel like we've been lucky, right, like me and you and the era that we're living in today. Like, you know, we were not in the world war, world, first world war in the 1900s or 1910 or 14 or whenever it started. We missed the Nazi thing. We missed socialism in a way. We were not around for Mao and Stalin and all these crazy people who have come about and lived around us. We've lived in such a friendly world, like even if you look at average age of people, like, you know, like how long people live for. I think if you even go back like 78 years ago, people only lived for like 50 years. If you go back another 20 years, they would probably live for like 35 years. That was the normal term of somebody's life. We're in this very lucky place where nothing drastic has happened in the last 30, 40 years that we've been around. I just hope and pray nothing drastic happens for the next 30, 40 years. What happens beyond that? A, I'm dead. B, it is impossible to predict. Impossible. Like, I would love to, you know, fire them a guess and say which way geopolitical stuff will go. But, you know, I think nobody knows. I wouldn't be hard pressed in saying even probably the leaders of Russia or, you know, like America, they don't know themselves. They also have like one five year term or four year term and then they're gone, right? I mean, there are exceptions like Putin and all that, but nobody really knows. At the end of the day, it requires like three, four mad people to do three, four stupid things and everything could go down. Are you optimistic about the near future? Like in terms of... I'm optimistic about our life, our life term. Like I'm optimistic about the next 30, 40 years. I don't think much will happen. I hope I'm right. So things will go the same way. Maybe you could put an angle of philosophy into this and say that because of Shark Tank becoming mainstream in India, entrepreneurship will come to the forefront. There'll be entrepreneurs in India, lots of business creators, lots of job creators. Hey, one thing, you know, there's so much critique for, you know, the BJP government and the prime minister and all of that. One thing you have to give them credit for is we have at the end of the day had like 40, 50 unicorns in India, right? Like in one year to have created an ecosystem where companies could thrive like that, to have created, you know, access to capital has never been easy, right? Like 30 years ago, this was impossible. Or 15 years ago, this was impossible. India has become more attractive to so many foreign investors at some level because of consistency at the top, at the center. And I think they have played a part in it. So, you know, a lot of critique is past their way. But this one thing, the stability that they've maintained in the last 10 years, I think eight years, we have to kind of give them credit for that. Yeah, which is why I've rarely heard anyone from the world of finance really critiquing the government in terms of their economic policies, at least. Like I hear a lot of people saying exactly what you said. And, you know, the realistic scenario is that there's no political competition to them. So it's likely that they will be in power for a while, which, you know, from a capitalistic perspective, at least it means a lot of glory. If there were 40 unicorns last year, God alone knows how many unicorns will be built over the next five years. I personally feel that definitely content affects culture and people are underestimating how important a role Shark Tank has played in making entrepreneurship a dinner table conversation. So for the kids who are 10 years, 15 years younger than me, dude, it's going to be so easy for them to get into becoming business people. It was so difficult for me to convince my parents. All my co-founders had trouble convincing their parents to get into business. And I'm sure that this is the story for so many young Indian kids. The big hope is that more people step into the world of business. But coming back to the finance side of things here, I asked the finance professional in you that is it correct to say that if a country creates more businesses and say we actually start selling to the world, is it great for India? I mean, I know it's an obvious answer, but I'd love for you to detail that out a little more. Like what happens? Yeah, of course. See, we've been fairly competitive in many industries, right? Like in India, I'm talking from a global standpoint. Take pharmaceuticals, for example, take IT services in India. China has been great at manufacturing for a long, long time now. Many things play a part in this, but the fact that, you know, cost of labor is significantly cheaper here in our country compared to the West plays a big part in it. You know, that's why a lot of outsourcing. I'm not taking anything away from the skilled labor and all the efficiencies that we had, but at some level, people started coming here first, outsourcing their services to India because of the cost of labor. You know, the Chinese, for a long time, people used to keep saying that the remnib is artificially deflated, so they become more competitive. So from one perspective, if India's currency were to depreciate like it has been in the last 10 years, not so much in the last one or two years, but otherwise we lose about 4-4.5% to the dollar in terms of relative value. One could argue that further depreciation will make us more efficient from an export lens and make us more competitive in a global scenario. But I think, you know, the big problem in India right now is upskilling labor, improving education. I think that low tier export that we do as the country develops will become less relevant. We will really kind of like, you know, have to shore up our, you know, kind of like the education system in India, provide really skilled services and high end, kind of like move up the value chain. I think that's the future for India. So basically if we focus on India, we're going to have a lot of opportunities So basically if we focus on education, we focus on upskilling, you're creating a workforce for all the businesses that are going to be created over the next 10 to 15 years. And overall, like successful capitalists along with their teams will drive the growth of the country. That's basically a good case scenario for what you're saying.","The discussion covers various topics but primarily focuses on the future of India from a finance perspective. The speakers agree that it is impossible to predict the future and that they are optimistic about the next 30-40 years. They discuss the rise of entrepreneurship in India, thanks to Shark Tank, and the creation of an ecosystem where companies can thrive. The stability that the current government has maintained over the years is also praised for making India more attractive to foreign investors. They discuss how creating more businesses and selling to the world would be great for India's economy. The importance of content affecting culture and making entrepreneurship a dinner table conversation is also emphasized."

So, we do it from a 360 degree perspective. So, you know, I feel kind of one thing I've learnt about looking at countries from a macro lens is that you got to perceive it like a business. You have things that are going right. You can be optimistic, but you've also got to focus on what the holes within the boat are. What are the holes that are supposed to be plugged? What can possibly go wrong? So again, from the finance lens, what do you think are the problems that we're facing and what do we need to fix? If I have to put them in like a couple of broad categories, let's do like three or four. I would say inflation, unemployment, fiscal deficit. Yeah, I think these three are like probably in my view, big problems of today. Inflation, people often don't realise. You know, I was reading this book by Milton Friedman a few days ago, very like, very creative, colourful character. He was an economist who kind of like championed in a certain way the laissez-faire form of governance where less involvement is better than more involvement and stuff like that. But he talks about inflation as a tax, you know, when your purchasing power goes down. Officially, we think inflation in India is 6%, you know, between 5 to 6%. Pragmatically living on the ground in India, it feels like a lot more. You know, steel, copper, crude, all these commodities have rallied by 50, 100%, taking up the cost of, you know, like goods being produced in the country and many, many other things. So much more expensive than they were three, four years ago. So inflation, like even if you look at housing price inflation, I think that alone is significantly higher than that 5, 6% number that we keep hearing. But if you were to consider inflation at, say, 10%, for example, you have to think that your purchasing power in the country is going down by 10%. Like if Ranbir has 10 lakh rupees in his bank account this year, he can buy maybe a car which costs 10 lakhs. But next year, that same car costs 11 lakhs and you can't afford it with that same 10 lakh rupees. If you put your money in a bank FD in India today, you get 4, 4.5% pre-tax. Net of taxes you probably make like 3%. With inflation being so much higher than 3%, people are effectively losing their purchasing power every year that money remains parked in their bank accounts. I think this will have many repercussions in the future. Once it kind of blows out of proportion and it becomes uncontrolled and it's rising quickly, the government will have to quickly move interest rates above the inflation rates. So let's assume inflation goes to 10, interest rates will have to become 12. We've been in this easy money scenario for a few years now and so much borrowing has happened towards Capex and other activity. A. It will become increasingly hard for these people who have borrowed to service their debt. B. Companies will find it very hard to go out and borrow at 15-20% to grow their businesses and have any kind of Capex activity. Inflation is a big headwind in my opinion. We've kind of like, I think we've spoken about the problem, but we have not really given it the amount of attention it is due for as big a problem as it is. The second thing I was talking about is unemployment. I think last month's number in India came at about 8%, which was the highest we have seen in the recent past. When somebody hears 8% unemployment, they think, okay, there are 16 people here, 8 people don't have a job, 92 are working. But it's not like that, right? They don't consider people under the age of 15, they don't consider people over the age of 60, they don't consider... There are many more categories. You have to be educated wanting to get a job and like willingly unemployed kind of a thing. So when they say 8%, the real number is significantly higher, like, you know, like many times higher, the actual unemployment on the ground. And geographically, it's very dispersed. So Karnataka, for example, or Maharashtra might have 2% unemployment, but say Haryana or Punjab might have 25%. Bihar might have a huge number. UP might have a big number. Historically, like if you go back in time, this is probably the biggest benchmark to when society kind of revolves. Like you were talking earlier about, you know, in many cases, people going after people who are publicly kind of like have known to done well monetarily or financially. In a certain way, it's testament to that as well, because a huge section of society is kind of not doing as well as they should be today. You know, like between us, like, you know, we all are so lucky to have been born where we are born, to whom we were born, the fact that we had access to education, the fact that we could go to a school. You know, I'm not saying anybody's affluent or stuff like that, but you know, you still had the opportunity to go to school. You had the opportunity to, you know, like go to a hospital and stuff like that. So we're that tiny lucky minority in the company in a way. And the vast majority of the country is still struggling on many of those domains. So unemployment has the potential of becoming a daily big problem. The third thing maybe we can talk about is the birth rate. You know, like in society, every couple has to give birth to 2.1 kids for the population of the country to remain stagnant. In the recent census which came out, I can't remember all the numbers, but the headline number has gone below 2.1 in India. Karnataka, for example, is 1.7. I think Maharashtra is 1.8, 1.9. States like Bihar, U.P. are higher, closer to 2.83, where the population will continue to grow. But that whole argument about how India's population will continue to grow up and double is gone now. I think as maybe in the next 20, 30, 40 years, we will get to that point where population starts to dwindle. You know, it's happening in China now. They removed the one-child policy and now they're encouraging people to have two kids and more kids because it's become a really hard problem for them. The one good learning when it comes to population is I think from countries like Japan who have lived this cycle earlier. When fertility rates go down as quickly as they have in India, you will have this 30, 40, 50 year period where you have a really high chance of getting pregnant. So it's a really big portion of your population, which is in that unproductive age range like between 60 to 80, which needs to be supported. The average age in India today has maybe gone up from 24 to 28 or 30. But when it goes to 40, when it goes to 50 or when you have this huge population, which is not productive in society in the traditional sense, it will be a huge strain on the economy. You can't expect an older economy like that to grow at 8, 9, 10 percent. We've seen it in Japan in the last few decades where there's barely been any growth. So we might enter a phase like that. It has many repercussions for different ecosystems across like, you know, take real estate, for example. We were always told that limited resource, limited land, always increasing number of people. So the price of real estate will go up. Tomorrow, if the number of people is no longer going up or is going down, does that does that argument reverse? Hmm. We expected urbanization to happen in India like it did in China. We used them as a benchmark in some sense. But does something change in the people's minds where, you know, people are no longer as you know, I think farming is aggregating, right? That will happen. Like smaller farmers will kind of like fold in. We'll have bigger farms with more technology and equipment and all of that. But does that then definitely mean urbanization? I don't know. I think it'll be interesting to wait and watch. But this birth rate issue, you know, I think will become a really big issue for India in the next 30, 40, 50 years. And it'll affect many, many industries. Yes, I would say these three things are, you know, like probably on the top of my head, the biggest things to worry about right now. So, I mean, I won't really talk about the third issue you spoke about because that's kind of out of our control. Unless we build biotech based businesses and f**k it up in a black mirror way where we enhance human youth. But maybe let's address the first two realistic problems. The first one you spoke about, especially inflation.","The discussion highlights some of the negative aspects of the Indian economy and identifies inflation, unemployment, and fiscal deficit as big problems. Inflation is described as a tax that reduces purchasing power, and the real rate of inflation is believed to be higher than official estimates. The high inflation rate will make it difficult for companies to borrow at high interest rates, hindering CapEx activities. Unemployment is also a significant issue, and the actual rate is much higher than the official number. Unemployment is not evenly distributed across regions, with some states having much higher rates than others. Overall, the Indian economy faces significant challenges that require attention and action to address."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIRgrTFooZI_sep_3502_4113,mIRgrTFooZI_sep_3502_4113,"Coming back to realistic finance conversations, because this is a finance podcast Mr. Khamat. What about the inflation issue? Like how do you actually, how does one tackle that? I mean, obviously one can't, but I'm speaking as, you know, for the government. See, what does the finance ministry do about that issue going forward? Well, honestly, you know, a lot of the inflation issues across the world have been percolating down from the federal reserve printing money in America. So not like we have much control, you know, if you go back to economic theory, there's a guy called John Maynard Keynes, he had the Keynesian model. If you were to take two contrasting viewpoints, right? Keynes believed in when things are not going well, throw money, helicopter money, pump so much money in the economy, increase consumption, that in turn will lead to growth in one way or the other. There was another guy, Friedrich Hayek on the other side. Hayek always, you know, was more air on the side of caution, you know, like the complete opposite of what Keynes was saying in a certain way. The world largely, the capitalistic world largely, or the democratic world largely has followed the Keynesian model. And I don't know if there's a solution for it. I think, you know, to be, to make the cost of capital higher and to reduce liquidity from the ecosystem is probably the only prudent way to make sure it's in check. Like, you know, otherwise, you know, we'll go like the way of Turkey or something. I don't know if you've been watching what's been happening with Turkey, but you know, it's like batshit crazy, right? Like Erdogan does not believe in increasing interest rates. Immaterial of where inflation is at. So, you know, inflation could be well at 20, 30, 40%, but he still wants to lend money to people at nominal rates, like one fifth of that. So inflation continues to grow up, go up. The currency has deflated by 70%, 60, 70%. And it's total chaos, right? Like, I don't think we can go in that direction. I think the reasonable world that we live in, India, the only tool they will really have is raising interest rates and reducing liquidity when inflation goes up. And I think we will see a cycle of that in the near future. Got it. What was the second one you had mentioned? You had said inflation, the birth rate, and unemployment. Right, unemployment was. So have you heard of this thing called the Japanese economic miracle? It's basically after World War II, how they bounced back. And I kind of studied it for a video that I wanted to write once upon a time. And what I figured is it was just highly effective productivity hacks that they used, but on a much more macro scale. So the government said that every business is going to follow these systems. And they were basically productivity hacks, that you'll meet so many times in a week, you will try doing business with sister companies, you'll grow as an ecosystem rather than one company. Do you think that kind of where India is, we should be inspired by the South Koreas and Japans of the last 50 years and take things forward to take this 40 unicorns a year thing to 400 unicorns a year? Yeah, yeah. I mean, it's interesting you say that. Adam Smith used to say that if we as individuals or we as companies, we all act in our own interest, in a selfish way almost, together as a unit, we do better, right? Like he was again a very interesting guy in what he believed in. But I don't know if the Japanese model will work for India. I think we are so big in terms of scale and the problem is so acute that the only real way to kind of like do anything with unemployment is probably like really shore up education. A contrary opinion to that would be something like UBI, universal basic income has to become a reality sooner than later. I think not just in India, but across the world, capitalism is like that, right? We want to move, see socialism doesn't work, communism doesn't work, we know that, but we need to move from capitalism to some form of benevolent capitalism with not just benevolence, but also checks and rules in place like inheritance tax and property tax to make sure society on the whole is okay. Wealth disparity has become such a big issue today that if you were to go back in time and there's plenty of precedent for this, right? Like if 20 people in a community of 100 people own 90% of the assets, the community can survive. But if one person holds 99% of the community's assets, the other 99 will go after him with sickles to take what he has away. I think we're going in that direction. We're kind of like crawling in that direction and it is a real issue. But I think the only solution for that is A, taxing in a more efficient manner and B, using the tax money efficiently to, you know, create a good model where people who do not have a job are still taken care of in a certain way. Okay. So Nikhil, before heading into the last section, keeping in mind this previous section that we've just spoken about, say hypothetically someone makes you the finance minister for a year, like, you know, Anil Kapoor in Nayak kind of situation for you. Yeah. But I'm not asking you the details, right? I'm not gonna tell you, ask you like, which policy are you going to create? Generally, what would be the three or four things in your mind in terms of, okay, these are the tweaks I want to make to take the country forward. I would focus more on transaction taxes versus income taxes, because I feel like that 1% of the country, which is paying income tax, I don't think you should burden them anymore. I mean, I think, you know, this is not even the rich, right? There's like the middle class who are essentially getting a salary and paying most amount of their income as tax. I was doing some kind of a calculation, and I was like, if India were to abolish income tax and instead try to increase GST to make up for that, how much will GST have to go up by? And in my calculation, it was something like 26, 25% or something, so if you're buying a car, it will cost you 25% more, but you're not paying any income tax. But net-net, I think what a positive result of that would be is not only that 1% will pay tax, but a vast majority, not majority, but a big number in our country, which has evaded tax, found ways to put that money in property and things like that. They will come under the tax net, and net-net collections will go up significantly. Maybe that's something to look at. Property taxes, yeah, definitely. You know, if you live in America and Connecticut, for example, you would pay as much as 200 pips, 2% a year in property taxes, right? Like if you have this large villa, if you have a mansion, you can afford it. Why not pay a considerable amount of tax on it? In India, that concept does not exist. Again, from the point of view of tax evasion, I think taxing property across the board will bring a lot more people under the tax net. See, there's a common narrative in all that I'm saying, right? I don't think the solution is to tax that poor 1% any more than we have already, but get more people to pay tax. You know, I would say a very controversial thing that a lot of people will not like, but I think farm income has to be taxed beyond a certain point. I totally am on board with supporting the smaller farmers who are not doing well and need to be helped and all of that. But let's say the cap is 10 crore rupees. If a farmer earns more than 10 crore rupees a year, he has to pay tax. I don't think that hurts anybody. You know, I feel like companies like Monsanto, like these huge agritech companies, there are cases in which they're earning 200, 300 crores of profit a year, but they're not paying this tax and they're using this exemption to get out of paying tax. It just seems ridiculous to me. So from the taxation perspective, I would do everything. Also inheritance tax. I think there's precedent for that. You know, the US has inheritance tax, UK has estate taxes, South Korea, Southeast Asian countries, everybody has it, right? The good thing about it is you pay inheritance tax once in your lifetime and you're not burdened with paying it every year, so it doesn't discourage entrepreneurship in a manner that increasing income taxes which are paid every year might do. But the general narrative around taxation in my mind is to get a broader section of society to pay tax. See, beyond a point, you can't even blame the government for a lot of the infra that we have and stuff like that because if you have to face it, 1% of the tax that is collected is not enough and they don't really have the gunpowder to go there and go out there and really transform the country. So yeah, general message and narrative is around getting more people to pay tax. And avoiding taxes, avoiding taxes, avoiding taxes, avoiding taxes, avoiding taxes, avoiding taxes.","The discussion covers three topics, inflation, unemployment, and productivity. The speakers talk about the causes and solutions of inflation and the role of government in controlling it. They also discuss the Japanese economic miracle and whether India can follow a similar model to increase productivity. The speakers touch upon the issue of wealth disparity and suggest solutions such as taxing more efficiently and using tax money to take care of unemployed people. The conversation ends with a hypothetical question on what the speaker would do if they were made the finance minister for a year."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6fSq40kdIE_sep_53_214,C6fSq40kdIE_sep_53_214,"Coronavirus, I wanna first highlight the fact that my industry has benefited a lot from it, which is the content industry, because people are sitting at home watching YouTube, watching Netflix, reading Twitter, things like that. So, we as content creators have been told to generate a lot of content, but we can't because very soon public transportation in Mumbai is gonna shut down. But all the other industries are... Taking a hit? Yeah, like... It's taking a hit. Like I know, you were just in my office right before this podcast, and you got a call from someone at your office saying... Yeah, I got a message actually saying all government offices are going to be shut, and since my work involves liaising with some government departments, work is stopped. Yeah, so what kind of impact has it had on the industries other than the content industry? I mean, it's pretty far reaching, it's like... You're reorganizing the conditions under which these markets operate, right? Now, suddenly if a lot more people are going to stay at home, and you know, the dynamics of people change. So like you said, content... If they're going to stay at home and be able to work from home, content is going to be a big thing. But stuff like... Travel, manufacturing, trading, a lot of those things. Travel, airlines and all, especially have taken such a huge hit. Yeah, you tell me about the banks in USA. Oh yeah, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates. So usually what that means is when they cut interest rates too, I think it's a range of 0 to 0.25%. Can you break that down a little more for the viewers? So, what it means is when they cut interest rates, it's the cost of borrowing money is going down. Okay. If I charge you a lower interest rate, it's easier for you to borrow because you have to pay me less interest. So, what the Federal Reserve in the US has done is, they've reduced the interest so much, they want people to borrow, they want new business, they want people to spend. Has it gone down to 0? It's a... So, it's usually it's the overnight rate, so the Fed gives to banks and it's a long mechanism. But this is one of the biggest cuts that they've had in a long time. And the US market, like it's the biggest sell-off that they've had since 2008. I think Monday was the biggest sell-off. What do you mean biggest sell-off? Because of... people thinking that business is going to take such a big hit and things in especially certain parts of the world will come to a standstill. People want to sell stocks of businesses which they think are going to take a hit because of this. Which is almost every business to be fair. So, even in India, so there's something called a circuit in a financial market, in a stock market. If too many people start selling stocks and the price starts dropping really fast, they halt trading for a bit. It's called hitting a circuit. They want everyone to calm down and you know, reassess and take it from there. So, that's happened. It's rare for these things to happen in markets. And also, I have been told that this is also the right time to buy certain shares. Like again, in the content industry, I just had one of my mentors actually talking about how you should totally invest in OTT platforms like Netflix, like Disney, like a hotstar, a hotstar, a hotstar.","The content industry has benefited greatly from the pandemic as people are staying at home and consuming more media. However, other industries like travel, manufacturing, and trading have taken a hit. The Federal Reserve in the US has cut interest rates to encourage borrowing and spending, but this has led to the biggest sell-off in the US stock market since 2008. India's stock market has also been affected, with trading being halted due to a circuit. It's a good time to invest in certain shares, such as OTT platforms like Netflix and Disney+."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6fSq40kdIE_sep_214_330,C6fSq40kdIE_sep_214_330,"going forward because what's gonna happen now is people are staying at home, they're gonna discover a lot of stuff on Netflix. The content that was already there is gonna get discovered now. Definitely. And people will continue watching it even after the situation like leaves us. That's what it is right, it's a change in social dynamics. Usually if I am as a consumer in the economy, if I am spending on certain things that involve me going out with my friends and going to a bar or going to a restaurant. It's my spending is now redirected. Maybe I can spend more, maybe I'll buy another subscription because I don't have things to do. So clearly it's a reorganization which means that some things will definitely benefit. Like you're saying streaming platforms would benefit. People were talking about hygiene products, people that manufacture those. So all these things that are needed now. What other products do you think will benefit? People were talking about soaps, people were talking about like hand sanitizers, Dettol, there's shortages of Dettol everywhere. General sanitation products I feel given that one of the precautions to be taken is washing your hands and maintaining good hygiene. The e-commerce industry has gone up a lot. Definitely, mobility has stopped. People are basically buying a lot more products online. They don't want to go to physical retail stores to purchase because they don't want to get infected. And you know for example, we have Uber, Ola, we have like you know, ride sharing platforms, they're going to take a hit. If people are on lockdown and on quarantine, they can't travel. And so the people a lot of the times, these guys are contractors, they work with Uber and then they're going to have a tough time with their livelihood especially. But governments are helping out. It's not that the market is being left to its own devices. There have been aid packages for airlines all over the world. For you know, helping I think... What do you mean aid packages? Like the government comes in? The government is helping them because suddenly it's not a normal circumstance, right? Like usually now we're heading into spring summer, which is when the world vacations and travels but this time, no airlines aren't going to go anywhere. Plus there are travel bans. If flights coming in from Europe aren't allowed into the US, there's going to be no flights back from the US to Europe, right? Things like that. So there's going to be an impact. Hopefully, you know, things will smooth out and start going back to normal soon.","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant shift in social dynamics, with people staying at home and spending more time on streaming platforms like Netflix. This has led to a redirection of spending towards products like hygiene and sanitation products, as well as an increase in e-commerce as people avoid physical retail stores. However, industries like ride-sharing platforms have taken a hit due to mobility restrictions. Governments have provided aid packages to affected industries like airlines to help them cope with the economic impact of the pandemic."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6fSq40kdIE_sep_330_404,C6fSq40kdIE_sep_330_404,"specifically about the e-commerce industry, we actually have one of our business mentors, Mr. Manish Chaudhary. He runs Wow Skin Science, which is one of the biggest FMCG brands in India, it's an upcoming brand. He did well on Amazon till now, like really well, they've built out the entire brand through Amazon. But because Amazon itself has got such a big boost, people are spending more time on the internet. Right. His brand was already big there, so it's taken off to an other level. He's doing really well, like you know, that's the effect it's had on his business. Coming back to the content side of things, more specifically, e-gaming. Dude, yesterday I think Tanmay posted on his Twitter, he got something like half a million live viewers at like one time. There were 500k kids watching him play a video game. Okay, so we both watch football, right? And football, most sports, if you're a fan of the NBA or a fan of the Premier League, everything has stopped. European football completely stopped. Players are streaming Fortnite. I think there was a Macedozole stream on Fortnite a couple of days ago. So, it's people... Everyone needs something to do with their time, right? And given that we can't interact with each other face to face or have to, you know, have some kind of social distancing. Like things that let you connect to someone from a distance, whether that's in a community form or one to one, those things will definitely...","The discussion is about the impact of the current situation on the finance industry, with a focus on e-commerce. The e-commerce industry is experiencing a significant boost as people are spending more time online and are hesitant to go to physical retail stores due to the risk of infection. Wow Skin Science, one of the biggest FMCG brands in India, has benefited from this boost, as it has built out its entire brand through Amazon. The discussion also touches on e-gaming, which has seen a surge in popularity as people look for ways to occupy their time while practicing social distancing. Finally, the discussion mentions the impact on the travel industry, with aid packages being provided by governments to help airlines cope with the situation."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6fSq40kdIE_sep_404_581,C6fSq40kdIE_sep_404_581,"But I'll tell you what else as content creators right now I remember Viraj just called me last night, okay my manager and he told me that dude listen the content industry is on a big boom, you better be creating a lot more content. So I called my team in today I think we're three or four of the only people in this entire building. Yeah. Like including all of us recording here. Okay there's no one else in this entire building of offices. And we can't come tomorrow because public transport is gonna be shut. So I cannot create content as much as I want to I'm paralyzed. I can probably create story content on my phone or you know do some jugad, I'll have to go back to basics as a YouTuber. Like when I began I used to make my maid record my YouTube videos, I'll have to do that again. I remember the green screen man. I remember the beer biceps posters that you gave out also. Back in the day. Back in the day. But you gotta go back to basics now dude like never saw this coming. This is the closest thing you had to Walking Dead. The Walking Dead. I mean alarmist but yeah so I think there's also going to be a need to balance everyone's safety and schedule versus with like actual productivity. There are some industries where I know for example people who are working at like you know food delivery apps and all. Business is going well they are working from home but there are only so many things you can do remotely. So all these dynamics are going to change. Someone was talking to me about how maybe this will be the reason that you know people start adapting a more work from home or remote working approach in India because it's forcing people to experiment with these kind of working styles. I'm just thinking out loud here but so again like we did this detailed Hindi video on the coronavirus. For it I had to research a lot and my final like piece of research was this podcast that Joe Rogan did with this guy called Michael O'Stone. I saw it. Oh what a beautiful podcast. Great podcast. Big fans of Joe Rogan. Yeah yeah and they spoke about how as long as your immunity is high and you have a really healthy lifestyle you're pretty much safe from the effects of the virus. Of course you might be a carry on you might pass it on so it's still not advisable to go out and risk infection. But in saying that I feel like this also might be one of the switches health switches for a lot of people. You know people might start adopting healthier lifestyles going forward which means that the whole wellness industry also might come up after this. True because anything that is a big fundamental like life shift causes you to like think about where you are. If today someone tells you that you know being not having great cardiovascular health or something for example is going to leave you vulnerable. You want to change that. Yeah. And it's going to be a shift and it's also it comes as a responsibility like we may not be as younger people you know the mortality rates for people. Obviously I'm no expert on this from what I've read is quite low for people under 40. But then again there's a concept called herd immunity right. We are immune to certain things because we all take precautions and it doesn't we make it not easy for it to transmit through communities. Which is what our responsibility would be here. All of us live with like our grandparents our parents are you know heading towards like late 50s early 60s. So the responsibility for us is to make sure a healthy environment is there for all of us.","The content industry is experiencing a boom due to the increased amount of time people are spending on the internet as a result of COVID-19. Content creators are having to adapt to working from home and may need to find alternative ways to create content. Some industries, such as food delivery apps, are able to continue operating remotely, but others are facing challenges. This may lead to an increase in remote working and a shift towards healthier lifestyles, which could result in growth in the wellness industry. Individuals have a responsibility to take precautions to prevent the virus from spreading and protect vulnerable members of their community."

So, okay, but coming back to the whole financial side of things, what's the situation with the stock market? Should you be investing in it? What's happening there? There's definitely a case to be made for saying that, you know, you invest when markets are down. Warren Buffett has said that, you know, you buy low, sell high is like the way to do things. And, yeah, definitely the stock market has fallen, but today judging from the way the world is still reacting and still coming to grips with things, you can't say for sure that today, like, I believe the Sensex made a recovery today for quite a while, but then we don't know how markets are going to open tomorrow. There are so many factors at play. There's not just you and I buying stocks in a market, you know. There are international investors buying in Indian markets. There are mutual funds buying for people. So, these big changes, we don't know the way the market could go. Hopefully, it will stabilize, which means it would be a good time if it's stabilizing now you buy and then you wait. See, now if someone is looking to invest, it should be very long term. That, you know, don't think for 2-3 years. Like in which industry? Again, the things we mentioned. Anything you can, like if you want to buy a Sensex ETF, which is the Exchange Traded Fund. What does that mean? So, it means that when you Sensex is an index of all the stocks in the BSE. It represents how the country is doing. Yeah, it represents multiple stocks in the market. So, what people can do is in an ETF, you buy a stock that's representative of a group of shares. Okay, of a group of different companies. Group of different companies. Like you have Nifty 50. Nifty 50 is a group of different companies listed on an index. So, you can buy one stock of Sensex or one stock. So, what the difference is diversified. Like today I buy a stock of, I buy a more motor company. Okay, and now mobility is going to reduce, suppose, like for some reason whatever. People will use lesser cars. Lesser cars and the stock price will go down. But if I buy a Sensex ETF, for example, it's like I'm hedging, I'm diversifying, you know. So, it will include a motor company as well as a gaming company. Exactly. And a gaming company might benefit because of the role of it. Exactly, that will like, so it hedges it, it counteracts what a certain single stock may be doing. So, can you break it down for the viewers, someone who's just looking to get into the stock market. So, if you are, obviously now is a volatile time in the stock market. It's not predictable. It's not predictable, like right now the whole world is waiting and watching. Right, but generally speaking, yeah, buy low, sell high is a thing. You should wait for, when markets are low, it's a great time to buy. It's a great time to buy long term. And it's also better to diversify. Like we're saying, if you hold stocks only extensively in the streaming industry, you're doing really well or content industry, you're doing really well. So, you have to diversify your portfolio, keep things from different sectors. So, you know that there's a balance. Because at certain times, there's no... Some certain sector will be doing better or worse than...","The discussion revolves around the current situation in the stock market and whether it is a good time to invest in it. The speakers mention that Warren Buffett's advice of buying low and selling high applies in this situation, but caution that the market is unpredictable and there are many factors at play. They recommend a long-term investment approach and diversifying one's portfolio to include stocks from different sectors. They explain the concept of Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) as a way to invest in a group of stocks that are representative of an index, such as the Sensex or Nifty 50, to hedge and counteract the volatility of individual stocks. Overall, the speakers suggest that while the current market is volatile, it may be a good time to invest for the long term if done wisely."

You don't know how long we're locked down for. It's been two, three days since the lockdown right now. Yeah, and it's still in progress, right? Like for example, we don't know whether the clampdown is getting more serious in Bombay to what we just heard about government offices that also we just heard about it. We're waiting on things, official communication to come in, which is what we should trust. Because panic at a time like this is the worst thing that we could do. But either way, it's always better to be prepared for the worst case scenario. It is, no doubt. So have a lot of liquid funds. I'd also suggest something on a human level. This is one of my great learnings of life in the last year, which is that everyone perceives money differently. What 500 rupees may mean to you may mean a lot more to your Uber driver or to your watchman or something. This is that moment in human history where you kind of let go of selfishness as well. And you know, put money out there in Indian society. If you feel someone is running short money, go help a friend. Go help someone who really needs money. If you're going out on a cab, don't ask for that 10 bucks change, 20 rupees change. Exactly. Let people, let money spread out. See, it's like we were talking, you know, it's the right time for us. It's our responsibility to help the vulnerable in a time like this. And I don't mean vulnerable just from a health perspective. I mean, from a financial perspective also, like you said, that money means so much more to people. If public transport and all is affected, taxi drivers and all, you know, it matters a lot more to them. So in places where you, suppose as a business owner, I have pending payments to make out and I have small vendors, like I would pay them because you know, who wants to keep anyone hanging in this time where you don't know when his next check is coming, when he doesn't know where his next check is coming from. 100%","During a pandemic outbreak, it is important to take financial precautions such as having a lot of money in liquid form, like in your bank account, as you don't know what's going to happen. It is always better to be prepared for the worst-case scenario. It is suggested to help the vulnerable financially by spreading money out, such as not asking for change when using public transport and paying small vendors promptly. Money means different things to different people, and it is the right time to help those who are financially vulnerable."

Like how should they plan their personal finances? Like how would you do it if you were 24 in 2020? Yeah, so like if I had no background in finance, right? And I'm just trying to do this to optimize my earnings from my savings. I would just do, you know, I would pick up three mutual funds and do a SIP on it, right? Which is, you know, if say I'm saving 10,000 rupees a month, I take 3,000 rupees each and put in three different mutual funds. That's what I would do if I had no financial background. Now, if I'm one of those who has a little bit of financial background or enjoy finance or enjoy tracking companies and businesses and what they do, you know, like you need to have that liking. I mean, I'm the one who picks up in economic times or I'm the one who look at say a Mumbai or a Bangalore mirror, right? I mean, the sense, you know, if I'm the guy who's going to pick up economic times, I think the best way to learn finance is by investing in the stock markets, right? Because, you know, when you invest in a stock, you're tracking everything that can potentially make a difference to it, right? And you learn so much about not just about business, about, you know, finance, about life and, you know, business, you know, what promoters are doing to grow their business, you know, it's, I mean, you can learn 10 times more than what you learn from, say, doing an MBA or whatever, just by putting your money into some stocks and tracking what they're doing as a business. So, but then it makes sense to do it only if you really like all of that. I mean, if you don't like it, I think mutual fund SIP is good. Yeah, if you like finance, as I said, you know, take the money, invest into 510 stocks and start tracking them, you know, closely and then see how it goes, you know, but the basic rule in all of this is that, you know, never put yourself in a situation where you can blow out a lot of money. Like, you know, so risk, you know, being conservative on risk is the only real way to make money in life. Now, this whole, I will hit out of the park, you know, it works for one out of a million person, but then, you know, it's very tough to be that one out of million, you know, it's, it's, it's, I mean, you know, not everyone can, you know, you can't really, you know, as I said, there's, there's stupid amounts of luck required to be that one in a million. You said something interesting, and this forces me to digress away a little bit from the world of finance. What is your opinion on MBAs in 2020? Because you're an engineering student, basically, in your cohort, and I still see the engineer alive in you in like the way you think and all that, dude, for like, again, a 24 year old, who's figuring, okay, dude, should I do an MBA? Should I stay active in the world and just learn in by working in a startup by working the stock market? What's your opinion on MBAs in the modern day? So the thing is, I never really, you know, did my engineering properly. So no, I mean, I, so yeah, so I don't think I qualify really to be called an engineer. So MBA, I personally, I don't think there is really any use case of, of an MBA degree today. I mean, I think, you know, MBA makes sense to go build a network. I mean, I look at it more like that. I don't know if really, you're going to learn, I think you're going to learn a lot more working in a startup or investing in stocks than you learn in an MBA. Right. But what an MBA does though, is, you know, if you go and do it in a really good school, you know, I have friends who have done from great schools and they just build this stupid network of people, right? As in you, you know, I mean, you know, you're an IM Bangalore student, you know, you can just go after this, you know, entire IMB, like a 20 year old guy, right? And then, and he will have some feeling for you and he will, you know, it's a good way to network. And I think MBA is more that, you know, I mean, even, even if you look at all the, you know, folks of rich kids, of rich folks, you know, who send their kids to Stanford and Harvard, I think it's more to build those networks than to, you know, than to really, for the education, than really the education, because education today is free. I mean, you know, like, you know, you can learn anything and everything for free today. I don't think there is, I mean, if you've seen what's happening in the U S with this COVID thing, right? They've gone online, they're teaching, you know, like whatever is available on YouTube, they're probably teaching, charging you $50,000 a year. Right. So, I mean, so yes, I think, I think MBA is good for building network, you know, improving your soft skills. It's, you know, how to present, how to sell, you know, stuff like that. You know, otherwise, I don't, otherwise, I don't, otherwise, I don't,","The discussion covers personal finance, investment options, and the usefulness of an MBA degree. The speaker recommends a mutual fund SIP for those with no financial background and an interest in low-risk investment. For those with a financial background and interest in finance, investing in stocks can be a great way to learn about business and finance. However, the speaker emphasizes the need for being conservative with risk. The usefulness of an MBA degree is also discussed, with the speaker suggesting that it is more useful for networking than education, as education can be obtained for free."

In the year 2100, what do you think the world of finance will look like? Will it be similar to what we're doing right now, but just more advanced? What do you think the future simulation of the world of finance is? Well, I mean, I've just now finished Sapiens, the book, and so I'm kind of, I have this, I think I might have a bias because I've just read that book and how world's been so drastically changing from 40 years back to today. It's a brilliant book, someone wants to read it. I think the way the world's changing, I don't know if anyone can really predict. This whole thing around artificial intelligence and I don't know what 2050 will be, because I think this whole humankind of whatever tens of thousands of years, right, where nothing happened really, right? And then you had this capitalism which took over the world in the 19th, 20th century, whatever 19th, 20th century, which is just, the world is evolving so fast in the last 1500 years and what was working for you five years back is redundant today. So I don't even know, I mean, I have no clue, I have no clue, a lot of people ask me, Nitin, what is your five year plan for Zarotha? I say, I don't know what's gonna happen tomorrow morning. Because it's evolving so fast, it's just changing and I think what this world needs is people who can adapt quickly, right? And I think the way to adapt quickly is to remain lean if you're a business, because you have high amounts of debt, high amounts of all these technical debts of sorts what happens is it becomes tough to maneuver as a business. And even as an individual, I think the constant effort for everyone has to be just keep learning about whatever new is happening, because that what is, whatever new is happening can suddenly take over your world without even realizing about it, right? And so, yeah, so it's tough to say, I don't know how 2100 will look like. I don't even know if humans will find out how to keep the planet alive. The planet alive, the planet alive, the planet alive.","The speaker is asked to speculate about what the world of finance will look like in the year 2100. However, they acknowledge that predicting the future is difficult, given the rapid pace of change and the unpredictability of technological advancements such as artificial intelligence. The speaker emphasizes the importance of adaptability in this rapidly changing world, both for businesses and individuals. They suggest that remaining lean and constantly learning about new developments can help people to navigate the changing landscape of finance and other fields. The speaker also notes that the survival of the planet itself is uncertain, which further complicates any predictions about the future of finance or other aspects of human society."

And for someone, you know, say who is working in a startup, who's so busy thinking about the startup, that they can't really think of, okay, I want to step into the world of stock markets. Would you suggest a portfolio management service firm as a good option? And what's your general opinion on PMS firms? Because I've seen that generally online, whenever influencers speak about portfolio management services, the stock market nerds will come on and say, hey, don't do this, this is wrong, you're making a mistake. So what's your opinion on it? Well, I think people who don't have the bandwidth should go seek help. Either, I don't think, it's a dangerous game, because if it's your savings and earnings, which is at stake, I don't think it makes sense to be penny wise, pound foolish types. Find an advisor who can help you, find a mutual fund manager, or find a portfolio manager. I mean, if there's no time, I don't think you should just take, that's a weird thing that I've seen, when it comes to money. I know folks will go bargain, they want to buy tomatoes, for example. I'll say they want to buy a refrigerator. They'll go research, they will find, they'll spend hours and hours. And then suddenly they want to buy a stock. Some friend said somewhere, you know what, the stock will go up, buy it, you bought it in two seconds. And I'm like, dude, why is that behavior so different? Which is, you buy a refrigerator, you're putting so much research and effort, why not for a, when you're putting your life savings at stake. It's very weird, I don't know what is the reason behind it, but most people behave like that. If I right now tell you to buy a stock, you might actually buy it. The odds of that happening is quite high, without really doing any kind of research. But if I tell you, you know what, you should buy this refrigerator, you'll probably go do research before buying it. So it's, so yeah, I think I'm from that, I think what India needs right now, which is missing, and one of the reasons for US markets to be so successful is because of, you know, the US enabled this whole advisory ecosystem, right? Over the last 30, 40 years in the US, what has happened is the businesses have grown because of professional advisors. Like in India, it has grown because of distributors. Okay, the difference here is this, right? An advisor doesn't make any money from the manufacturer. For example, if I sell you a mutual fund, if I'm an advisor, I don't make any money from the, you know, the guy who was making my mutual funds, I can charge you an advisory fees. A distributor earns from the manufacturer, but he doesn't earn anything from you. Now, you know, right, there's a conflict of interest, right? Because if I'm distributing to you, I'll distribute what is gonna make me more money than what is better for you, right? Now, if I'm an advisor, I will, I know that you will pay me a fees only if I make you some money, right? So the US, the way it's worked over the last 30, 40 years is it's all grown out of professional advisory ecosystem. In India, it's always through distributors. You know, your bank manager is selling you insurance, mutual funds, you know, some other guy is distributing and all of these guys are doing it because they have revenue targets, right? And to me, the revenue targets are just selling you something, you know? I don't know if it's in your best interest or not. The reason that is like that in India is that Indians don't like to pay an advisory fees, right? Because, you know, you're like, you know, if I ask you for 100 rupees for giving this advice, like, why dude? You know, why are you asking? But if I make 1000 rupees from, you know, the manufacturer, you have no problem because you don't see it going from you, right? So, you know, so yeah, so the US, what has happened is these professional advisors, they have almost created professional investors over the last 30, 40 years, right? Because, you know, if I'm your advisor, say we keep talking to each other, say every once in a month, once in a quarter, I keep telling you what is the right strategy, et cetera. So they, you know, you will automatically become better as a person, right? You know, you will understand more about the markets, et cetera. And that's what has happened in the US, you know, you suddenly have people are so much more professional, so much more professional, so much more professional, so much more professional, so much more professional,","The discussion is about whether portfolio management service (PMS) firms are a good option for someone who is busy with work and doesn't have time to research the stock market. The speaker believes that if it's your savings and earnings at stake, it's not wise to be penny-wise and pound foolish. Instead, they suggest finding an advisor, mutual fund manager, or portfolio manager to help. The speaker also notes that India's advisory ecosystem is different from that of the US, where professional advisors have created professional investors over the last few decades. In India, the revenue targets are based on selling products, which creates a conflict of interest. The speaker suggests that India needs a professional advisory ecosystem to create more professional investors."

So that makes us a country of terrible salesmen because 98% of the countries doing arranged marriages, which makes us terrible at sales. And I think I learned that doing that extra matters so much in a country where people are just not trying to push for it. Like I appreciated the effort that you took to get the perfect setting for this podcast. And I like people who do that because it's the extra 5% that makes all the difference and not just like, okay, you set up the mic, you sent me a microphone, you get all the settings done. To me, all the value that I have seen people create is by the spirit that they have in their work. And I think that's been my thing that I do not like to work with people who do not do this to the last level. I like to hang around with people. I think businesses just happen to be happening around same time. But if I have to look at my journey, I have done all sorts of things. I have probably done, I don't know, 15, 20 different types of businesses. I'm known for one or two. But the thing is, it's been a constant journey of iteration. And if I have to point out to one thing that has helped me kind of create some successful businesses is to understand the core concept of human motivation. What do people want? And will they pay money for it? Right. And I think most of businesses miss exactly these two points. And they imagine problems and therefore start solving it. And they imagine the severity of problem that people will pay for money for that problem. Right. And I think that is the core two insights through which I have kind of been very fortunate to constantly build businesses. And I don't know anything else to do in life. So I keep building businesses.","The discussion covers various topics, but for someone interested in finance, the main takeaway is the importance of understanding human motivation and identifying problems that people are willing to pay for.

The speaker also mentions their experience in starting and iterating on multiple businesses, emphasizing the importance of constant improvement."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH6WUTFmgg8_sep_292_548,nH6WUTFmgg8_sep_292_548,"But is it, would you reframe that sentence as you get your biggest kick out of business? Like you get your biggest life's high out of business? I think that's a fair point. I think my core need is to be curious and to know things. But do I really know it? Can you only be tested by if I made a business out of it? Right. So let's say business is the application of knowledge because knowledge for the sake of knowledge is not as valuable because you have not tested it. Right. And I think India has too many Gyan. Otherwise, right. So the application of Gyan is everything. I believe that otherwise knowledge is freely available on YouTube as much as we want. But most people are so addicted to just listening to Gyan and motivational stuff and doing zero things in life. And I think that to me is the biggest problem of India. I would say summarizing it that way too much knowledge, way too much Gyan, very few people trying to apply and improve that. Completely agree. While I do feel that's changing because right before this podcast started, I gave you the Gyan that I give most entrepreneurs in their thirties, which is that a 27 year old and a guy even in his late thirties are way more similar in India compared to that 27 year old and the 22 year olds of this country. That's because of the impact of the internet. And I mean, I want to, I want to ask you a very broad question. Feel free to answer it in whatever way you wish to answer it. What is India in 2016 going to look like? Oh, that's a hard one. Either we have an extraordinarily bright future or a very dark one. The reason it could be dark is that what capitalism has done, the world has become like a one big superconductor, right? All of us are connected to each other. And the way to understand this is very simple. A joke becomes popular instantly, right? Everybody knows about the joke. Saying the joke next day also is not cool because everybody's heard it already. Right? So the world is super hyper connected and everything is just spreading very, very fast. And because of that, when innovations come, they spread very, very fast as well. Right. And sometimes they take away jobs. Right. And when we are not prepared for that change quickly, the skills that we have will be irrelevant very quickly. India has this unique curse of terrible education system, not having the curiosity mindset to learn more things. Right. And fundamentally the world will therefore take away the jobs and automate them. But the job losses will happen in India because the world is connected. Right. So an American becoming more efficient is taking away a job in India. And we don't even understand this connection right now. For example, let's say because of COVID, all centers in the US are not working and they somehow all figured out to outsource two homes. But now they realize that all the homes are outsourceable. So they gave it to India. But now they figured out we can automate this stuff because people are doing IVR on their own and app pay or airline booking, all that stuff. Everybody has learned how to become tech savvy. Boom, millions of jobs are gone, but they're not gone in the US. They're gone in India. Right. So I think the world's useless jobs are getting accumulated in poor countries. And in 2016, unless we shut our borders and make like, kind of think of a North Korea kind of an imagination where we are only creating and we are only using kind of a thing, it's going to be very, very hard. Now, the positive side of this is that we have a very, very young nation, probably the youngest in all the nations. And if people figure out that they don't need to depend on education system to become smart and learn skills, and just that basic skill is taught and happened in people's mind. I think we will learn how to crack things. I think, I think, I think.","The discussion revolves around the value of knowledge and its application in business, specifically in India. The speakers agree that there is too much focus on theoretical knowledge, or ""gyan,"" and not enough emphasis on practical application. They also discuss the potential impact of automation and innovation on job loss in India due to the country's education system and lack of a curiosity mindset. However, the speakers also acknowledge the potential for India's young population to learn practical skills and thrive if they focus on application rather than just theoretical knowledge. In general, the discussion highlights the importance of balancing theoretical knowledge with practical application in business and society."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH6WUTFmgg8_sep_549_842,nH6WUTFmgg8_sep_549_842,"The country's biggest curse is that we are all job seekers. If you look at Google Trends and look at the top 10 keyword searches every day, out of that top 10, two are for government exams. And that is the level that I am worried about that if everybody is just hoping for that one government job, the problem is the government does not need so many people. Please understand the largest employer of the world is inefficiency. And when you remove inefficiency, those jobs are gone. And the problem is the skill sets that we have had, there are so many jobs in India which are not required like lift man or ATM watchman. There are probably millions of people guarding ATMs. But what if people stop using cash? What happens then? So I think we are just not ready. Our education systems are not just there. Our dependency on agriculture is way too high. And one more scary factor which nobody pays attention to, the number of women working in labor force is dropping every year. Less than 10% of urban Indian women work and have financial independence. This is lower than Pakistan. This is lower than Bangladesh. Bangladesh has 68%. We are at 8%. China is at 90%. And we just don't notice it because we don't pay attention to it. But look at the airport, how many queues for women and how many for men? How many compartments in metro for women versus men? When you stand in rush hour, how many women do you see and how many men do you see? 94% to 92% of all credit cards are owned by men. 95% of all personal loans are taken by men. We have not fundamentally understood that we are a fairly patriarchal and regressive nation because we don't look at data. And the scary part is every year the female participation of labor is dropping, not increasing. What do you think will be the catalyst to change all this? There has to be a solution. And this is where, you know, maybe the entrepreneurial side of people like yourself has to kick in. It's a scary thing because India is trying to play the game of capitalism, but the blood is of socialism. Oh shit. Okay, hold up. Could you explain capitalism and socialism really easily for the listener? Like in very basic terms. Capitalism is very simple. You use capital to produce more kids, employ more people. The whole society focuses on wealth. Innovation is rewarded disproportionately to one inventor and one manufacturer, one businessman, one industrialist if they do good stuff. And therefore the overall wealth of society increases. But socialism unfortunately, which has failed everywhere in the world and India has still not adopted to this, is that where you say that everything is governed by the state, it's shared equally. So if a patent is made in India, you don't get the benefit of it. It is assumed to be a public good. And it's a complex topic. But the thing is 99% of Indians have no clue what is capitalism or socialism. For example, a lot of people think MRP is a good idea. Every product has MRP. And fundamentally that is against capitalism because why somebody like you and me who are staying in affluent neighborhoods paying 30 rupees for diet coke and somebody who is not staying in affluent neighborhoods are paying 30 rupees. We should be paying 100 rupees for that. Because our real estate is expensive in our area, storage is more expensive, delivery cost is more expensive. But MRP removes this and it's a very socialistic approach saying that sabko ek hi price. And this fundamental concept is not understood by Indians. If you tell people is MRP good for you, everybody will say, yeah, it's great. But and this is why we have no clue about capitalism. And it is going to take a complete overhaul of our education system or our government's thinking to really improve that because the government somehow operates also with a socialist mindset because the country has been this and therefore like there are lots of subsidies and all of that stuff which does not create wealth. And the problem is most of our taxes are coming from capitalism. Right. So 30-40 million people who are doing their jobs are paying taxes, a lot of businesses who are in capital, who are in capital, who are in capital, who are in capital, who are in capital, who are in capital.","The speaker points out that India's reliance on government jobs and inefficiency is a major issue, with the education system and gender inequality exacerbating the problem. He highlights the need for a shift towards entrepreneurship and a better understanding of capitalism, which rewards innovation and creates wealth, as opposed to socialism, which hinders it. The speaker argues that India's taxes largely come from capitalism, and a change in mindset and education is necessary to address these issues."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH6WUTFmgg8_sep_843_1040,nH6WUTFmgg8_sep_843_1040,"taxes. But the thing is that we have still the mindset that we are working in PSG, in government, in work. That's the mindset we are operating at. You've heard about stories about how 100 jobs created like one crore applications, that kind of mindset that we are operating with. And the country is fundamentally status seeking more than wealth seeking. And therefore the Indian crab story is a very popular story. I don't know if you've heard about this story where there is a story that says one guy goes to a crab store and there are lots of these containers where crabs are stored. And one container is kept open. And the guy is like, why is this container open? He's like, what is that Indian crabs? He's like, what do you mean by that? I'm like, don't worry. As soon as one guy starts to climb up, three guys will pull him down. Right. And this is the fundamental problem of difference between wealth driven society and status driven societies. Right. A status driven society fundamentally dislikes anybody going up in life. A wealth driven society is like, right. And they are way more collaborative. And I think we don't understand this because we've never seen a collaborative society. I'll tell you another factor that India, that we don't understand. India is not one country. India is 25 countries merged to become one country. And therefore we have need for neutral platforms. Let's take example of neutral platforms. Our neutral sport is cricket, not from India. The way Kunal and Ranveer can speak to each other is through a neutral language, which is English. Our neutral beverage is tea and coffee, not from India. When we have a party at office, the neutral food that is ordered is pizza, not from India. Samosa is not from India. Biryani is not from India. In fact, I recently discovered that even khichdi is not from India. Oh really? Is it from Nepal? It's from the East. So China, Nepal, somewhere around. The point is we do not realize that the need for this country to come through neutral platforms. For example, let's say, magically we ban arranged marriages, and we also ban same language relationships. Let's say a Gujarati cannot marry a Gujarati, Punjabi cannot marry a Punjabi. Fundamentally all the kids that are born after that will be English. Naturally, because the neutral platform that connects a Gujarati to somebody Bengali is English. Right? And I think we don't realize and accept these things. And we are confused between still fighting elections on the old topics, are stuck on some old principles. And the reason we are like that is that nobody's interested in future. Everybody's happily celebrating past. Right? The fact that we are still thinking about, let's say building statues of some old people or creating some things which take a lot of money to build some of the stuff about past glory. I think every time I've seen nations super obsessed about their past, I'm usually delusioned about their future.","The discussion touches on the mindset of Indians towards finance and the country's need for neutral platforms. India is more status-seeking than wealth-seeking, and the country's collaborative spirit is hindered by a crab mentality that dislikes people's success. India is not one country but 25 countries merged into one, so there is a need for neutral platforms to connect people. Examples of neutral platforms include cricket, English language, tea and coffee, and pizza. The discussion suggests that Indians are too focused on the past, which hinders the country's progress towards the future."

Is that the next Facebook of the world and the next Amazon of the world might come out of this country? And that's also a flaw of India where, you know, we always aim to create national businesses and not international businesses. But do you agree with me when I say something like that, that possibly the next AI startup, which will revolutionize everything in the world can come out of here. The next virtual reality startup can come out of here. I have very little hope on that. The reason I have little hope on that is naturally the country has always lost its best talent to the global audience. Right. I'll give you a story. I was once in Stanford and I met a bunch of Indian and Chinese students over there. And I asked every Indian student, so are you coming back? And not a single person was coming back. And I asked all the Chinese that, Hey, what's your plan after Stanford? And all of them are going back to China. So if our smartest brains are going to be leaving the country, and I think that's where the tricky part of socialism comes in. Right. If you feel that as a taxpayer, the country is not rewarding you back. Let's say Bombay, Bangalore contribute to a large chunk of taxes. But what if the taxes contribution back to the city is very, very low because we have a lot of people to take care of this country. Then you're like, yeah, let me just go. And now with technology, you can actually be anywhere. Right. For example, Facebook can employ somebody in Columbia with an Indian sitting over there. So world is going to be getting all mismatched and the whole different kind of matchmaking is going to start happening where everybody's okay with anybody being anywhere. And that is a scary possibility. Now coming to, can you build these companies? The thing is talent and audacity and money and product mindset is something that is extremely hard. Right. Like I said, we had like a lot of global companies, CEOs are Indians. So it's not that there is no brain, but the exposure. We forget that all the Indians that we are proud of have changed their citizenship long ago, have lived abroad. They are way more Americans than Indians. But there is in psychology, there is something called as basking in reflected glory. Right. So it's called, we were happy that the CEO of Google is Indian. But boss, you have no benefit. Right. So the point is we've had the opportunity for the years and years, but we are constantly losing talent. And as a country, it's extremely hard to take care of the smartest people over here, where we have millions and billions of people to invest behind. Right. Or their education or their food, like the amount of subsidies that we have to take care of or among the loans that we have to wave off. So my worry is that the brain drain that is happening constantly is scary because it is happening in my circles. Like some of the people that smart people that I have hired have now moved abroad and working in big companies like Uber and Spotify and all these places. And I'm like, I'm just going to keep losing people who are really, really good. Then who's building the product for India. Right. And I think that is a scary possibility. And while it is cool and nationalistic, say, no, it will come, it will come. But how will it come? Tell me some plan, tell me some idea, how can it come? Show me some early signs. I think that is the scary part. And you notice one interesting pattern is that many times we had Indian startups doing something, global companies came and they became bigger in the same space, right. And almost competing neck to neck in many cases, right. Like you look at cab companies or e-commerce companies or payment companies. Right. Fundamentally, we are not able to keep up and competing with them. So the thing is that how do we become global companies? Right. The sheer ruthlessness or the sheer relentlessness that we need to make it big and the amount of capital and talent required is probably likely to not be there because great talent can work anywhere. Are we creating a country where people would love to stay, be enjoying their time, would love to have their kids raised? I think these questions are hard. And as a nation, we are conflicted between there's a small group that feels like they're in Singapore and there is this rest of the nation that feels like Africa and we've joined them together in average India. Right. And therefore there's an interesting thing when you fly over Bombay or Bangalore, you'll see suddenly the sky rises and then Juggias and then like kuch bhi chal raha hai. Right. And that is the state of India, right. That if now, let's say medical care is not there, like where would you want to be locked down during COVID? India or abroad? If flights really opened up, you think many Indians would just probably go in countries that are likely to have more better healthcare? So I think those are the questions which are harder to answer. And it's not in government's hands. So a lot of times we just start coming and blaming the government. The problem is country is built by its people. All the knowledge is available on YouTube. How much are people reading? Right. We are having to constantly dumb down content so that it makes sense to people. But the point is that you are competing in a global world. We are making text books easier to understand. We're making videos easier to understand. We are summarizing, we are summarizing, we are summarizing, we are, summarizing, we are summarizing, summarizing","The speaker expresses concern over India's ability to produce the next Facebook or Amazon, as the country has a history of losing its best talent to global companies. He cites the difficulty of retaining talented individuals due to a lack of incentives and the country's struggle to create international businesses. Additionally, he highlights the mismatched nature of the world with the ability for anyone to work from anywhere, and the difficulty of creating a company with the necessary talent, audacity, money, and product mindset. The speaker calls for the country to create an environment that retains talent and fosters innovation."

Today I think Jeff Bezos' net worth crossed 200 billion dollars. What can a kid sitting in a village in India that you've never heard of, what can that kid learn from Jeff Bezos in terms of a mindset? And that which he can adopt if he has to become the Bezos of India? That's a very good question. I think all the billionaires who have become billionaires have become big through very basic principles of life, right? And understanding how things work, right? And understanding is not the responsibility of your teacher. Understanding the world and how it operates is your responsibility. And if you are waiting that, arey yaar, parents bolenge to padhai karenge, yaar phir koi teacher bolega to padhai karenge, yaar coaching classes. Like our biggest curse of this country, we're all getting coaching classes to solve a super dumb exam, super dumb hacks and then we think we are smart when we have understood nothing. And I would say that very simple thing is you are not going to make it big if you do not understand, not when you score marks, when you do not understand what is the business, what is the principles of the business. How many people are curious about understanding like jio kaise chaltaar, right? What is the revenue model? What is the average ARPU? We don't know these words also. And are we waiting for education system to teach us this stuff? Because by the time you get bigger and go to college, all these words are irrelevant anyways. And you'll feel like a 20 years old old syllabus is being taught. Right? Because is our entrepreneurs building educational institutes? No. So they are already way ahead on some of these things. So many Stanford courses are available free on YouTube. I sometimes see 5000 videos of you. I was like, ye gold ye gold ye gold ye gold ye gold ye gold.","The discussion centers around what a kid sitting in a village in India can learn from Jeff Bezos' success and how he can adopt a similar mindset to become successful. The speakers believe that billionaires become successful by understanding the basic principles of life and the world, which is the individual's responsibility and not the education system's. They argue that it is essential to understand the business and its principles, and one can learn from free courses available on YouTube. The speakers also criticize the reliance on coaching classes and the education system, which they believe hinder true understanding and curiosity."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH6WUTFmgg8_sep_3413_3730,nH6WUTFmgg8_sep_3413_3730,"Even if you grow a gaming skill set, just having that second, third, fourth, fifth skill set can add so much to even your gaming career. So I'd probably look at it like that. Now one of the final few questions I have for you in the podcast, again we spoke a lot about wealth driven societies in this. And that seems to be a concept that you think about a lot. Therefore I feel like you think about wealth a lot in general. I'm not talking about money, I'm just talking about wealth even means knowledge, wealth means just the ability to invest in different places, the ability to affect other people's lives, ability to elevate your team, all that is wealth. Keeping that in mind, what other next industries you as an entrepreneur would invest in, would keep an eye out for, for this country, slash for the world? What are you looking at specifically? And I obviously have to ask you that do you have an eye on social media? Like again, that's a selfish question, but really want to know. All wealth is created when you help people achieve what they want in life. So the moment you make it easy for them to achieve what they want, they give you money for it. So money is what we pay to somebody or a product to make it easy for us to achieve what we want. That's a summary of a business. Now people want different things. For example, if you ask a lot of Indian parents, they would disproportionately spend on let's say educating their kids, but would they pay five rupees extra delivery charge to get Swiggy one minute faster? No. Because as a country, we never had industrial revolution. A country that does not have industrial revolution does not understand the value of time. So for example, if you go to any Western country, you ask them what is your salary per hour? Everybody knows. Because their first job was an hourly salary job. And even if their income grew, their math in their head is one hour ka mera salary kitna hai. In India, if you ask anybody what's your income per hour, they have no clue. Because our first job was a monthly job and continues to be a monthly income. And therefore we do not take good decisions about time on an hourly basis. For example, if you find out that your salary per hour is 5000 rupees, does it make sense to spend 30 minutes to look for a 200 rupees discount for a flight ticket? And these questions are not asked because we don't understand these concepts. And therefore in this country, making money on products that save time sometimes is harder versus products that increase status because we are a status-driven society. And fundamentally all the profits are in status-driven society. I'll tell you one fun example. I have a friend who used to be a buyer at a very large retail company in India. I asked him to just check one thing that here, can you please check the margins of product in products that are sold for living room and products that are sold for bedroom. And she's like, I said categorization we have dining, we have kitchen, I said no, no, please check for living room versus bedroom. And the profit margins of products for living room had 3x more margins in bedroom in a large retail company. Why? Because living room products are made for status. Bedroom is not. And fundamentally therefore margins in India are more in living room products than bedroom products. But if you switch this context and go to Western countries where it's individualistic, they'll be spending a lot more money in their bed sheets and lot more in their mattresses and beautiful pillows and their bathrooms will have expensive products because they're taking care of themselves. But we are thinking about, what will people say? And therefore the motivation and margins exist in about status. Like think about all your relatives. Am I likely to make money from them if I offer them status or convenience? Think about it. The answer is almost instant. What would be examples of status driven businesses that have this status game at their core? Like think about Mania Var, Shadi Ke Kapda Hai, iPhone, Audi, Chashma. You'll be surprised these have 70-80% gross margin because it makes you look cool. The material cost is nothing. It'll probably be 30 rupees, 40 rupees. But it's sold for, if you put a Gucci next to it, it'll probably sell for 5000, 25,000, 60,000. Any product that we signal like this thing, I'm wearing, what is this? Just because there's an Adidas logo, it'll be so much more expensive because you can recognize, oh, this is Adidas. I know what this is. And status products are designed naturally that way. I'll tell you what, remember when you were in school and anybody who got the magnetic compass box was cool? All kids are status driven. They're not well driven by design.","The discussion revolves around the concept of wealth and how it is created. The speaker suggests that all wealth is created when people are helped to achieve what they want in life. This could mean making it easy for them to achieve their goals or saving them time. However, in a country like India, people are more driven by status than convenience or time. This means that businesses that offer status-driven products or services are likely to be more profitable than those that offer convenience. Examples of status-driven businesses include luxury brands like Gucci, iPhone, Audi, and designer clothing. The discussion also touches upon the concept of time and how it is valued differently in different societies, with Western countries placing a higher value on time than countries like India."

It's in many ways an amplifier. I think it's an amplifier, I think so. I think there's this phrase, there's so many phrases in our culture that reveal ourselves. And one of them is, money changes people. And listen to how people say that, money changes people. Such a disparaging tone. You know what? Of course money changes people. It should change people. It should make you be able to dream bigger than you ever thought. It should make you be able to take something that you didn't enjoy doing or doesn't add value and remove it from your life or delegate it from your life or simply make it go away. Money should change your life. But the common perception is that, if I made a million dollars, I'm gonna start blowing it on this and that and that doesn't have to happen. That reveals a profound lack of trust in yourself. I know, I always knew and I know it now. If I made 10 times more than what I make today, it's not like I'm gonna go blow it on a bunch of Ferraris that I don't care about. I bought a four door Honda Accord when I graduated from college. I'm a sensible Indian dude. But I know that, I knew that if I made more money, I would be able to dial into the things that I value. Things like relationships, for example, my wife and I brought our parents along with us on our six week honeymoon. We could talk about that. Really? Yeah, for part of it, not for all of it. For the first week and then we're like, have a nice time. And also you've updated the book to talk about relationship advice with respect to money. Totally, and that is another area where, as you accumulate money, which again is just a small but important part of a rich life, you can use it to craft your rich life with your partner or with your parents or with your friends. My dream when I started off was just to be able to order rounded drinks for my friends and not have to worry, do I have enough money in the bank? That's a rich life. And then as you make more money, your dreams can get bigger. So yes, money does change people, but it should. And you choose where and how it changes you. It is an amplifier. When I say amplifier, I mean, it can amplify your bad behaviors. True. Or it can amplify your good behaviors, right? We often talk about tools and technology is one of those tools, but a fairly crude analogy is like, if you have a chainsaw, you can use it for all kinds of really good things. Like, oh my God, this tree is about to fall in my neighbor's house. Let me protect them by cutting the limbs off or whatever, or you can use it to chop your neighbor into tiny little pieces. It really depends on how you use that tool and money is a tool. I also think that we unfortunately treat it as if it is the most important thing in our lives. And then of course we wanna swing away from that and then we pretend it's not important at all. 100%, we have a very paradoxical culture, which is extremely unhealthy. On one hand, it's so puritanical. People are using words like money changes people or money's evil, it's the root of all evil. That's not even the real quote, but that's what people repeat. And if they made money, they had to step on people to get there. All these phrases that we grew up with. In last night, you actually had people say, when you think of money, what is the first thing you talk about? I heard words like anxiety or debt. Embarrassed. Embarrassed, struggle. And then a few people were like security or flexibility. Oh yeah. We had a couple yesterday that used my book and my material and they were a couple and they said, we love that we can decide, hey, we wanna go to Paris next week, let's go. That is a rich life to them. And that's flexibility. So it's so interesting that in our culture, we talk about all the negative things about money, but nobody sits down and actually talks about the real positive ones. Notice by the way that the minute you start talking about the positive, people will immediately drift into the negative. They'll go like this. You go, what could money do for you? What's your rich life? And people will say, oh, I could travel. It's not like I need to go first class everywhere. It's not like I need this or that. They start by saying what they don't want. We love to define ourselves by what we don't do. And what I would challenge people with a rich life is to define yourself by what you do, what you want, and then work backwards from there. Isn't it fascinating how one person's rich life is another person's sort of misery, right? I know for me, I really dislike traveling. And so I think about these people who are like, yeah, if I just had a million dollars, I could travel the world. I'm like, if I had a million dollars, the last thing I would wanna do is travel the world with that. And that was what was so fascinating about the event last night is people, it wasn't this, you put specificity behind what a rich life is. Let me ask you this, what is your rich life? My rich life is to be able to never have to make a bad decision because of money, specifically never have to work with someone that I don't like or that I don't respect. If that's the case, goodbye. They don't work with me anymore. And that could be an employee, a vendor, place I get coffee from, that's it. It's to be able to travel for one month per year with my wife, and it's to be able to create a family trip with my whole family at least once every couple of years where we just kind of really enjoy bringing the nephews and nieces with us. So those are the things that are my rich life. But I have to tell you that ebbs and flows over time. Well, like when I started out 22 years old, it was to be able to order appetizers because I never got to do that growing up as a kid. Then it was like, oh, I moved to New York. I wanna take the train, or excuse me, I wanna take a cab during summer because I don't wanna walk into a meeting dripping with sweat. I sweat a lot, look at this body hair. I sweat a lot. And then your dreams get bigger, right? So then it was, for example, with our honeymoon, this was an interesting example that I didn't even realize how small I was thinking. So my plan when we got married was I'd been saving for a honeymoon for a long time. One of the things I talk about in the book is the difference between the wealthy and everyone else is the wealthy save before they need to, before they need to, before they need to.","In this discussion, the speaker emphasizes that money is a small but important part of a rich life. Money can amplify both good and bad behaviors, and people should choose how it changes them. The speaker argues that our culture treats money paradoxically - on one hand, people often view money negatively, as something that changes people for the worse, and on the other hand, people also view money as extremely important. The speaker suggests that people should define themselves by what they want and work backwards from there to create their own rich life, rather than defining themselves by what they don't want. The speaker notes that one person's rich life may be another person's misery, and emphasizes the importance of defining one's own rich life."

What do you do with the money? Anyway, yeah. So, the surplus cash, let's talk about that. Once you build that core skill set, once you've raked in some cash, you're in your early 22-23s. How do you start the investment journey? Educate yourself about basic finance. How do you do it, you ask? How do you do it? How do you do it, you ask? We're living in the day and age of the internet. You have the Rachana Rana days of the world. You have the Ankur Varakus of the world. Go check out their basic personal finance videos and educate yourself about what are equities, what are stocks, what is crypto, what's fixed deposits, and why you should not invest in that. Ankur Varaku click-click. Educate yourself about the basics of finance and then move on to the next step of actually practically investing in these markets. We're also now going to cover the basics because we've covered them in other videos and we're pretty sure that if you guys are watching this video, even you all have seen all the videos we've seen on the Indian internet. So, it's not really the time to highlight the basics but what I will also say is, I personally always feared learning the basics of personal finance. I thought it's a very unfriendly domain until I just started asking the stupid questions. So, at this stage, at the point number three stage, ask the stupid questions. The right people will never make fun of you for asking silly questions. Yeah, ask the silly questions. What is Sensex? What is Nifty? What is SIP? It does not matter. It's not stupid. Either Google it if you're feeling shy or just go ask an expert. But if you want the direct call to action, the basic financial advice that I've got from a lot of high-profile finance CEOs is, you go in with the tried and tested methods, which are mutual funds, which are SIPs. That's a great place to begin. But, speak, speak, speak,","The discussion is about what to do with surplus cash once you have a basic skill set and have earned some money in your early 20s. The first step is to educate yourself about basic finance, such as equities, stocks, crypto, and fixed deposits, and why not to invest in them. You can do this by watching videos by experts like Rachana Rana and Ankur Varaku. The next step is to ask the stupid questions and not be afraid to learn. It is recommended to start with tried and tested methods like mutual funds and SIPs. Communication is also important, so speak to experts and ask questions."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZxCIHRIYdo_sep_517_704,FZxCIHRIYdo_sep_517_704,"Speaking about personal finance, we have to highlight point number four. Very, very crucial in the realms of financial knowledge. Knowledge about the stock market. Again, something that scared me a lot initially until I just figured out that... It's just these basic disciplines. Viraj actually has worked a little bit more deeply in the stock market. What do you have to say? I actually burned... I mean... I actually had a terrible experience growing up with the stock market because my dad lost a lot of money in the 2008 crisis. Which actually scared me away from getting into the stock market a lot. But what I did realize is that he was doing something which was not making sense. He was trading on tips. Not on any sort of financial fundamentals, not on any sort of research. He was just getting tips and a lot of our fathers and that generation was purely working on tips. That he heard that his stock will increase, let's take his stock. The Harshad Mehta type. But now in today's times with so many software, with so many advanced apps, with so much research coming through, you know how to study the fundamentals of a stock. So do that, do your research and be a long-term investor to start with. Don't be a trader to start with. And if you have, say, a capital of a lakh, don't spend 90,000 rupees trading on some stock that you got a tip for. Be a long-term investor. Start small but start steady. Also keep in mind, studying the stock market is just like studying a sport. There's a bunch of micro skills you need to learn, micro disciplines that you have to follow throughout your stock market journey. Be it someone like Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, be it someone who's an intermediate level investor, they all follow certain kinds of disciplines. We're not going to talk about those in this particular video. But you need to study the stock market before getting in. When you're getting into the stock market, you need to take a very small amount of money that you can afford to lose and experiment with that money because your little micro experiments in the stock market will actually make you a better trader. What will trading give you? Trading will give you a picture of how finance is in the real world. Trading will give you a picture of what's happening in the world of money in India, all over the world. It'll teach you a lot about yourself as well. You keep increasing your self-awareness the more you trade. Therefore, don't be afraid of the stock market. Just learn the basics, get in, experiment a little bit, get better. And once you're more confident, once you're more comfortable, it's just like learning a sport. Once you're confident dribbling, once you're confident passing, you can actually play in a sort of semi-professional football match, right? And then the more you play, the better you get. That's how the stock market works, but it begins by learning the basics, the ABCs. You have to study stock market theory. It'll be a lifelong skill. And trade only when you've started your basic level of investing. Don't burn your hands by trading on a daily basis in F&Os and all of that. Just focus on investing, on working and investing in long-term quality companies. Also, now we're talking about investing in the stock market, right? So by this point, you've picked up a certain amount of financial skills. Use those financial skills to open up more revenue streams, to earn money from other places. Ideally, according to us, the US stock market. Very crucial and just hear us out. And point number five. And why do we say that? Why?","The discussion revolves around personal finance and the importance of learning about the stock market. One speaker shares a negative experience with the stock market due to trading on tips rather than doing research on financial fundamentals. The speakers advise starting with long-term investing and learning the basics of the stock market. They recommend starting small and experimenting with a small amount of money that one can afford to lose to gain experience and increase self-awareness.

But again, the thing is that around us, we're using a lot of products from the US stock market. I'm watching and bingeing on Netflix. I'm using my MacBook to watch Netflix on. I'm using the Adobe products, the Premiere Pro, the Photoshop. And he's also combining Adobe, MacBook and Netflix to finally use the fourth product, which is Durex. Like... What? What? What? What the... There's a lot of companies listed on the US stock market, which have products that we use on a daily basis. So if I'm a daily user of these products, why not also be part of their growth journeys? Because I see people around me using them all the time. They're truly global companies and brands. So there is a lot of growth potential in this market, very specifically as well. Yeah. That's the whole reason why we personally invest in the US stock market as well. We bought shares of Apple, Google, Netflix and whatnot. Remember, one thing I've learned through the podcasting journey is that if you want to make money in life, in business, in the stock market, scan your own days, scan your own week, ask yourself what are the brands you use? What are the products you use? Study those products. Ask yourself if you can be a part of those products. That's where this thought is coming from in the first place, which is also why this particular video is brought to you by IND Money. It's an app we use to invest in the US stock market. Very smooth. It's kind of changed the game for us. We didn't have these kind of apps growing up. We're actually happy that after we started earning money, apps like this have come to the forefront. But you guys are living in a different time. While we may be five years apart, I'm 28, you might be 23, you're a different generation. The opportunities are fresh, the opportunities are new, and your job is to know about those opportunities, know about those money-making possibilities so that when you're 28, you guys live a better life than we are living right now. Absolutely. And just to get you started on this journey, let's assume you're 22, 23, or even 30, but you've not invested in your first US stock yet. We're coming and giving you 100 rupees worth of free Apple stock. Just when you use this coupon code to download the IND Money app, which is BB Apple, you will be able to get 100 rupees worth of free Apple stock to your name. Why not use it?

While we spoke about scanning products around you, scanning.","The discussion revolves around the benefits of investing in the US stock market, specifically in companies that offer products used in daily life, such as Apple, Google, Netflix, and Adobe. The speakers highlight the growth potential of these companies and encourage the audience to invest in them using the IND Money app, which offers commission-free investing. They also offer a coupon code for free Apple stock to get started. The discussion emphasizes the importance of being aware of money-making possibilities and seizing them to live a better life."

Ensure that you invest but also ensure that you spend like on the right things. On things that truly make you happy. Yeah. And finally maybe we can end with very very rapid mistakes that we've made when it comes to money. Maybe in one or two sentences we'll play a ping pong of mistakes. Viraj, you go first. Mistake number one, I invested in some US stocks which I went terribly wrong with purely because I used it on a tip. One of my friends said that hey Chinese stocks are going to go through the roof. Invest in them, this was during the COVID period. But there was a big crackdown on billionaires by the Chinese government and all the Chinese stocks went super low. Alibaba, Baidu, what not. I lost a lot of money and I sold them for a loss. Okay. So for me the mistake I made was I had a very deep seated fear about getting into personal finance. I just thought it's a skill which will take me very long to learn and it will be very difficult for me to learn. And I say the same thing about coding as well, right? So maybe I'll say the same thing about coding or mathematics. You've just got this mental block against it. But once you get to it, once you've got a friend to explain it to you, trust me, it becomes a lot easier. It's a lot more difficult in your own head. So I wish I'd invested earlier, ideally in college. Yeah, just one other mistake is stop timing the market. Oh, this is at a peak, the market is at a peak. I should not invest, I should wait for later. Bitcoin is at a peak, Reliance stock is at a peak, ITC is at a peak, Sensex is at a peak. I will not invest now, I will invest later. But the market just keeps going up, going up. The only way to tackle this is stop timing the market, just keep investing small amounts every month. Next mistake from my end, staying away from Twitter for a very long time. You won't believe how much of a self-improvement journey Twitter can create for you if you follow the right accounts. Mostly people think Twitter is political or Twitter is negative. You are missing out. Please open yourself up to Twitter. Even now we get a lot of our financial inputs and directions through the world of the correct Twitter accounts. Absolutely. So this is what it was with regards to our mistakes. Bottom line, be smart with your investments, start your investing journey and again, we've got that 100 rupees of free Apple stock for you. The code is BBAPPLE, use it, explore it, make money and so will we.","In the discussion, the importance of balancing investments and expenses was emphasized, and it was recommended to spend money on things that truly bring happiness. The participants also shared some mistakes they made with their personal finance, such as investing based on tips and avoiding learning about personal finance due to a mental block. They advised against timing the market and suggested investing small amounts regularly. Additionally, they recommended utilizing Twitter for financial education and following the right accounts. Finally, they offered a code for 100 rupees of free Apple stock to encourage listeners to start their investing journey."

It's going to be a completely free course, pretty long. But if you guys want to learn everything there is about investing and you want a really good grasp on how to analyze a stock, how to set up a brokerage account, as well as my tips and techniques for making me most amount of money you can while investing, then this is the video for you. So let's go over some of the things we're going to go over in this really in-depth course. So the first thing we're going over is what the stock market is. We're also going to talk about what exactly are stocks and how they actually make people money, right? When you buy it and you sell them, how you actually make money doing that. We'll also go into the different types of stocks that you can buy because it's not so simple. There are many different types of stocks you can buy and suddenly something really important that you should know before you start investing. We'll also go over the easiest way to open up a brokerage account. So we'll be going through a couple of my favorite platforms to use and how you can actually get some free stocks doing that as well. We'll go into the different types of accounts that you can use to buy and invest in stocks. A lot of people think there's only one type of stock account that you can use to buy stocks, but that's not true. There are so many different types. So we'll go over those. We'll go into timing the market. If it's a good thing to do, if it's a bad thing to do, best ways to do stock research, you guys, people have different ways of analyzing stocks and determining what stocks they want to buy. And there really isn't a completely right way to do it, but I will go into a couple of different types of ways that you can do your own stock research. And that brings us to key terms. These are terms that you definitely should know before investing, and they will help you actually evaluate different companies and be able to compare different companies with one another. We're going to be two top ways to make money with stocks. And then we'll also go into dealing with all the taxes that come with investing. Right. Anytime you buy something and sell it and realize a gain, or even when you realize a loss, there are tax implications and you'll want to know these things before you start investing. We'll also go into value versus momentum investing. And we'll also talk about Warren Buffett's principles of investing. Warren Buffett is one of the most prolific investors of our time. And it's really insightful to go over what his principles are when looking for companies to buy and sell. We'll talk about how long you should hold stocks for. It really depends on you and what your whole situation is. We'll go over the importance of investing early. This is super important. You'll see as I show you examples, why it makes so much sense to invest as early as you can. So if you guys haven't started investing and you're watching this video right now, that is why I really recommend watch this video all the way through, get a good grasp on investing and then open up your brokerage account today. Of course, we'll also talk about how much money you should invest. This really depends on your whole financial situation, but there are some rules that you can follow that allow you to invest a good chunk of your money, but not all of your money. And that helps you diversify your holdings and not have all your eggs in one basket. Of course, we'll also talk about how you can do your own due diligence before investing in stocks. This is very important. Anytime you listen to someone say, buy the stock, buy that stock, you have to do your own research before actually buying it because it's your money and you need to ultimately make the final decision of whether or not you want to buy a stock. So I know that's a lot, but these are some of the things we'll cover in this video. And yeah, I'm really excited to present all this information. It's completely free. It doesn't cost any money. I know there are a lot of paid courses out there for investing, but to be honest, like a lot of the things you're going to be learning, you can do them on your own and you can just learn them from this video right here. So just a little background about myself. I am a real estate broker and I am also a serial entrepreneur running different businesses and all different sorts of industries. I have seven years of investing experience and I'm also an active investing slash personal finance YouTuber. So basically I've been making a lot of content about different companies, my recommendations for some of the top stocks you can buy. And overall, I'm just a really big believer in learning about the fundamentals of investing. When you buy and hold stock for the longterm, it's such a great way to build wealth. I think it's something that everyone in the whole world should do. And yeah, I've seen a lot of people get really rich from investing. So that's just why I really want to emphasize how important investing is to anyone. So let's first talk about why you should invest in the stock market ASAP, right? There's a lot of potential to make money in the stock market. Now, since the 1800s, we've seen that the average return on your investment happens to be around 7% per year. And you guys, this is not guaranteed. This is just based on the past. So it doesn't guarantee that this is going to happen in the future, but, you know, looking at these types of returns, that's pretty good. That's a lot better than having your money sit in a bank account and not really getting any interest. Now, personally, I do believe that longterm investing is a lot safer. It's not a hundred percent safe, but it certainly is more safe than day trading, than swing trading and all that stuff. And when you're investing your money, you're basically letting your money work for you, right? You can go off and work your nine to five job or whatever job you have and make money doing that. You're trading your time for money. But when you invest, you're actually just letting the fact that you have money, make money for you. It's a pretty cool thing. And that's why I would consider it pretty passive income. Another reason why you should invest as soon as possible is because you want to hedge against inflation, right? Each year, inflation tends to run about between two to 3%. And that means that your money is losing value over time. So if you want your money to make money, you're going to need it to grow faster than inflation. So like I mentioned before versus how","The discussion is a free online course on how to invest in stocks for beginners, covering topics such as what the stock market is, what stocks are and how they make money, different types of stocks, brokerage account set up, types of accounts for investing, timing the market, conducting stock research, key terms for evaluating companies, two top ways to make money with stocks, dealing with taxes, value versus momentum investing, Warren Buffet's principles of investing, holding stocks for the long term, and the importance of investing early. The course also covers how much money to invest, due diligence before investing, and the potential to make money in the stock market."

Investing your money instead, if it gets that average return of 7%, which we have seen historically, that is going to really grow your money. We'll talk about compound interest and compound growth later on, but it's going to grow a lot faster than if you just sit on your money in a bank account. Stocks aren't the only way that you can make money, right? There's also real estate that you can invest in, and there are tons of other assets that you can invest your money in and actually generate money. If you guys take a look at the screen on the slide, this is the S&P 500 for the last about 40 years. You can see the growth on that green line. It's been going up pretty consistently. We do have some big corrections every once in a while. Yeah, you can see that obviously it's grown a lot, and that's just pretty much the whole point of investing. You're putting your money to work and it's growing for you long term. What are the reasons for people to invest? Why do people actually want to invest? Well, obviously you want to make more money, but the number one reason is for retirement. We see that a lot of people, they don't save enough money for retirement, and then when they're retired, they start to run out of money and they run into a lot of problems. The top reasons that people say that they invest is 64% say it's for retirement, 56% say it's for living comfortably, 53% for feeling financially secure, and then 44% for maximizing their wealth. However, almost half of people say that they don't save enough money, they don't invest enough money, and it's something that they want to do more of. 39% expect to be forced to work beyond retirement age, and that's something you really don't want to do. And crazily enough, 12% of people don't contribute to any retirement fund at all, which when I hear that, it's just, I get scared for them. And I just want everyone to be financially secure, and especially when they're older and it's a little bit hard to work. So what is the stock market? The stock market is a marketplace where buyers and sellers can trade shares in companies. So this is regulated by the SEC, and this is in the United States. And the SEC stands for the Securities and Exchange Commission, right? Their whole job is to protect the public, promote fairness, and maintain efficient markets. The companies that are traded in the stock market are all publicly traded companies. These are companies that outside retail investors can go ahead and buy shares of. And when this happens, the owners of that company are diluting their personal equity in exchange for capital. So instead of raising money through venture capital funds and all that stuff, they can actually go to retail investors. So that's like me and you, people who can buy shares on their computer or on their phone, and they can raise money that way. That's the whole point of the stock market. Now let me tell you guys about what an IPO is. This stands for Initial Public Offering. And basically what happens here is an investment bank underwrites the IPO, and they buy up a ton of the shares, so they're taking the risk. And then they're selling those shares on the market for a fee, and that's basically based on the percentage of share price. So when you have a private company that is not yet publicly traded, and they want to actually be listed on the stock exchanges, that's when they're going to do this IPO. And right now there are 13 different exchanges in the US. Some of the big ones are the New York Stock Exchange, NYSE, and the NASDAQ, and that is heavily tech focused. So like I said, the stock market allows individual investors like me and you to buy and sell in a regulated environment. And it's basically like an auction. Let's go over what the definition of a stock is. So basically a stock is a piece of a company. I know it sounds a little bit weird, but it's basically your share of ownership in a corporation, a type of currency that is backed by that company. You have units of stock and those are called shares, and these corporations are going to issue stock to raise funds to operate their business. So let's say you have company A, they have 20 shares available for the company, and you own four of those 20 shares. That means that you're going to have 20% ownership in this company, and that means that you're going to have 20% of the profits. Now it doesn't necessarily mean that you're going to get paid up 20% of the profits. Some companies are more dividend focused companies and they will pay out a big share of their profits. But for most companies, they're going to, rather than paying those profits out to their investors, they're going to reinvest it into the business. Basically you're making money because the company does well and then the share price goes up. The share price is really based on the earnings, the performance, as well as the sentiment in the market. So now let's talk about the different types of stock that there are available. The first is common stock. This is the most common type of stock there is, and basically you're having ownership in a company and a right to vote. It also allows you access to dividends, being paid out dividends, and these are variable. These are not guaranteed. Some years you might get a dividend if the company is performing well. Some years if the market is crashing or if that company is just not doing well, they might suspend that dividend. The common stock is what most of you guys are going to be buying in the stock market. I only own common stock and I don't have any preferred stock, which is what we're going to be talking about next. So for preferred stock, these types of shares don't give you any voting rights. They give you a more stable dividend and you actually have a bit of priority. So if there is a bankruptcy, you're going to get paid out first in that case and it's harder to lose or gain value. So these types of shares are not as volatile as common stock. So like I said, common stock, that is what you and I will be trading. And there are 600,000 or more publicly traded companies in the world.","The discussion is about the importance of investing in stocks and other assets for financial security and retirement. The speaker points out that investing has historically yielded higher returns than savings accounts and that there are various types of assets besides stocks that can be invested in. They also explain what the stock market is, how it works, and what an IPO is. A stock represents a share of ownership in a corporation, and owning shares allows investors to receive a portion of profits and vote on company decisions. The speaker also mentions the different types of stock available, with common stock being the most common and giving owners the right to vote and access to variable dividends."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giGcuofIYis_sep_646_930,giGcuofIYis_sep_646_930,"You can also categorize stocks based on how big the company is. So you have small cap companies, you have mid cap companies, and you have large cap companies. For small cap companies, I'd say that the market value is normally under $2 billion. For mid cap companies, these are those medium sized companies, the market cap will generally be between $2 to $10 billion. And then for large cap companies, that is when the market cap is going to be $10 billion or more. You can also categorize stocks based on the sector that they're in. So you have tech stocks, you have energy stocks, you have auto stocks, you have medical stocks, all that stuff, right? You can also categorize them by location. So where in the world that company is based from. And also you can categorize different stocks as either growth companies or value companies. And you don't have to just buy shares of individual companies. You can actually purchase shares of ETFs. And that's basically going to be tracking these indexes where you're basically buying a small portion of a bunch of different companies. And very similar thing with mutual funds. It's just like a more diversified holding where you buy one share of something and then that is basically like investing in a ton of different companies. So really when people are saying to diversify in your stocks, that means you're diversifying across different sectors from different locations and also buying growth as well as value stocks. Now let's talk about risk tolerance. And for investing, there's always going to be a small level of risk involved. So you have your most safe way of, I guess, holding your money and that's in cash. That's not going to grow. That's going to actually lose value with inflation. Then you have bonds. Bonds are probably the safest way that you can actually sort of invest your money and get a small return. Then you have index funds. So like I said, these are tracking indexes and you're investing in a whole bunch of different companies. And that's why the risk is a bit less than buying individual stocks, which is our next one. This is a bit riskier because if a company goes out of business, then you could lose all your money. Real estate is a bit more risky than stocks. Generally, it really depends on how you trade stocks. But for long term investing in stocks, that is generally going to be quite a bit safer than the real estate. There are a lot of things that can go wrong in real estate. And yeah, that's why I'd say real estate is a bit more risky than stocks in general. And then even riskier than real estate, I'd say, is trading in cryptocurrencies. We've seen cryptocurrencies really boom in the last year, but it is still very risky. It's still very volatile. There are different subcategories of each of these that are more or less risky than others. But I'd say this is the general risk profile of each of these types of investments. So just for fun, I kind of want to take you guys through one of my favorite ETFs. This is the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF called VOO. I own a lot of this ETF. And when you're buying the stock, you're basically buying into the S&P 500. You're investing into the top 500 companies in the US. So for most people that invest in stocks, I'd say that if you want to be safe, if you want to just do long term investing, then VOO is a really great choice because you're investing, like I said, in those 500 or so companies. And it's basically like investing in the US economy as a whole. With the S&P 500, these companies are historically seen to grow more than, you know, like a total stock market index, because instead of investing in, let's say over 3,000 different companies, this index is only on the top 500 companies. But yeah, I just wanted to show you guys one of these companies that I'm heavily invested in and definitely one to consider if you are investing as well. So let's talk about the different types of brokerage accounts, right? Like I said, there's not only one type of account that you can invest your money in. There's quite a few. We'll start with the taxable account. This is the most standard account. It's the one that most people are going to be starting off with. And with this account, you're going to be paying taxes on any of the gains you make with your stocks. So let's say you buy a stock for $10, you sell it for $2, you're going to have a $2 taxable gain and you will have to pay taxes on that. With the standard taxable account, you can purchase stocks, you can purchase mutual funds, ETFs, pretty much anything. And within the standard account, you can have a cash account and also a margin account. The cash account is basically letting you buy investments with money that you deposit into the account. You can take $5,000, put it into that cash account and then use that cash to purchase different stocks. With the margin account, this lets you actually borrow money from your broker to buy investments. This is a lot riskier. It's something that is more advanced. So I'm not going to be talking about too much in this video, but just know that you do have that option when trading with a standard taxable account. And there are no limits to how much money you can actually put into a standard taxable account. So yeah, a lot of people are going to be trading with this type of account. You also have retirement accounts and these is is is is is is is is","This discussion covers various aspects of finance, including categorizing stocks based on company size, sector, location, and growth/value. It also touches upon different types of investments, their risk profiles, and brokerage accounts. The discussion explains how to invest in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds, which offer diversified holdings in various companies. It also explains the risk levels of different types of investments, ranging from cash (which is safe but doesn't grow) to bonds (which are relatively safe) to stocks (which can be riskier, especially when investing in individual companies) to real estate (which can be riskier than stocks). Lastly, the discussion covers brokerage accounts, including the standard taxable account and retirement accounts like individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and 401(k)s."

So you're paying basically half the amount of taxes as a standard taxable account I know it's a little bit confusing but the money you put into your standard taxable account It's money that you're paying that you have paid taxes on already and then you have to pay taxes again on any of that Profit with a retirement account. You're only paying taxes once so for example with a 401k This is a retirement account that a lot of people have the money that they put into that account They aren't paying taxes on it. They're actually reducing their taxable income for that year and hence not paying taxes However with that traditional 401k when you do take out the money later on you will be taxed on any profits on the reverse Side you have things like the Roth IRA. This is money that you put in post-tax So you're not actually reducing your taxable income But when you go to take out the profits later on you're not going to be paying any taxes There are some contribution limits to these types of accounts So you can't put unlimited funds into them and there are definitely some withdrawal rules which make these a little bit more complicated But for most people they're gonna have both a standard taxable account as well as a type of retirement account And we won't go to too much of these in detail, but you also have your health savings account You have your 529 savings plan You have your custodial brokerage account if you're under the age of 18 But still want to invest and you have robo-advisors and we'll talk more about those later on but that's also another great way To invest your money So let's get into how you can actually start opening up your first standard brokerage account and this is going to allow you to Buy and sell stocks now. There are tons of different Brokerage platforms that you can use out there. For example, there's Robin Hood. There's Weibull There's TD Ameritrade, Fidelity, Charles Schwab and many more. Now I will say that for beginners I will typically recommend using an app based brokerage because these are extremely easy to use They have great interfaces and it allows you to just bust out your phone and trade whenever you want So it really gets over that hump of you know Having trading being somewhat hard and complicated and makes it a lot easier which will increase your chances of Investing more money and hence making more money. Now with Robin Hood and Weibull You can actually get some free stocks if you open up an account So I will put a link to those in the description below and if you do use those links You will be helping support the channel. So thank you so much in advance So when you are opening up a standard brokerage account through let's say Robin Hood or Weibull There is no minimum account balance so you can literally just open up the account put in one dollar and start trading with that They're super easy to open but I will say that you have to be 18 or older to open up an account with these now The alternative to opening up one of those standard brokerage accounts through Robin Hood or Weibull or whatever is to open up a robo-advisor Account this basically allows you to passively invest without having to buy or sell individual stocks So one great option for this you guys is Wealthfront. They are a fantastic company and really one of the most popular robo-advisors out there So yeah for Wealthfront It's a great option for beginners since you know, you have the PhDs the really smart people at Wealthfront doing all the work for you You can actually get $5,000 managed for free when you open up an account using my link in the description below There is a $500 account minimum So you will have to invest at least $500 and super easy to set up takes under five minutes to do so and Like the other accounts you do need to be 18 or older It's now going back to the standard brokerage account if you guys do want to start opening up an account today I'll just show you guys sort of what the application process is like first You want to go to the links in the description below and then click on them and set up an account and get your free Stocks basically what they're gonna be asking you is to submit an application and this is only going to take a few minutes So they'll be asking for a lot of personal information So things like your social security number your address your name your date of birth and some other things They'll have you set up a username and password So you'll want to make sure that that is super secure You might want to turn on two-factor authentication or something like that And then they'll be verifying your identity using the information that you give them after that You'll wait for your application to be approved and then once that is approved. It should be pretty quick You can actually start to fund your account put money into it and then you can start trading right away So I'm actually gonna take you guys through Robin Hood and just show you the whole platform So you get a good feel of what this platform is like. So I've opened up Robin Hood right here. This is my main dashboard It's gonna show you how much money you have invested So right now I have about sixty nine thousand in this account It's gonna show you sort of like what the value of your account has been throughout the day And you can kind of scroll through like that. So it's pretty cool You can also change this so it's showing you the last week last month last three months and so on right It's also going to have your buying power right here So this is the cash that is in your account, but is not yet actively invested into different stocks, right? So right now I have about five thousand dollars that I can use to actually purchase stocks down here It's gonna be all your stocks that you have your whole portfolio in this account So you can see I have Microsoft Netflix Disney Tesla a bunch more","This discussion is about personal finance.

Additionally, the speaker talks about Wealthfront, a popular robo-advisor, that allows people to passively invest without buying or selling individual stocks. The speaker also provides some links to get free stocks and discounts when opening these accounts."

I can show you guys the one week value, the one month value, last three months. It's going to show you your position, your average cost. So that means that my average cost for Microsoft was $203.84. The market value, the portfolio diversity, and then your total return. Now I can go out of this and I want to actually show you guys this main screen right here, the browse screen. So this is pretty cool in Robinhood because you can actually look at a bunch of these popular lists of stocks. So let's say I want to look at a hundred most popular, right? It's going to show me a hundred of the most popular stocks on Robinhood that people are buying through this app. And yeah, just a cool way to see them. You can sort by symbol, by price and by the percent change. I could also maybe look at crypto. So if you didn't you can buy crypto currencies on here as well. This is the list that they have. And yeah, just a bunch of other lists here. And they also have news articles. So if you want to stay up to date with sort of the whole news, the whole market, you can just come here and look at all these articles from a bunch of different publishers. And you can see the top movers for the day. So you can see this company was up 60% crazy. This company is down 46%. Also completely crazy. And yeah, just a great place to sort of get your news on what's happening in the economy and in the stock market. So let's say you want to buy a stock, right? Let's say I want to buy a share of let's say Microsoft, right? This is always a great company to buy. So I'm going to come to the Microsoft screen right here. I'm going to click trade and I'm going to click buy right here. You can see that I could also have clicked sell if I want to sell some of my shares. That shows me I have about $5,000 available. I'm just going to ask me the number of shares I want to buy. It's going to tell me the current market price and it's going to tell me the estimated cost. Now if you guys go up here, you can actually see that you can make market orders. You can actually do a bunch of different other types of orders such as the limit order, trailing stop order, all this stuff. These are a little bit more complicated. So right now I'm just going to show you guys what it looks like for a market order. Let's say I want to buy one share like I'm going to click review and I'm just going to swipe up to buy that. Now I'm not actually going to buy that right now. So I'm going to go back, but let me show you guys how to do a limit order. And this is a really great way to set a maximum price you want to buy Microsoft for. So let's say I don't want to pay more than let's say $230, right? So I'm going to set that $230. I'm going to click continue and I'm going to select what the trading hours are. So we'll just use market hours. Continue. I'm going to say that this order is good for today only until 1pm. Continue. And then basically what's going to happen is it's only going to purchase Microsoft if the price hits $230 or lower. If it doesn't, then my order is not going to execute and I won't buy the shares. So this is a bit slower to buy. We'll talk more about this later on, but that's pretty much how you set a limit So that gives you a glimpse of what Robinhood is like. I'm also going to take you guys through Webull. This is another great stock trading app. So this is my Webull account. I can go here and this is basically my main dashboard. It's going to have my account value here at the top. It's going to, and I'm going to be able to change to see the last month, last three months and so on. Right? So my current market value is about $58,000. I have a cash balance of $666. So that means that I have $666 I can use to buy stocks right now. And I can come down here and these are some of my positions in this account. So this is where I have some of my more risky stock picks. So let's say I want to click on rocket companies. Right? Cool. So this is rocket companies. It shows me my profit and loss for this company. So right now I've made about $280 from these shares. I have a market value of $4,300. So I have that much of rocket stock and also shows me my past orders. So I bought 190 shares at 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21,","The discussion describes two popular stock trading apps, Robinhood and Webull. The speaker demonstrates the features of Robinhood, such as viewing stock prices and news articles, buying and selling stocks, and setting limit orders. The speaker also shows their Webull account, which displays their account value, cash balance, and current stock positions. The speaker then clicks on Rocket Companies, displaying their profit and loss for the company, as well as past orders.

So right now it's set as standard as a limit order. So I can set what I want my limit price to be using this. I can set the quantity using this and time and force, extended hours, all that stuff. If I want to do a market order a little bit easier, I can just go that here. You'll see, I don't need to set a limit price or anything like that. And I'll just select how many shares I want to buy and I can click the buy button. Same thing if I want to sell, I can do a market sell or I can do a limit sell as well. Weeble also has a watch list where you can put different companies that you're actually watching. And they also have a few cool places where you can see some of the top gainers, some of the top losers for today, some of the most active stocks, best performing industries. They have crypto as well, so you can trade cryptocurrencies on here. You can also go to explore and it's basically going to have a bunch of these cool things here that you can check out. I don't look at this too much, but yeah. The community tab is also very cool. They have news here. They always have competitions with paper trading and stuff like that. They also have news, so very similar to Robinhood. You can check out a bunch of news about the stock market and the economy here. And yeah, it's a great platform. So yeah, if you guys are interested in either Robinhood or Weeble, I'll put those links down below. So outside of using Robinhood and Weeble, let's talk about robo-advisors because this is a really great way for people to invest that a lot of people don't talk about. I know I sort of mentioned it earlier, but I want to give you guys some more details on what robo-advisors actually are and how they can help you make money. So basically robo-advisors are passive investing platforms that help you invest your money for you. So it's very hands-off. You'll need to be constantly checking your portfolio, buying and selling and doing all that. So it is very automated. And basically these robo-advisors are using algorithms to help you invest for you. They're really inexpensive and they are algorithm-based financial advisors that are perfect for people who don't want to spend their time following the market. So people that want to be extremely passive investors and not active traders. They'll generally require a lot less capital to start than let's say using a human financial advisor and the annual fees for robo-advisors are much less. So they'll generally be between 0.25 to 0.5% per year versus 1% for a human financial advisor. And Wealthfront is my top pick for robo-advisors. It's the one that most people use. So if you guys are looking for a robo-advisor, I highly recommend going with them. I'll have their link in the description below. But basically with Wealthfront, you're investing in low cost ETFs, right? This is a lot more diversified. It's a lot more safe. And they're basically going to help you build a custom diversified portfolio investments that cater to your needs. And with Wealthfront, you can actually open up a bunch of different accounts. You can open up your standard brokerage account that's taxable. You can open up retirement accounts. You can open up education accounts, all that stuff, right? So you have your Roth, traditional rollover, SEP IRAs, Trust, 529 college savings plans, and cash account. And right now I think their cash account is paying 0.35% APY, which is a lot better than most online banks. So that's also another option. Now for their annual fee, they charge 0.25%. And if you guys use my link below, you're going to get your first $5,000 managed for free. And yeah, it's just a really great way to invest. And I'm actually going to show you guys a screen share of what their accounts look like on your phone. So if you open up Wealthfront, it's going to show you your main dashboard. It's going to show your net worth today. And it's also going to show you your net worth at retirement. So this is the projected net worth based on all your assets, all that stuff. So if you scroll down there, it's going to show you your cash accounts. It's also going to show your investment accounts. And if we click on the personal investment account right there, it's going to show you how much money you have invested with them. Right now you can see in this account, $78,000. It's going to show you your line of credit, your tax loss, harvesting, your diversified portfolio. So US stocks, foreign stocks, all that stuff. So yeah, if you click on US stocks, it's going to show you your target allocation, your market value, and what things are in it. So VTI, SCHB. So now let's talk about the different types of trades you have when investing in the stock market. The first one is the market order. The second one is the limit order. And the third is the stop order. With the market order, sort of like I showed you guys on Robinhood and Webull, this is when you're buying or selling at the best available price in the current market. So basically the current price as of right now. It's the fastest way to buy or sell, and it's the most basic way to buy and sell stocks. So essentially you're buying at the current asking price, or you're selling at the bid price. Now, on the other hand, with the limit order, this is when you're buying or selling at a specified price that you get to choose. So let's say you have a stock where the current market price is, let's say $18. If you were to do a market order, if you were to do a market buy, then you'd be buying that stock at $18 right now. If you do want to do a limit order to buy that stock, you'd set a limit order to let's say $15. This means that it's only going to execute and purchase those shares at $15. So it'll need to drop to that price for it to execute. The risk with this is that it might not execute because the share price might not drop from $18 to $15. You could have a limit order for let's say...","The discussion covers various investment platforms and tools for investors. The speaker talks about two trading platforms, Robinhood and Weeble, explaining their features and how to use them. Additionally, they discuss robo-advisors, which are passive investment platforms that use algorithms to invest on behalf of their clients. The speaker recommends Wealthfront as their top pick for robo-advisors, citing their low fees and diversification strategies. Finally, the speaker explains the three types of trades in the stock market: market orders, limit orders, and stop orders."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giGcuofIYis_sep_1821_2102,giGcuofIYis_sep_1821_2102,"and 90 cents, there's a pretty good chance that that is going to execute because it might just drop down 10 cents and then it will execute that order. Now if you set a sell limit, let's say for $20, that means it's only going to sell that stock not at $18, but at $20. So it has to rise to $20. And the risk with this is that it might not execute as well, right? Like it might not hit $20. It might actually keep dropping down and you would have come out ahead just selling it at that current market price of $18. You also have your stop order. This is a bit more complicated, but this is basically going to help you buy or sell when the price moves past a specified price. So now that we've talked about the different types of orders, let's talk about how you can research stocks. And there are definitely some very important metrics to understand. First of course is your price. This is the cost to purchase one share of that company, but that price itself needs some context because you're not going to know how many shares there are in total by just looking at the price. What you need to do is you need to know how many shares there are in total. And what you'll do is you'll multiply the price by the number of shares in total to get the market cap. The next thing you can look at is the 52 week low and high. So this is the lowest price that that company hit in the last 52 weeks and the highest price that the company hit in the last 52 weeks. So it just gives you some context as to where the share price is currently. You also have your trading volume. So this is the quantity of shares that are traded during a given period. Now when you have high volume, this means that a lot of people are trading it right now. And what I recommend doing with this is you want to pair it with the trend of that price. So if the price is going up and lots of people are trading, then there is some upward momentum and you might be able to expect it to keep going up for at least a little bit. If there's a lot of trading volume and the price is going down, then that means that there's downward momentum and that could mean that the price continues trending downward. Another key term is beta and this is the stock's volatility in relation to the overall market. So basically a beta of under one means that the stock is less volatile than the current market and a beta of over one means that it's more volatile. And you have the PE ratio, which stands for price to earnings ratio. What this is, is it's the price per share divided by the annual earnings per share. And that annual earnings per share, I know it's a little bit confusing, but that is the total earnings divided by the total shares outstanding. So let's go into an example about the PE ratio, right? So let's say you have a company that hit a hundred thousand dollars in earnings last year and it's valued at one million dollars and it sells for one million dollars. This means that the PE ratio is 10 because you take your one million dollars divided by a hundred K and that gives you 10. What this does is it allows you to compare this company with other companies based on the price and how much money the business is earning. So let's say you have another company that hits $200,000 in earnings and sells for $1.5 million. If you take 1.5 million divided by 200 K, that gives you a PE ratio of 7.5. So for these two companies, even though one of them did more earnings, you can see that the PE ratio for that one is smaller, which means that technically based on the PE ratio, that 200 K earning company is the better deal. The higher this PE ratio, the more future growth is already baked into the price. So we've been seeing a lot of companies that have PE ratios above 50, even above 100, even close to a thousand. And this means that the valuation of that company is just a lot higher than the annual earnings of that company. I'd say right now, any PE ratio that's under 20 is considered pretty low and it means that the company is valued pretty much where its book value is at. Another really important metric to understand is the PEG ratio. This is the price to earnings to growth ratio. To calculate this, you're taking the PE ratio, which we just talked about, and you're dividing it by the growth rate of its earnings for a time period. This is going to help you value a stock while factoring in any expected earnings growth. And it's a more standardized way of comparing companies with different growth projections. Now with the PEG ratio, the lower, the better. So if you have a PEG ratio of under one, this means that technically this company could be undervalued. And if the PEG ratio is over one, that means it's technically overvalued. So an example of a PEG ratio, let's say you have company one, the current price per share is $10 and the earnings per share this year is $1. However, the earnings per share one year ago was 66 cents. So with this, if you do the calculations for the PE ratio, it comes out at 10. Now we need to calculate the earnings growth rate. And what we do is we take the earnings per share of this year, so $1 and we divide it by the earnings per share last year, which is 66 cents. If you do that and subtract one, that gives you 0.52, AKA 52%. And then 5% and then 5% and then 5%","The discussion covers various metrics and techniques for stock trading. It starts by discussing different types of stock orders such as market order, sell limit, and stop order. Then it moves on to explain different metrics to research stocks, including price, market cap, 52-week high/low, trading volume, beta, PE ratio, and PEG ratio. The discussion provides examples to explain how to calculate these metrics and how to interpret them to make informed trading decisions. Finally, the discussion highlights the importance of factoring in expected earnings growth while evaluating a stock's value and suggests that a lower PEG ratio could indicate an undervalued stock."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giGcuofIYis_sep_2103_2415,giGcuofIYis_sep_2103_2415,"we take the P-E ratio, which we calculated, which was 10, and you divide that by 52 and you get 0.19. This is a very low PEG ratio, which means that it could be undervalued. Another important metric to understand is the dividend yield. So this is how much a company pays out dividends each year compared to its stock price. To calculate this, you're gonna take the annual dividends per share and divide that by the share price. And this is gonna be expressed as a percentage. Let's say, for example, you have a company and the share price is, let's say, $10, right? If the dividend yield for that company is, let's say, 5%, that means that that company is gonna be paying out 50 cents in dividends per year. I'd say that any dividend above 3% or 4% means it's a pretty high dividend stock. Any dividend between, let's say, 1% and 2% means it's a mild dividend stock. And then there are a lot of companies out there that just do not pay dividends. Another great metric to learn is the price to book ratio. And what you do for this is you take the stock price and you divide it by the book value per share. This helps tell us the market valuation of a company, which is usually higher, versus its book value. And the book value is found from the net assets of a company. So basically, you're taking your assets minus your debt and that gives you your book value. If you have a price to book ratio of under one, that is considered good. And if you have a price to book ratio of over one, that technically means that it could be overvalued. Another very important metric is your profit margin. And this is your profit per dollar of revenue expressed as a percentage. So let's say you have a company and they have a 20% profit margin, right? This means that for each $1 of sales, that means they are getting a net income of 20 cents. Another thing to know is your return on equity. This is the ROE, and it's basically calculating your return on net assets. It's pretty complicated to actually understand what goes into calculating this, but basically it measures the financial performance of a company. What you're gonna do is you're gonna take the net income and you're gonna divide it by the shareholders' equity. A return on equity of 15% and up is considered good, but it really does depend on the sector. Another very important metric that I always look at is the current ratio. And this is basically the current assets divided by the current liabilities. The current ratio is basically going to measure the short-term liquidity of a company. And what I like to do when evaluating companies is I like to see a current ratio that is above one. This means that they have more current assets than they have current liabilities. And that means that the company does have enough cash to pay off any debts in the short-term. However, if the current ratio is way too high, let's say above five or 10, this could mean that maybe they aren't using their assets efficiently. So there should be a good balance, but if this number is under one, this does mean that they are in sort of a precarious situation where they have more liabilities than they have short-term actual assets. So now that we've gone through all these different types of metrics, I wanna actually take you guys through a stock and put these to use. So I have pulled up Apple stock, one of the most popular stocks out there with the highest market caps. And I'm on Yahoo Finance. And if you come here, this is gonna show you the current stock price, so what it's trading at. If you wanted to buy Apple right now, it'd be at $123.21. It's always changing because the market is still open right now. Come down here and you can see the 52-week range. So in the last 52 weeks, it's been as low as $53.15, but as high as $145.09. So that just gives you some context as to the current price, right? You can see the volume right here and the average volume. And then you have your market cap. So this is your current price multiplied by all the outstanding shares, and that's $2.069 trillion. So large cap company, absolutely gigantic. You have your beta, so 1.25, meaning it is a little bit more volatile than the market. You have a PE ratio of 33.43. So just based off that number, it is a little bit overvalued if you look at it through a PE ratio standpoint. The earnings per share is $3.69. That means that for each share that you have, they are earning $3.69 per year. The dividend yield is right here, so it's expressed as a percentage, so 0.68%, meaning this is a very small, mild dividend stock. And for each share that you have, you're gonna get 82 cents as a dividend as of right now. If you come here to the chart, you can see in the last year, this is the price movement. So obviously a lot of growth, but a little bit of a correction right there in recent months. And if you come here to statistics, this is where you can see a bunch of the other valuation measures and metrics. Market cap right here. We talked about the PEG ratio. So this is the five-year expected PEG ratio of 2.76. It is above one, so technically it is overvalued. Then you have your price to sales and price to book ratios right here. Price to book ratio is 31.63, which is pretty high. So it is overvalued. Then we come down here to the profitability. So you have your profit margin is at 21.74%, which is pretty good. You wanna compare that to the industry. So this is in the tech industry, so I'm not sure what the average is, but you can do that research if you want. You have your return on equity, which we talked about, the ROE, sitting at 82.09%.","The discussion provides an overview of important financial metrics that investors use to analyze stocks. The PEG ratio is calculated by dividing the P/E ratio by the earnings growth rate, and a low PEG ratio may indicate an undervalued stock. Dividend yield is expressed as a percentage and is calculated by dividing annual dividends per share by the share price. A high dividend yield is above 3% or 4%, while a mild dividend yield is between 1% and 2%. The price-to-book ratio is calculated by dividing the stock price by the book value per share and is used to determine the market valuation of a company. A ratio under one is considered good, while over one may indicate an overvalued stock. Other important metrics discussed include profit margin, return on equity, and current ratio. The discussion concludes with an example of Apple stock and how to apply these metrics in practice."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giGcuofIYis_sep_2416_2758,giGcuofIYis_sep_2416_2758,"Very high, very good. You have your income statement stuff if you want to look into that. You have your balance sheet. You can see that they have total cash of $76.83 billion and the current ratio, which we did talk about, is 1.16. Just above one, so that is a good sign, but it's not too high, meaning that they have just about 16% higher current assets as they have current liabilities. Something I always like doing is coming back to the summary page and coming down here to the financials, to the analyst ratings, as well as the analyst price targets. You can see that for Apple, these are the financials for the last few years. Here we can see the analyst recommendations. Right now they're rating it as a two based on all the different analysts that they have in the system, meaning there's a buy according to these analysts. You also have the price target. Right now the average analyst price target is $152.06, which is higher than the current price of $123.25. Analysts aren't always correct. It's just good to see what other people are thinking. It's something I always look at when analyzing stocks. Let's talk about timing the market and the question, should you do it or should you not? Basically, I'm going to define timing the market as trying to predict the stock market, aka predicting any gains, predicting any crashes, and using those predictions to influence your buying or selling pattern. Now I will say that historically it has been better to buy after a crash than to try and time a market high. Based on past historical data, it's been seen that stocks tend to recover. This is true for any good company that survives a crash or an economic downturn. If there is a large crash, then that could be a good time to buy. I will say this, don't sell during any of these small crashes because that is called panic selling. That means you are going to be losing a lot of money that you don't have to lose. If you focus on the long term and hold as long as you can, this puts you in the most strong position for making money through investing. It's just overall a lot safer. My safe answer is if you time the market, it's going to be bad. Rather, you want to spend more time in the market. Just elaborate on this, you guys. It's super hard to time the market because you need to be right two different times. You need to guess the top of the market to sell and you need to guess the bottom of the market to actually reinvest your money. Doing both of these is extremely hard. That's why I say if the market crashes and it's a good company, that could be a good time to buy. That's a lot easier to predict than trying to time both the high points as well as the low points. If you look at the past historical data, you actually see that most gains are from these rally days. There are a few really high performing days each year where the share prices go up a lot. It's very easy to miss those days. Dollar cost averaging. This is basically a technique of investing over time. It's basically where you're gradually investing into a company over time instead of investing all your money at once. This is a great tool for new investors who want to limit their risk exposure if a crash does occur. You're not putting all your money into the market or into that company at one time. Rather, you're going to put it in slowly. That way, if somehow the market does crash, then the price is going to be a lot lower. You're going to have a lot more buying power and it's going to mitigate any risk of buying all at a higher price and seeing the market crash. Historically, since the market generally moves up, it should technically be better to buy all at once. In volatile markets, dollar cost averaging can be a great strategy. Right now, there is a lot of volatility. That's why I always recommend dollar cost averaging as a good technique. Now, let's talk about appreciation versus dividends. These are two ways for you to make money through investing. It really is like comparing apples to oranges. The first way you make money through stocks is through appreciation. This is what happens when you see a rise in the share price just due to the company performance and the market sentiment. When a stock appreciates, let's say you buy at $10, it appreciates to $12. That's when you see that $2 gain. If you sell it at that $12, then you see that capital gain through appreciation. Appreciation is not guaranteed. It could go either up or it can go down. If it does go up, that is when you do make money through appreciation. You can also make money through dividends. These are paid out quarterly usually, and it's a more recurring income. This happens when companies are paying out a portion of their profits to their investors. They're basically rewarding you by paying you out a little dividend. What you can do with this dividend is you can actually reinvest it. Use that dividend money to actually buy more shares, or you can pull it out and just use it for your daily life expenses. You might be wondering, how come I can't just buy a stock right before the ex-dividend date, right before that dividend is actually paid out, and then sell that stock right after when I come out ahead? The problem with this is that the stock price actually normally drops exactly by the dividend amount right after. It's basically a wash. You don't really come out ahead. The great thing is that a lot of stocks, they will appreciate in value and they will also pay out dividends. This is great because you can make money in both ways, but I will say that for companies that pay out dividends. Usually their appreciation is a little bit slower, and that's because instead of reinvesting all that money back to the company, they're paying out some of those profits to investors. Usually their growth is a little bit slower. One pro about investing in stocks with no dividend is that you don't get taxed until you sell. Appreciation is not taxed until you actually sell that stock. However, on the other hand with dividends, if you do get paid out a dividend, no matter if you reinvest that money or you just take it out for your life expenses, this is considered a taxable event and you will need to pay taxes each year for those dividends. Also, if you have companies that pay out super high dividends, this usually means that they're","The discussion covers some basics of finance and investing. It starts with a brief overview of Apple's financials and analyst recommendations. The next topic discussed is timing the market, which is defined as trying to predict the stock market to influence buying or selling patterns. Historically, it has been seen that stocks tend to recover after a crash, so buying during a downturn may be a good idea. The discussion then moves on to dollar-cost averaging, a technique where an investor gradually invests over time instead of all at once, which can be useful in volatile markets. The last topic discussed is appreciation versus dividends. Appreciation refers to a rise in share price, while dividends are paid out by companies to their investors as a portion of their profits. Both are ways to make money through investing, but appreciation is not guaranteed, while dividends can provide recurring income. It is also noted that buying stocks just before the ex-dividend date and selling them right after is not profitable, as the stock price typically drops by the dividend amount."

And yeah, I've seen that normally these high-dividend companies are usually in the telecommunications sectors. So let's also talk about the tax implications of investing. What actually happens when you sell a stock? So when you sell a stock or any capital asset, you will get taxed if you sell it for more than you actually paid for, right? That constitutes a capital gain. So when you are determining whether or not you wanna sell a stock, you really should consider the tax implications. You will owe some taxes if you made money on it. There are two types of capital gains that you need to be aware of. There's long-term capital gains and there's short-term capital gains. Now with long-term capital gains, this occurs when you sell a stock that you hold for one year or longer. So let's say I buy a stock today and then I wait over one year to sell it. That is gonna be a long-term capital gain and you're actually probably gonna be taxed lower on that than if you hold it for under one year. The long-term capital gains rates are 0%, 15%, and 20% and it depends on your income level. Now with short-term capital gains, this occurs when you're selling before one year and this is taxed as ordinary income. So for a lot of high-earning people out there where your income taxes are super high, then that means that holding your stock for 364 days versus holding your stock for let's say 366 days could create huge implications in how much you're paying in taxes. So yeah, like I said, in general, holding for over one year is going to result in less taxes when you do sell and your brokerage will send you a tax document each year with your capital gains or losses. This applies to taxable accounts, you guys. When you're talking about retirement accounts, it's a bit different, it's a lot more complex, but the main point is know that there are taxes when you do sell for a profit. Let's go into a little bit more detail about long-term capital gains. I think this is extremely important and just really shows you why it's important to hold for over one year. So in 2021, the capital gains tax rate thresholds are as follows. It's 0% if you make up to $40,400 as a single filer. It's 15% if you make between $40,401 to $445,850. And if you make over $455,850, then it's 20%. I will say that there is a possible 3.8% additional tax on top of this for net investment income for really high earners. And that's gonna include earnings like taxable interest, dividends, gains, passive rents, annuities, and royalties. But if you're not single and you're married or you're the head of a household, you can check out the rates for the other income levels. Now for short-term capital gains, these are the tax brackets for single filers in 2021. It is a progressive tax system. So let's say your taxable income is between $0 and $9,950. That means that your marginal tax rate is gonna be 10%. This goes all the way up to 37% after you make over $523,600. So you can see if you're a high earner and your marginal tax rate, your tax bracket is very high, and then selling stocks that you've held for under a year is going to massively increase the amount of taxes you're paying versus if you could just pay those long-term capital gains instead. And this actually does not include state taxes, so that's in addition to this. So yeah, you can see that there's huge savings. Now in this section, we're gonna be talking about retirement accounts, and these are so important. These allow you to save so much money on taxes, and most importantly, they allow you to save money and be prepared for retirement. Everyone in their right mind should take advantage of tax-advantaged retirement accounts. So let's talk about the Roth IRA. This is an account that pretty much everyone should start off with, especially if you're not making that much money right now and you expect to be making more money later on. So yeah, I highly consider looking at the Roth IRA if you are eligible. Basically, with this account, you are paying taxes now and you're avoiding taxes on any future gains. So when you are in retirement, when you're at least 59 and a half years old, this account allows you to pull out gains without paying those taxes. And if you compare this to a normal taxable account, you can see that you're paying half the amount of taxes because you're not being taxed twice. Now for most people, you're gonna be able to contribute up to $6,000 per year. There are other retirement accounts that you can research yourself, but I highly, highly recommend looking at taking advantage of these tax-advantaged retirement accounts. Now let's talk about tax loss harvesting. This is a strategy that you can use to offset any capital gains that you make. So with tax loss harvesting, the whole definition is you're basically selling shares at a loss to offset a capital gains tax liability. And usually this is done at the end of the year. So let's say you made a bunch of money selling your shares of a company that did really well for the year, right? You made a lot of money with that. What you can do is you can sell some stocks that you actually lost money on, create a loss, and then use that loss to offset any gains in that year. Then after selling for a loss, you can actually replace them with a similar asset. But I will say that there is this wash sale rule. And it says that you cannot repurchase a stock for 30 days if you claim the loss for tax purposes. So let's go through an example of tax loss harvesting. Let's say you've had stock A for 67 days and you want to sell it. Your total gains so far are $100,000. You've made a gain of $100,000 on the stock. This results in $100,000 of short-term capital gains because you sold within 67 days and not over one year, over one year, over one year, over one year, over one year, over one year, over one year.","The discussion covers several topics related to finance, including high-dividend companies in the telecommunications sector, tax implications of investing, and tax-advantaged retirement accounts. It also explains the difference between long-term and short-term capital gains and their associated tax rates. Additionally, tax loss harvesting is discussed as a strategy to offset capital gains tax liabilities. Overall, the discussion emphasizes the importance of considering tax implications when investing and taking advantage of tax-advantaged retirement accounts to save money on taxes."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giGcuofIYis_sep_3076_3410,giGcuofIYis_sep_3076_3410,"tax at 37% if you're in the highest income bracket. This means that you're gonna have $37,000 in taxes, not including any applicable state taxes. On the other hand, you have had stock B for 180 days and you are thinking about selling it, right? You've actually lost $50,000 on this stock, which is not good, right? But you can actually use that $50,000 of short-term capital loss and offset that $100,000 of short-term capital gains. So if you take 100,000, subtract 50,000, this leaves you with $50,000 of net short-term capital gains and that's gonna come in at $18,500 in taxes. That definitely is a whole lot better than paying $37,000 in taxes. So that is a technique that you can use to reduce your taxable income. Now the same thing applies for long-term capital gains. I will say that it has to match so you can only offset long-term capital gains with long-term capital losses. And it really is a great strategy where you can realize tax savings when you want to sell an asset for profit. Okay, value versus momentum investing. Let's talk about Warren Buffett's principles of investing, right? First one is leaders are important. He really cares about who the CEO is, who the leadership board is, because they have a dramatic impact on the performance of that company. His second principle is he wants to invest with facts and not emotions. Stock trading can be extremely emotional and when you trade with emotions, a lot of the time you're gonna lose. So that's why Warren Buffett likes to look at the facts only and really not look at any of the emotions. He also wants to invest for the long-term and generally he's not going to sell unless the business changes fundamentally in a bad way. So like I said earlier, investing in the long-term, probably a lot safer than investing for the short-term. Another thing that Warren Buffett says is that for most people, for like 95% of people, an index fund is best. Most people are gonna make more money just investing in a traditional index fund such as VOO like we talked about earlier versus trying to pick out individual companies, trying to time the market, buying when it's low, trying to sell when it's high and all that stuff. When you buy an index fund and just hold it for a long, long time, that is how the majority of people are going to come out ahead with investing. Another thing that he really emphasizes is try and buy shares of companies that you are knowledgeable about. Don't buy shares in companies that you literally know nothing about. You don't know their business model, you don't know who's running the company and yeah, that comes down to the due diligence, right? You need to do your own due diligence before investing in any company and you really need to know that company before investing. His last principle is when you see a great opportunity, take it so when something comes up in the market where there might be a company that's undervalued or investors are for some reason just dumping stock for no good apparent reason, then that could be a good time to actually hop on that opportunity and buy shares. And we've seen this a lot in Warren Buffett's career. He'll actually hop on these opportunities as soon as he sees them. Now let's also talk about value versus momentum investing, right? You have on one hand, value investors. These people care about fundamental analysis. They care about all those metrics that we talked about like P-E ratio, price to book ratio, all that stuff. And they are specifically looking for companies that they think are undervalued compared to their intrinsic value. That's why value investors, they'll try and buy companies that are undervalued, hold long-term or until that company becomes overvalued and then they might sell off part of their portion of shares or sell off all their shares. On the other hand, you have momentum and growth investors. So these are traders that don't really care so much about all the fundamentals of the company. They don't care if a company could be overvalued in a sense, rather they are looking at the future potential of that company. So things like P-E ratio, P-B ratio, they don't matter as much. These investments, they tend to be riskier and a little bit more volatile because since they are overvalued in a sense, there is much more room for them to go up and down. And these types of investors are generally gonna prefer investing in these emerging industries. So right now it's gonna be like EV, it's gonna be tech, it's gonna be all these sectors that while they are overvalued, they have seen a lot of high growth in the last year. You don't need to be only one of these, you guys. You can be a mix of them. And for most people, I'd recommend not being one or the other. If you're too much of a value investor, then you might be losing out on a lot of possible growth. And if you're a really big momentum slash growth investor, then you could be missing out on those really undervalued companies that will continue to grow for a long time. And you might actually buy some companies that are overvalued right now and lose money in the short term. Now let's talk about the importance of investing earlier. I think this is extremely important. And the number one phenomenon that you need to be aware of is compound growth, compound interest, right? So let's say you have an initial investment of $6,000 and then you decide to contribute $500 per month for 40 years. Given an estimated interest rate of about 7%, which is what we've seen historically, you can see that the growth of that money shoots up so much compared to if you just put that money in a cash account or a savings account or something like that. So based on this graph right here, the results are in, in 40 years, you will have $1,287,657.42. Compare that to, let's say, if you put that money in just a cash account, you'd probably have what, about $246,000. And all that vertical growth is happening in the later years. And what we wanna do is we wanna shift that vertical growth as early as possible. And that's what investing early does. So let's take a look at the impact of when you start investing. I found this from US News. And I thought it was extremely, extremely eye-opened, extremely eye-opened, extremely eye-opened, extremely eye-opened, extremely eye-opened,","The discussion covers several topics related to finance and investing. The first topic is tax optimization, where it is explained that capital gains can be offset by capital losses. This means that if an investor has short-term capital gains of $100,000 and short-term capital losses of $50,000, they can use the loss to reduce their taxable income, resulting in a tax saving. The second topic is the principles of investing according to Warren Buffett, which include investing for the long-term, investing with facts rather than emotions, investing in index funds, conducting due diligence, and seizing opportunities. The third topic is the difference between value and momentum investing, where the former involves buying undervalued companies, while the latter focuses on companies with high growth potential, regardless of whether they are overvalued. Lastly, the discussion emphasizes the importance of investing early, given the benefits of compound growth and compound interest."

Then you have Jill who invests $200 per month starting at age 35, so 10 years after Jack. She contributes a total of $72,000. Then you have Joey who invests $200 per month starting at age 45, so a whole 20 years after Jack. He contributes a total of $48,000. If you look at the growth from when they start investing to the age of 65, you can see how drastically different their portfolio values are. Jack only invested $96,000, right? But now his portfolio is valued at over $500,000. Whereas Joey on the other side of the spectrum, he invests $48,000, so half of Jack, but he only has a portfolio value of $100,000. You can see just how different that is. And that just really shows you how important it is to start investing early. No matter what age you are, if you haven't started investing, that's why I recommend doing that right now, because you want to shift that graph as far left as possible, and you want to take advantage of as much of that vertical growth as possible. So now how much money should you guys invest? And these are just my opinions. It really depends on your whole situation. But I'd say that you want to invest the money that you don't need to live. That's why raising your income, you guys, is so important. And that's why the rich get richer, right? They have their set base expenses for their life, and then they have all this extra money that they are going to invest into the markets, into real estate, into other investments. However, you don't want to invest in your money that you actually need to live, because of course, we need to live. So if you're young and you have some excess cash, what I recommend doing is open up an account after watching this video, and then just start investing to get the ball rolling. You don't need to put in that much money, $5, $10, $100, $1,000, doesn't really matter. The whole point with this is you want to just get over that hump of investing and start investing as early as you can. This is going to increase your chances of putting more money in the future months and just building up that big portfolio that you want to retire off of. However, I will say that if you're young, there are probably some better things that you can invest in that are going to have a much higher ROI. So these are things like your self-improvement, building a business, and spending money on your education. These things can pay off way higher than investing in stocks. But yeah, it really depends on what your goals are in life and where you currently are at. So whatever you're doing, I'd say set a monthly goal of how much money to invest based on your income. Only you know what's best for you. So look through your finances, think how much extra money do I have each month, and then invest a significant portion of that. If it were me and I were starting out, I would prioritize index funds. These are the things that you can buy, just set on the side and not really worry about. I would much rather invest my time and effort into building up my self-improvement, building businesses and generating more income. And of course, something I've been talking about for a long time is due diligence. Anytime you're investing in a stock, you absolutely need to do your own research. So the Securities Act of 1933 made it so that brokerages have to disclose specific information about securities before they can be sold to the public. This is like the first level of due diligence. It's from the brokerage, and it means that there are probably not going to be any phony companies out there in the stock market for you to buy. And then the second level of due diligence comes from your own research as a retail investor. So this can be doing your fundamental analysis, evaluating the core attributes of that company and their assets, performance, financials, all that stuff. It can also be a technical analysis. So you're looking at patterns and trends, finding things that other people aren't seeing. I know I didn't really talk about this, like diving into these charts and graphs, but that's also another way that you can actually do your own due diligence. And yeah, when you have those multiple levels of due diligence, that's when you can make investing a lot more safer. It's not 100% safe as with any type of investing, but you want to be as safe as you can. So my golden rule is I like to try and invest one hour minimum for any company that I do want to invest in. If you want to buy individual companies, it's really important that you know what that company does. You know their financials, you know their leadership, you know their whole game plan, and you're comfortable with that. If you want to invest in index funds or through robo-advisor, that's when you don't need to do too much research, and it's a lot easier, I'd say. Different stocks are going to work for different people, right? What works for you might not work for someone else. And it really comes down.","The discussion highlights the importance of starting investing early to take advantage of compound interest. Jack, Jill, and Joey invest $200 per month, but Jack started at 25, Jill at 35, and Joey at 45. Jack's portfolio is now valued at over $500,000, while Joey's is only $100,000. It is recommended to invest money that is not needed to live, and the amount to invest depends on individual situations. Prioritizing self-improvement, building a business, and education may pay off better than investing in stocks for young people. Due diligence is crucial before investing, and it involves researching fundamental and technical analysis to make investing safer. Different stocks work for different people, depending on their goals and financial situations."

You cannot save your way to wealth. You have to. I think you got to have a dream. The school of greatness. Really? Yeah. Please welcome, Lewis Howes. So someone wants to become financially free to be able to retire within 15 years. Yeah. I want to talk about that. Sure. I want to talk about it at different stages of life. If you're in your 20s to your 30s, if you're in your 30s to your 40s, I want to talk about that. What would be like a step by step approach from first the mindset standpoint, which is your thing. Yeah. Thinking of the mindset. Okay, I want to retire in 15 years. How do I have to think to then the actual actions that people need to take in order to get there? And what does retirement actually look like? That's a good question. So let me, I'm going to give you a quick formula and then I'm going to break it down because I have created, it's not very complex, but I created this wealth formula which breaks it down into a very simple, almost mathematical thing where it's you take your income, you subtract your expenses and that equals your investments plus your savings. Income. Plus, income minus expenses equals your investments plus your savings. So if you want to become wealthy, it ultimately comes down to having more investments. Your savings are not there to make you wealthy. They're there to protect you against an emergency. Your investments are what make you wealthy. So if you want to become wealthy sooner or if you want to become a wealthier. You need more investments. You need more investments. How do you do that? Well, if it's your income minus your expenses, it's basic math. Either increase your income, decrease your expenses or do both. So that's the ultimate formula. So now if we talk about, let's break it down step by step on how do you actually do it. Six steps. And this is no matter what age you are, these are the six steps that you want to follow. Before you get into the six steps, what is the mindset that someone needs to think about? Step number one is build the mindset. Oh, my man. So step number one is you need to have the right mindset. And so this is why I call myself the minority mindset and the brand minority mindset because it's all about thinking differently than the majority of people because if you follow what the majority of people do in 80 to 90% of situations, you're probably doing something wrong. And you'll be in debt and you'll be paying off debts and loans for the rest of your life. The majority of people are broke. The majority of people are living paycheck to paycheck. The majority of people are drowning in debt. The majority of people have zero to no investments. The majority of people are unhappy. The majority of people are miserable and the majority of people do not like their jobs. This is not me exaggerating. These are all statistical numbers where more than 50% of people feel this way. And so if now you keep doing what everybody else does, you're going to end up like everybody else. And so this is where now you want to think a little bit different and try to find what's right for you and try to get educated yourself because when it comes to the mindset, the first thing you have to understand is that it is possible because if you're sitting there saying it's not possible for someone like me, somebody who has my background, my parents, my whatever, I can't become successful. I 100% guarantee that you will not be able to become successful. You cannot change your outcome without changing your mindset. And in the previous interview we had, we talked about mindset versus toolset where most of the times we assume that the reason why we can't become successful is because we lack the toolset when in reality for 90% of people it's lacking the right mindset because when you have the right mindset, you'll discover that the toolset is right around you. So it's first believing that you can do it because once you know and believe that you can do it, that belief is going to then impact your decisions because now you can say, you know what? Yeah, maybe I can become successful. What are you going to do? You're going to go on to YouTube, watch videos. How do I become successful? Then you start watching videos, maybe start bingeing videos and now you start to realize, oh, okay, I can start to do this. I can change this about my life. I need to change the way I think. I need to change my actions. I need to do more things in my day. I need to stop watching so much Netflix. I need to do this. Then maybe start reading books and I start reading business books because I have read a lot of business books and there's so much wealth in a $20 business. Just go on to Audible, look at some of the top business books and just start reading them and you will learn so much. Now you start reading them. Maybe you start doing a little bit. Maybe you don't succeed too much, but you start taking some action and you start to learn even more because your experiences are some of the best teachers in the world. Even if you make mistakes. I have learned from my mistakes. I didn't have a mentor. I didn't have guidance. I didn't have investment family members. I didn't have people telling me how entrepreneurship works. I screwed up a ton just like you. We made a ton of mistakes and that's how we learned. And then maybe you go and take a class. Now you're like, okay, I want to learn how to do this. I'm trying to build this business. I'm doing something wrong. I'm trying to get a better job or I'm trying to get a raise. I keep doing something wrong. You read books. Now maybe you find a class. You invest some money in this class and now you have more education. Now you try more and now you start to see over time. Oh my God, 12 months ago, I had no idea.","The discussion is about how to become wealthy and retire in 15 years. The guest, Lewis Howes, introduces a simple wealth formula that involves increasing income, decreasing expenses, and investing. The conversation breaks down into six steps to achieve financial freedom at any age. The first step is building the right mindset, which involves thinking differently than the majority of people and believing that it is possible to become successful. It is also recommended to educate oneself through videos, books, and taking action, even if mistakes are made. The key is to think differently, take action, and invest more to become wealthy."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQXrWhcomdY_sep_306_655,fQXrWhcomdY_sep_306_655,"Now that I believe that I can do it, I started watching YouTube videos, I started reading books, I started taking classes, I started taking action. And then you keep doing it. Maybe you hire a coach, maybe you hire a consultant. The list goes on and on and on, what you can do. But it all first starts with the mindset because if you tell yourself you can't, your mind shuts down and you're never going to find an opportunity. You're never going to look for the opportunity. So that's where the mindset is the most important thing. And if you don't have the right mindset, this is where the first thing you want to do is start learning how to build self-esteem, how to build my confidence, how do I believe in myself? And there's, I don't have a ton of videos on this. I know you have a ton of videos on this. Watch Lewis's stuff, right? So start there. Then we go a little bit deeper now for focusing on finances. The mindset is number one. Mindset is number one. The second thing now, once you build the right mindset is you want to create your financial base. The best way to understand this is just to think if you wanted to build a house, what do you do first? Well, you got to foundation. You got to build the foundation. If you want to build a bigger house, you want to dig a deeper foundation. You want to build a tall building, you need an even deeper foundation. So you have to start by building your financial base. And what that means financially is first, you want to save $2,000. At the very least, you want to put aside some cash for savings as fast as possible because right now, it's something like 40 to 70% of Americans don't have, well, 40% of Americans don't have $1,000 to put aside and something close to 70% of Americans don't even have $400 to put aside to protect them against an emergency. So most Americans don't have $1,000 to put aside. Get a $2,000 base. So have a two-grade as fast as possible. And then you need to cut the financial bleeding. That means your high interest debts, your credit card debts, your hard money loans, your 0% APR loans, which are now charged you 20 to 25%. These need to be paid off as fast as possible because these are loans that are skinning you alive financially. So, I mean, it seems like credit cards are one of the biggest things that hold people back. Look, credit cards are a tool. They are a tool. If you're not educated with them, you can get stuck. If you have this tool without the education, it will burn you. I only spend with a credit card. I spend a lot of money with a credit card because I know how to use a tool. And now because I know how to use my credit card, what happens? Well, I don't spend more than I would otherwise because I use my credit card just as a medium of exchange. I'm going to spend this money anyways. Might as well use my credit card. And get the benefits. When my credit card gives me, it gives me perks. It gives me cash back. It gives me fraud protection. It gives me free insurance. It gives me hotel upgrades. It gives me all these things just because I use my credit card instead of paying with cash. And so now again, it's the financial education because now some people will say, oh my God, these credit card companies are scams. Well, the reason why they're looked at as scams is because we don't have the right education on how to use them. It's a tool without the education on how to use it. And this is where now you have to build that financial education and many times you're going to have to go out and do it yourself because your credit card company is not incentivized to give you the financial education because they're going to make less money. Right. It's profitable to keep people poor. It's profitable to keep people financially uneducated because now if you just keep spending money in your credit card because you have no idea what you're doing, now your credit card company is going to get rich. The average household in America has $6,200 with the credit card debt. So if you have credit card debt in America, you probably have an average of $6,200. Now let's talk about that because if... What's the interest on that? It's going up less at 15 to 25, 28%. And that's going up. So every month you're paying that. You're paying it every month. So it's not $6,000 a month. It's really over years if you never fully pay it off, you're just paying more and more and more. And the interest rate on your credit card isn't fixed rate, it's variable interest rate. So as the Federal Reserve Bank raises interest rates, the interest rate on your credit card also goes up. So if you are 21 years old right now and you invested $6,200, which is the average household credit card debt right now, if you invest $6,200 right now and you got a 20% return on your money and you did that for the next 45, 46 years, you are going to retire with $20 million. $20 million. And you never invest another penny again. Say it more time. If you invest $6,200 today and you never invest another penny again... At 21. At 21 and you get a 20% return on your money, you're going to retire with 20 million. Wow. It does bleed. Where in the world am I going to get a 20% return on my money year after year? You're right. But your credit card company is doing it every single day. Wow. They're charging you. And so when you have that sort of credit card debt, that's you making your credit card company richer. Now, you know, whether or not you think it's a scam, look, let's move past and understand what's going on. That way now you can use it to your advantage. Because I get tens of thousands of dollars worth of cash back every year from my credit because I use it as a tool and I understand how to use it. And this is where, look, if you don't want to use a credit card, it doesn't matter. But just don't, if you have credit card debt, you have to pay that off because that is skinning you alive right now. Understand the financial education aspect. So that's the first thing you want to do is create your financial base. So you got to save some cash and you got to pay that credit card debt off. Cut the financial bleeding. Cut the financial bleeding. What's the strategy if you got three credit cards? What's the strategy to get rid of that debt? So Dave Ramsey is going to tell you to do something called the snowball method. The smallest first, smallest first, and then to the biggest. You're building momentum, right? A financial advisor might tell you the opposite. Do the debt avalanche, which is now pay the highest interest rate first and then go down because now you're going to pay off the mobile.","The discussion centers around how to build a solid financial foundation. The first step is to develop the right mindset. After that, you need to build your financial base by saving at least $2,000 and cutting out high-interest debt. Credit cards are a tool that can be beneficial if used correctly. However, most people are not educated on how to use them and end up accumulating significant debt. It's important to get financial education to use credit cards wisely and prevent financial ruin. Finally, the discussion points out that by investing $6,200 today with a 20% return, someone can retire with $20 million after 45 years without investing another penny."

The reason why Dave Ramsey recommends the snowball method is because psychologically, when you get those small wins of paying something off, you feel like you're winning and you can pay it off faster. A advisor is gonna look at the math and say, hey, look, these numbers are telling me that pay off the higher interest rate first because it's gonna save you the most money of the long term. Which one's right? Again, I'm not gonna say which one. Do what's best for you. Because I know if I was in a situation, I'm not. I like the idea of paying down the heavy interest rate first because that's how my brain works. I don't need the small wins like that. I can work for the long term. I think the entrepreneurial mindset where I know how my mind works so I understand myself. And this is just honestly being open and honest with yourself. If you can't stay true with it, then do the snowball. It does not matter. Screw paying it off a few months early. Just get it away and pay it off as fast as possible. Cut the financial bleeding and have a $2,000 base. That's step two. Okay. That's step two. Now the next thing you wanna do is what I call lead your money. So this is where you wanna create a financial system and start investing your money because your savings will never make you wealthy. You cannot save your way to wealth. You have to invest your money. Your savings won't make you wealthy because of what we've talked about in previous interviews, inflation. You're losing money in the savings. If inflation is higher than the interest rate that you're getting at the bank, then your savings are effectively making you poorer each and every day because your savings are losing value to inflation. Now does this mean you should not save any money? No. It means you need to save your money strategically. So you wanna save your money for three reasons and three reasons only. Save your money for an emergency. Save your money for a big purchase. If you wanna buy a car, you wanna buy a house, you wanna buy a nice watch, whatever you wanna buy, you need cash in order to do that. And then three, save your money for an investment. If you're not saving your money for one of these three reasons, you're saving your money the wrong way and it is making you poorer by saving that money. So now we're focusing on the first aspect of saving your money for an emergency. How much do you save? This is now again, going to depend on your risk tolerance. You wanna save somewhere between three to 12 months worth of your expenses. And the amount of money you save is gonna depend on where you are in life and how much risk you're willing to take on. If you're like, hey dude, I'm 25 years old, I don't have any financial responsibilities, I don't need that much savings, fine. Save a few months worth of savings and that's it. Invest more aggressively. If you're like, hey, I have a family, I have kids, I have a spouse, I don't wanna take on all this risk, then save six months, nine months, a year's worth of savings because now it will give you that peace of mind that you have some extra cash put aside. So it's gonna depend on your risk tolerance and what you want. But this, in this lead your money step, this is where you wanna understand that there's more to putting your money aside than just saving your money. You also wanna be putting your money to work. And the best way to do this is to create a system where no matter how much money you're making, you are going to proportionately, continually invest and save based on your income. So what does that mean? Well, one of the simplest things you can do is follow something like- Percentage. My 75, 15, 10 plan. Which means for every dollar that you earn, 75 cents is the maximum that you can spend. 15 cents is the minimum that you invest and 10 cents is the minimum that you save. And this never changes with your income. The only thing that you would ever change is after you hit that savings goal for your emergency savings, you don't keep saving your money for the emergency because you built that whatever once you want, you put that towards your investments. And now whether you're making 40 grand, 400 grand, four million, 40 million, you just keep following the same thing and you're living below your means and now you're constantly putting money aside for your investments. Now again, we talked about this before. This investment money can either be passively invested, all of it, or you can put this money aside to be invested. So you can put this money into a bank account, you're looking for a rental property, you're looking for a business to buy, you're looking for a cheap stock to buy. This now depends on your investment goals. Where do you want to be invested? How do you want to invest your money? And this is that financial education now of, what do you want to do? And your personal goals. If you don't want to be involved with your money, you don't want to be, hey, day to day investing or paying attention to the markets, you hate that idea, just passively invest it. Put it into low cost ETFs, index funds, and don't even worry about it and let it do its thing. You don't change it whether the market's up or down. So this is where now you're putting your money to work.","The discussion covers personal finance and the importance of paying off debt, creating a financial system, and investing money. There is a debate on whether to pay off debt with the highest interest rate first or the snowball method that focuses on paying off small debts first to build momentum. The importance of creating an emergency fund and strategically saving for big purchases and investments is also discussed. A suggested financial system is the 75-15-10 plan, where 75% of income is spent, 15% is invested, and 10% is saved. The discussion emphasizes that personal goals and risk tolerance should be considered when making financial decisions."

Gucci is making money, Louis Vuitton is making money, Chipotle is making money, Beamers, BMW is making money, but you're the one that's making all them rich. That's if you say, I want to become wealthy, but you have no savings and yet you have all this nice stuff, you look rich, but the stuff that's looking rich is making you broke. Making you broke, yeah. So you're paying the price to look rich, but there's nothing wrong with that, but you just have to understand what your goals are. If you say, hey, I don't really care about building wealth, I just want to have my stuff, it's a free country, it's your choice. But if you say, I want to have wealth, you have no investments and you're spending money on all this stuff, this is where you want to rethink what you're doing and understand what it is that you want and make sure that your actions are aligning with your goals, your life cell is aligning with what you want to do. I mean, you can't keep lying to yourself. That's why you should put your money not in buying the bag, but in buying the stock every month. Exactly, exactly. Own the company, own the places where you're spending your money. And again, there's nothing wrong with having nice stuff. What I'm trying to say is just be able to afford it. Yeah. You know what? Don't go into a credit card with it. Yeah. Don't go into a credit card with it. If you want a nice watch, you want a nice house, you want a nice car, fine. Just make sure you can afford it first. Right. And this brings me now to the next step, which I call interest free living. And now this is where we're going to go a little bit deeper of how do you actually spend your money? Because in the American culture, it is very normal to be in debt. It's very normal to buy things that you can't afford. And before it was with credit cards. Now it's with this new thing called buy now, pay later. I'm an entrepreneur. I'm very much involved in the financial space. I'm very much involved in the fintech space. Buy now, pay later over the last couple of years is arguably the fastest growing sector in fintech. They're crushing it, right? They're crushing it. I have not invested any money into buy now, pay later apps because I don't believe in it. However, it's putting more people in the debt kind of the way that they work is you can buy something now and worry about the price later. Now, the pitch to consumers, to people is, well, you don't have to pay any interest. Kind of like the housing market back in the day. Right? It rhymes. It rhymes. History rhymes, right? But the whole idea that they say is you don't got to pay any interest, just pay it off for say 12 months or six months, which doesn't seem like a bad idea. Why would I want to pay $1,000 for a laptop today if I could just pay it off in installments and not pay any interest for the next 12 months? Well, if that's the case, why is it such a fast growing industry? I mean, no one's going to invest billions of dollars into something if they're not going to see any sort of financial return. I mean, they've got to, the most expensive kind of money is free money. So if they're giving you money for free, how are they going to make money from it? Well, let's take a little bit deeper. If you don't get past your, if you don't pay in your 12 months, then what? So that's the first part. If you don't pay it off, now you get slapped with a very, very hefty fine, a very, very hefty fee where now you're paying a massive interest rate, essentially like a credit card. They're just acting like a credit card. It's the same concept where you get a little bit of a grace period. But the second aspect is if you want to buy a laptop for $1,000 and you need $1,000 to buy it, well, you got to have $1,000. But if you don't have to pay for it now, you can buy a laptop. Pay $100 a month. Yeah. You still have the $1,000 in your bank account, maybe $900. And now what happens? I can go buy more stuff for $100 a month. That's $1,000. And more and more. So it allows people to spend even more to lock in all the stuff. So you have a whole bunch of stuff and all your money is going out to pay for the stuff that you bought yesterday. A year ago now. A year ago. And then if you can't pay it off in time, because that's ultimately their goal. If you can't pay it off in time, now you get slapped with all that interest, all these fees, and now you're the one that's got to pay it off. So this is where you have to understand the spending aspect of how do you spend your money? Because again, these things are tools. I wonder how many people, this is going into our previous interview, I wonder how many people signed up for more credit cards since 2020 and also signed up for more, bought more things with this buy now pay later. I wonder if there's data out there on this. I don't know. Which will give us a more indication, hey, 12 to 24 months from now, man, people need to either make double the money or they're going to be going into a lot more debt. So in terms of the number of credit cards, I don't have an answer off the top of my head. But what I do know is the amount of money spent on the credit cards. Because in 2020, when the pandemic hit, we saw the fastest pay down of credit card debt ever, which was great.","The discussion revolves around the importance of not spending all of one's money on material goods, and instead investing in stocks and other financial instruments to build wealth. The speakers caution against the use of credit cards and buy-now-pay-later schemes as they can lead to debt and financial trouble. The speakers advise individuals to be mindful of their financial goals and make sure their actions align with them. The buy-now-pay-later industry is criticized for putting more people into debt, and the speakers caution against it. Lastly, the discussion stresses the importance of spending money wisely and avoiding debt to achieve financial freedom."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQXrWhcomdY_sep_1248_1520,fQXrWhcomdY_sep_1248_1520,"rent, you don't got to pay your student loans, you're not going out to eat, you're not going out, right? So you have very little expenses and then many people are now getting unemployment checks, you're getting stimulus checks, you have more money coming in. And many people actually became wealthier because of this situation. So you had extra cash, some people spent it, some people invested it, some people paid down their debt. And we saw the biggest credit card debt pay down in the history of time in 2020, which was- It was all from free money though. Well, at the end of the day, at least you're using it for the right purpose. So that was great. People paid down their debt. Well, then what happened towards the end of 2021 into 2022 was the economy opened back up, people started spending, you wanted to go out and you know, this pent up demand, you want to start traveling, you want to eat out again, you want to have fun again, fine. But then we were also hit with inflation. Everything is so expensive. Now you've been waiting to travel, you've been waiting to eat out, you've been waiting to do all this stuff- And it costs more. And it's so much more expensive. So now what do you do? Well, I don't got any credit card debt. I'm a credit card. And so over the last number of months, we have seen the fastest growth of credit card debt in the history of time. And this is the situation where we paid it off. And now we're going right back into it. Maybe because you feel like, hey, I got room to spend. And second, because everything is so expensive. I can't afford groceries. I can't afford gas. And so it's this whole vicious cycle- It all goes back to point number one, mindset. The mindset, the education. It is so, so, so crucial. And this is where now in this step, you can make that decision. First you have to understand how to spend your money. And then you can understand now, what do you do with the rest? Do you want to pay down your mortgage? Right. You want to pay off something like that? Or do you want to invest your money? And this is really an individualized question because the simple math is if your mortgage 5% a year and you can get an 8% return on your investment, you can invest your money, get a better return, pay off your mortgage and have some money in your pocket. It's a no-brainer. So if you can invest your money, get a better return, why would you not do that? Well, because investing comes with risk versus paying off your mortgage does not. Because when you pay off your mortgage, you get a guaranteed 5% return on your money. Because now if you pay it off a year early, you get a guaranteed 5% return versus when you invest your money, it comes with risk. Might go up, might go down. Might go up, might go down. And so now the question again is what type of life do you want to live? Do you want to say, you know what, I just don't want to have to worry about my mortgage payment. I just want to be financially free, never have to stress about money and just be okay. Then pay down the mortgage. Because now once you pay down the mortgage, your biggest expense is gone. You own your house free and clear. You still got to pay your property taxes, but at least now the biggest expense is gone and you're going to breathe so much easier when you don't have a mortgage to pay. But if you say, you know what, Jaspreet, I want to live big. I want to have the nice stuff. I want to have the big things. I want to be flashy. Nothing wrong with that. Like you, I want to have it all. Okay, that's fine. Then you don't want to be trying to get a 5% return. You want to invest this money in the markets. You want to invest it in your business. You want to invest this in your education. You want to invest this in yourself because now you can get a much better return. Is it riskier? Absolutely. But your mindset is somewhere else, right? You want to get a different type of return and this is why you're investing into the things that can give you a better return because that's what you want. But you just have to understand that it comes with risk. And if you're not comfortable with that, then do it the first. So this is where you just have to understand you and understand what type of life you want to live. But the key here is you don't want to put yourself back into the situation that got you here in the first place, where if you have the credit card debt, you got to know how to spend your money that we don't end up there again. One of the simplest things to do is now to understand the difference between being able to buy something and being able to afford something. And one of the things that I like to say is just follow the rule of five. If you can't buy five of them, you can't afford one of them. The houses are expensive though. Well, houses are an exception. They're different. We're talking about more liabilities. You want to buy a Gucci belt. You want to buy a $200 Gucci belt. Fine. Can't buy five, don't buy one. The house is different. The house is an exception. No one will give me a bite and I'll be like... Oh the house is the one exception here, where when it comes to your liabilities, that's the only liability that I would say is okay to finance. Because everything else... your Gucci belts, your clothes, your vacations, you should not be financing that. Because it's not putting any money in your pocket. And that's a clear lie, clear lie, clear lie, clear lie...","The discussion covers personal finance and the mindset required to manage it effectively. The COVID-19 pandemic brought a unique situation where people had fewer expenses and more money coming in through stimulus and unemployment checks. Many people became wealthier due to this situation, which allowed them to pay off their debt and invest the extra cash. However, towards the end of 2021 and early 2022, inflation hit, and people started spending more on traveling, eating out, and other activities. This caused credit card debt to increase at a historically high rate. Understanding how to spend money and having the right mindset is crucial in managing personal finances. You need to decide what type of life you want to live and understand whether investing in a mortgage or other opportunities is the right decision for you. The rule of five can be applied to determine whether you can afford something or not. Finally, avoiding getting back into credit card debt is essential, and you must learn to differentiate between buying something and affording something."

Plus your savings we talked about how to save your money. We talked about how to invest your money We talked about how to manage your expenses, but let's talk about the income Because if now you understand how to live below your means you understand how to put your money to work If you want to put fuel on the fire, you just got to earn more money Now if you earn a hundred thousand dollars, you earn a million dollars you earn whatever you earn more money Now you know how to put this money through your system through your funnel whether 75 15 10 or whatever else You know how to take this extra money, but it's work that way you have more money to invest more money to save More money to live your life But the key is you don't want to 100% increase your lifestyle to match your income You want to increase your income with your investments and get it expensive the same Ideally now you can you know marginally increase your expenses, but the key is you want to be increasing your income and your investments way more Yes, so the question is how do you do that? Well, this is where again Understand you if you are an employee. You don't want to start a business. You don't want to start a side hustle fine Nothing wrong with that. There's nothing wrong with being an employee You just have to understand you but that means now how can you earn more money? If you like your job look for ways to get a raise to get a promotion See how you get a bonus just be open with your boss say hey look I want to be able to contribute more I want to earn more money What can I do most people are gonna be very open and honest say hey I would like you to tack on this this and this do this and we will help raise your salary Yeah, maybe if you don't like your job, you're gonna get a certificate You go and do something else you need to figure out now how you can earn your increase your income Maybe you know what value can you bring to the business to bring in more money for the business or save more time or create some? System exactly so that the business can say okay cool. Let's give you more opportunities for growth Exactly. I mean if you can bring in an extra ten thousand dollars a year to the business of profit They're not gonna have a problem pay me you $5,000 or whatever it might be right and this is where you just want to be open because every business is different maybe take on a second job and You know, it's just figuring out how can you earn more money there now if you say well I want to do something outside of my job fine Well, the first thing you could do start a side hustle so much more accessible now than ever before I mean you can go on to the internet become a virtual assistant you can become a copywriter you can become a Designer you can become a video editor. I Have paid so up work. They're not paying me up work is a platform that I use to hire freelancers And I did a video on this so I looked this up in the last two years or three years I have spent more than a quarter million dollars on up work alone. Wow, I'm different individuals different individuals Just hiring people in different areas who don't work for me They work on their own schedule because now this freelancing business has grown so much And so there's a lot of opportunity there where now you can if you can present a service you can make money doing that Yeah, they might be working an extra five ten twenty hours a week on the side or they might just be full-time freelancers Yeah, yeah, and you get to set your hours for the most part You can really do something that you like that you enjoy that you're good at So there's a lot of opportunity there where now you can be a freelancer or start your own side. Also If you have a idea you want to one of my buddies his mom is really good at making cakes and she started this What is it called carrot cake business? And making a good I don't know how much maybe I think it's like 700 or a thousand dollars a month Selling carrot cakes from Instagram you mark it's on Instagram people say hey Can you make me a cake his mom makes the cake and he delivers it? You know, sure what I mean It's just the number of opportunities now, of course as an attorney. I should say there are liabilities to selling food Get insurance and all that but this is where there are so many opportunities, right? Just being a hustler Just getting yourself out there figuring it out And There's an unlimited amount of possibilities and opportunities out there now if you want to take it one step further You could try to build your own business Just side hustle can turn into your own business If you have a business idea invest in it first invest in your mind That's your education and then try to do it you want to invest as little money as possible Until you start generating revenue like again mindset versus tool set We assume that we need all these tools to start doing it. But the reality is the first thing you need is your mind Because there's a lot of alternatives on how you can do it like when I started I Started a sock company a number of years ago when I was trying to figure things out and it was a water resistant sock Yeah, and the Interesting thing was I knew nothing about socks. How do you manufacture socks? How do you make them waterproof? And so I was working with textile engineers. I was working on work action companies. I was working with a lot of different people I don't have a lot of money and they wanted and now we're talking about a real product so","The discussion is about how to increase your income and invest your money to achieve financial freedom. The concept of multiplier income is introduced, where the goal is to increase your income and investments more than your expenses. The importance of living below your means and managing your expenses is also discussed. The discussion then moves on to ways of earning more money, including asking for a raise, starting a side hustle, or becoming a freelancer. The importance of investing in your education and mindset is emphasized, and it is suggested that you invest as little money as possible when starting a business.

,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQXrWhcomdY_sep_1831_2102,fQXrWhcomdY_sep_1831_2102,"And essentially, I did not, I think my total cost to build my first round of socks was $3,500. It's not a lot of money, but relative to what if you want to manufacturer products and create a product to go through the prototype after prototype to prototype, it costs typically $100,000 plus. I did it for under four grand because I was able to talk to them. I used to talk about the potential and I worked with them to build out these special deals where, hey, work with me here and I'll work with you. That's the future. Exactly. And we were able to get it going. So it's the ability to hustle, be willing to find a way. And that's that mindset that sometimes too much money can be a disease, especially if you want to be a side hustler or a business because now you just have to spend it money. And I've been a victim of that too. I'll just give examples. Like the Minority Mindset blog, I didn't know how to build a blog and my time was so eaten up with things like market briefs, talking about building this tax business, although that's much newer, but building my companies, building my YouTube channel, doing all these other things, investing in real estate that I didn't really care about building a blog. Like I cared about it, but I didn't have the brain capacity and the time to sit here and come up with a strategy to do it. So I outsourced it. I hired some of literally the top blog managers in the world and they charged me a lot of money, like as in six figures plus, $100,000 plus to manage the blog. And they promised all this stuff. I was like, fine, do it. So $100,000 for the blog manager, at least another $100,000 on blog content over the course of 12 months. And guess what? No results. Zero. Nothing. The worst. What did I do? Too much money problem. I just said, I don't got the time. Just going to throw money at it. Hopefully that will fix the problem because if you can get the top blog manager, you can hire people to write. It's easy, right? Well, after those 12 months, the contract was over, fired them. And this is where I was like, all right, you know what? Let me figure this out because I do want to build a blog. And so we build a brand new strategy. It costs us a fraction, like a teeny tiny fraction of what we were paying before. Let's get bigger results. And our blog is growing. We're generating revenue now. I mean, it's a complete turnaround, but it's that mindset versus toolset. These are real stories, real things that I have gone through. So you need to know now, how do you multiply income and understand that you don't need thousands of dollars? My first business, I started with nothing. Essentially when I started my bed planning company, I started minority mindset with under a few hundred dollars. I mean, I was making videos off of my cell phone. You just need some hustle, some creativity, some actions, some consistency, some relationships, some communication and just making stuff happen. A hustle, man. I always say keep hustling at the end of my videos because the hustle mentality is so crucial and you can't teach that. You can't read that in books. You have to actually live it. And so this is where now if you want to really do that, you have to understand the hustle mentality before you go to work. And this brings me now to the be great aspect. The last part now. I like it. You've speaking my language. Exactly, right? Exactly. Greatness. So you've built the base. You're putting some money to work. You're leading your money. You are either paying off your home or you're understanding how to use your extra cash the right way. You're increasing income that way you can build your wealth even faster. Now it's all about being great. And there's two aspects to this. The first aspect that I want to talk about is protecting yourself because the reality is when people realize that you have money, they're going to try to take their hand, put it in your pocket and keep some for themselves. You know what I heard? To pause on you there, I remember hearing Oprah talk about this one time. Years ago, I heard her on some podcast or somewhere. She said something like as she started to rise to fame with her talk show and started to make a lot more money. What do you think happened? Everyone's reaching out with a handout, right? Oh, you got money now. Can you help me with a thousand dollars here? Can you help me with this? Well, you've made the money. Can you help me? Yeah. She said, I'm paraphrasing this, but after like, I don't know, a decade of this or something, it just felt like everyone was using her. Yeah. It was just being in a relationship with her and having an actual friendship or relationship. And she said that she decided after a period of time, she was tired of just giving, giving, giving, giving to people who had a handout. And so she said, I'm going to do it.","The discussion is about the importance of having a hustle mentality and being able to find creative solutions to problems, rather than just throwing money at them. The speaker shares examples of how he was able to start businesses with little money by leveraging relationships and negotiating special deals with manufacturers. He also shares a cautionary tale about how he spent a lot of money on a blog manager and content, but saw no results until he took a step back and developed a new strategy that cost a fraction of what he had been spending. The speaker stresses the importance of protecting oneself as one's wealth grows, as people will try to take advantage of those with money. Finally, the speaker discusses the importance of striving for greatness and being intentional with one's actions and relationships."

And just like she gave out gifts based on what she wanted to give to each person. Everyone got something. And she said, she gave a speech at the end and said, this is all I'm gonna give you, don't ask for anything else after this. And she said, still people were complaining, oh, you gave this person 10 grand, I only got 5,000. It's like, you gotta learn to protect yourself, mentally, psychologically, financially, because you could just be giving and giving and giving and it can never end. Right? 100%. So how do you do this? That's the huge relationship aspect. I'm gonna take it one step a little bit deeper on the legal side, because you're absolutely right. I struggle with that relationship side as well, because- I'm not saying don't be generous, but also it's like, when you feel like you're being taken advantage of, then it becomes challenging. So my family's from a state in India called Punjab. And what happens, a lot of people, is you come here to America, or to somewhere like Canada, my family came to America, and your family's in India, and they think, oh my God, you're wealthy in America, so you're working your butt off here while sending money back to India. So my parents did this, my dad did this a lot, where, especially when we were young, he wasn't making a lot of money, but he was always sending money back to his siblings or people just to help take care of them, because that's our culture, to help take care of people. And it becomes difficult, because it's that, at least for me, that cultural aspect of giving, which I like, taking care of family, but then also not making them reliant on you, because now once you start giving, then they're saying, well, I don't know how to do it. And so it's a very tough balance, and I don't have a good answer for you here, because I do like taking care of people. I like helping people, especially within my family. I wanna make sure I can take care of everyone. That's why I work hard, because I wanna make sure that I can give you. And so when I, because I have given money to people around me, my family and my friends. The way that I look at it is, I don't want that money back. I know when I give you money, I'm never gonna ask for it back, and I don't want it back. If you give it back to me, maybe I'll take it, but I'm never gonna ask for it back, and I will give based off of what I can, but I know that's money in my mind. I'm never getting back, and I have to be okay with that for myself. And if I'm okay with that, that's fine. And I think that's one of those things where, I don't, because I don't wanna mess up the relationship, right, with my family, that's more important to me. And so look, if I'm okay giving you $1,000, here's a thousand, never talk to me about it again. Right. And really that's it. And if I see you blow that money in dumb ways, guess what, when you ask me for another grand, you're not getting it. Yeah. You know, it's as simple as that. I'm gonna forget about it. I don't like arguing over money. I think that's very dirty and evil. So, you know, I am generous in that sense, but you know, I'm also very straightforward, where if I feel like, hey, I'm not gonna give it to you, I'm not gonna do it. Yeah. But I also don't sit here and ask for it back. But you're talking about protecting yourself legally. Legally, which means now having the right advisors, accountants, and insurance to protect you. And so when you start earning money, people are gonna try to reach into your pockets and get it also legally. I had a tenant in one of my properties, Sue my realistic company, because they said that the bathtub got too slippery when the water was on. Geez. And because it was so slippery when the water was on, it caused them to slip and fall, which then- It's a bathtub. It's a bathtub with water. And because of that, they wanted damages for injuries. But you just have to defend yourself, even if it's not your problem. And so this is where how do you protect yourself? So I had a couple of things. One, I had an LLC. Second, I had insurance. And third, I had a property manager company, property management company. And so I'll go through the different layers so you can see all the different levels of insurance and how they worked, because now the first thing that happens is my property management company documented everything, because prior to them slipping, they made a complaint that there was about a quarter inch by quarter inch chip in the bathtub. And they said, oh, there's a little paint chip. We wanna get this fixed. So my contractor goes out there. He says, okay, yeah, we can fix this. And my contractor said, you know, the tenants here are kind of old. Let's install them a handicap pole just to be nice. We weren't required to do this. We were fully licensed by the city, but my contractor offered to do this. So now they go back to do the work. The tenants say, we don't want you to do it, we're tired. He goes back to do it again. They said, we don't want you to do it. The tenant slipped and fell at a barbecue. They go back and said, no, he's still injured from the barbecue. So we have notes of all this. Sure. And then they go and say that they slipped and fell in the bathtub. We have records of all this where they said they slipped and fell at a barbecue. And now they're saying they slipped and fell at a bathtub. Why are they doing that? Well, maybe they can try to get some money out of the quote unquote rich landlord. I was a very young kid at this time. I was still in college trying to dig into those pockets, thinking that, oh, if he's a real estate investor, he must have a lot of money. And so they use one of those free attorneys to go after,","The discussion involves protecting oneself financially, mentally, and legally while giving money to family or friends. The speaker shares his personal experiences of cultural expectations of giving in his family and the challenges of balancing it with not making people reliant on him. He emphasizes the importance of protecting oneself legally by having the right advisors, accountants, and insurance. The speaker provides an example of how he protected himself by having an LLC, insurance, and a property management company when a tenant sued him. The discussion highlights the importance of being generous, but at the same time, being cautious and taking the necessary legal measures to protect oneself."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQXrWhcomdY_sep_2426_2748,fQXrWhcomdY_sep_2426_2748,"So, now I have insurance. So now my insurance company gives me an attorney to protect me through this process. And the judge laughed at the case, even the attorney laughed at the case, he was like, look man, this is just, they're just trying to grab money. There's nothing here. It's a frivolous lawsuit. So we just have to do it. And the insurance company wants to settle because it's cheaper to settle than to pay $350 to $400 an hour to the attorney to fight it and actually win the case. And so that's where the insurance came in and protected me. They fought me for me and defended me and then paid out the settlement. Now if it had escalated further, that's where the LLC protects me, which is where you want to have a good attorney there to recommend what's best for you because that LLC then kind of creates a shield where you can only take what the LLC owns and you can't go after my personal assets. So if the LLC only owns that property, you can't go after anything that I own because the LLC is what owns the real estate. So you want to make sure you protect yourself there. So this is where having those right shields to protect you are so important because especially in America, we are the most litigious country in the world and you want to make sure you protect yourself against that. And there's a funny saying in real estate that if you haven't been sued as a real estate investor, you haven't been in business long enough. So it's just one of those things where you want to protect yourself. I think people also got to also understand this is a full contact sport. You know, learning how to follow these six steps that you've laid out, which I think are great, but learning how to be an investor, it doesn't come easy for everyone right away. You're going to make some mistakes. There's going to be some challenges to face. And the longer you're in it, you just have to deal with stuff that's not fun, right? This is something you have to deal with. There's probably months of a back and forth thing and there's some stress, there's some worry, there's conversation. It's time, it's energy with insurance, with lawyers, just to deal with something that even isn't your fault. 100%. And you know, this is one of the realities of being an investor and entrepreneur, where you know, understanding the aspects and there are going to be some things that are not fun. Like I talked about in our previous podcast, the tax issue. There was a where my accountant calls me up saying that, hey, Jaspreet, this is nine in the morning. You owe $100,000 by the end of the day. Sucks. Send it into the IRS. That sucks. And now I have to go figure out how to do this, send it in. And then he tells me that I also have to pay a penalty on this because he did something wrong. So it's one of those things that's not fun. It's a problem. But then as an entrepreneur, how do you find the opportunity? Well, first I fired the accountant. I go on the hunt for a new accountant, a new tax advisor. I start working with this new tax advisor and I see the difference between a bad accountant and a good accountant. I started learning, wow, you're telling me that every month we can meet and you can advise me on what I can do with my money. That way I can legally limit my tax liability and you're going to do all this work in advance and I don't have to worry about this ever. I love that. Now with my entrepreneurial brain, I'm like, let's start working together because there's so many small businesses that need this. It is a real problem because there's a lot of bad accountants out there and we need more good accountants. We need more good tax advisors who are going to help people, especially in this new age where we have more IRS agents joining the workforce. We have a lot of things changing. We're probably going to see a change in tax laws. So you want to make sure that you're taking care of yourself. So this is one of the things that I'm working on with him is to fix that. We don't have a website or anything. So if you want to learn more, shoot me a DM on Instagram at Minority Mindset or email me at team at theminoritymindset.com. But this is just one of those things where you want to make sure you have the right resources there to first be great to protect yourself for your family. And I'm going to take that one step further because as an attorney, you also want to make sure you have the right estate planning in place because this is one of those things that is really not fun, but so crucial. If you build any sort of wealth, you want to tell the world and when I die, where's it going to go? Because if you don't, your family is going to fight over it. And it's not fun because no one wants to think about what happens after I die, but it is so, so, so important because when you die, you don't want your family fighting at your funeral. And so create a will, create a trust, have an estate planning attorney that can help guide you there because you never want to have to worry about that. And the second aspect of being great is being great for the world where the more you have, the more you can do. You can give back, you can do more things, whether it's your money, whether it's your time, whether it's your education, because when you can light a candle, well, you can light one candle, but that one candle can also light a million other candles. And this is where now as you're on this journey to build wealth, you have lit your own candle. Now you can help light someone else. You can help give someone a helping hand, whether you help someone financially, whether you help them with your time, whether you help them through your expertise because now you've learned the process because information is meant to be shared. I talk about this stuff on YouTube, not because I wanted to get rich, but because I was so frustrated by the system. I never knew that I could even make money on YouTube. I started making videos for free.","In this discussion, the speaker talks about the importance of protecting yourself with the right shields when investing in real estate in America, as the country is known for being the most litigious in the world. They describe how insurance and an LLC can be used to protect against lawsuits and personal asset loss, and emphasize the importance of having a good attorney to advise on the best protection strategies. The speaker also mentions the importance of having a good accountant to legally limit tax liability and create more opportunities for businesses, and highlights the need for estate planning to avoid family disputes over wealth distribution after death."

You can help people out. And again, through your money, through your time, through your education, there are so many ways that you can do this because the more you have, the more you can do. And now you've built this wealth and this is where now you want to be great for the world, not just for yourself. Yeah, man.

Appreciate you, my man. Appreciate you. If you enjoyed that interview, then I know you'll love what we have coming up right now. What do you recommend someone to do, whether they're an employee or maybe they have some extra cash? So I would say, you know, this is a lot going to depend on you because I'll be very personal with what I'm doing because I'm an entrepreneur. So I look for different types of opportunities and somebody else might. So if you are an employee, there's going to be different opportunities for you. If you're a business owner, there's going to be different opportunities for you. If you're an entrepreneur, there's different opportunities for you. So I invest my money in five places. Invest my money into my own business. I talked about market briefs. I invest my money into real estate, invest my money into stocks, invest my money into crypto, then I invest my money into physical gold. This is the order that I invest my money into. This is my type of diversification. Now I understand what's going on and I do have some cash. I always have some cash put aside for like, you know, things going wrong, investments. I always have some cash putting aside there. And what I've been doing is I passively invest my money, meaning no matter what's happening in the markets, whether the market is up, whether the market's down, it's automatically passive. And this is happening into stocks, into crypto, and into physical gold. That does not change. That never changes. So I get paid. Money is automatically invested no matter what. Then in the past, I've had my more active strategy where I would take money and actively go out and buy real estate, actively go out and buy stocks. And in this situation, I am looking for good deals, meaning a good price. So I haven't been doing that as much recently, not because of what's happening in the market, but because I see more opportunities for me in the entrepreneurial business side. So I've been investing money into market briefs like I talked about. Hiring more people on your team. Hiring more people building infrastructure. And then I'm also working on a tax firm. So I'm going to talk about tax for one second if that's okay, because it's a very interesting thing happening right now because going off of inflation. President Biden just signed something called the Inflation Reduction Act. Was it 80 billion or something? It was a huge, huge, huge, I think it's even bigger than that. 80 billion is just the IRS. So the tax side. So they're hiring, they're investing 80 billion in the IRS to start auditing more people essentially, right? To start trying to get more money from people. And that's only one part of the Inflation Reduction Act. So let's go big to go small because the Inflation Reduction Act is supposed to reduce inflation. That's what the name says. The fun is, I'm laughing because it's kind of silly because how do you reduce inflation? You spend less money because the government has spent so much money they didn't have, which caused money printing. You tax more people, bro. You collect more. Exactly. So that's how do you now pay off all this debt? Remember, the government doesn't make money. They tax you, they tax me, they collect taxes and then that's what they use to pay off their expenses. Now, it's not surprising that the government is running into an issue because they have 31 almost 31 almost 31 almost 31.","The discussion includes the importance of financial education and ways to invest money for building wealth and achieving financial freedom. The speaker recommends investing in one's own business, real estate, stocks, crypto, and physical gold. They also discuss passive investing and active investing strategies, including seeking good deals and investing in infrastructure and personnel for one's business. Additionally, the speaker briefly mentions the Inflation Reduction Act signed by President Biden, which includes investing in the IRS to audit more people for tax collection to pay off the government's debt."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQXrWhcomdY_sep_3086_3370,fQXrWhcomdY_sep_3086_3370,"to print more money, but they can't do that anymore because of inflation or they're going to need more tax dollars. So that's one of the reasons why through this Inflation Reduction Act, one of the things they want to do, which is one of the most like financially interesting topics, is they want to invest very heavily billions of dollars into the IRS to help them beef up and collect more tax dollars and past tax dollars. Now, I do want to clear up some of the false information out there because the Act is working to hire 87,000 more IRS workers. That's crazy. It is crazy, especially considering that today there are about 80,000 IRS workers. They're going to double. Yes and no. So the 87,000 people that they're hiring are not all IRS agents and they're not all being hired today. They're going to be hired over the course of 10 years and the whole idea is this is what they say. Again, this is what they're saying. What might happen is it could be a little bit different. So I want to be just completely transparent because I don't want to mislead people. I want to make sure everyone's fully understanding what's happening. You have about, what's scheduled is about 50,000 or so people in the IRS are scheduled to retire over the next 10 years. So these 87,000 people are supposed to replace them and beef up the agents that are actually going to be doing the auditing to go and collect more money. Now, even if 50,000 people retire, that's still adding almost 50% more people to the IRS. Who are they going after? Well, they say the wealthy, the super rich and there's about a thousand billionaires in the United States. Do you need tens of thousands of people to go after them? No. So you go a little bit deeper. Now again, what do we look at? History. I look at history to answer the question because they keep saying that we're not going, saying it's not in the bill, it's not written anywhere. This is what they say that we're not going to go after middle income people or anything like that. Well, in 2021, 50% of IRS audits were on people earning less than $75,000 a year. Come on. 50%. 50%. 50%. How do they know? Is that public information? Go search it on Google. Wow. Google has a lot of information. 50% of the audits were on people that were making less than under $75,000 a year. Wow. And why are they doing that? Well, probably because if you're making less money, you're not going to have the resources to hire a good accountant and hire a good attorney to represent you. So it's a little bit easier, less cost. I mean, it's just easier, right? I mean, you're maybe less financially savvy than somebody who's making half a million dollars a year or $2 million a year because now you probably have more resources to defend yourself. So that's a bigger fight for the IRS and you're probably more protected because you have good advisors who've told you what to do because now let's say you're making- You're filing your taxes, you're doing all the right steps and maybe- If you make a million, once you start making a lot of money, like if you're making over a million dollars a year, you're not trying to play the game of trying to hide $10,000 because now you're already under scrutiny. The IRS is trying to see you do something wrong. And so if you try to get $10,000 under the table, it's a bad idea because you already know you're being watched. You do everything by the book. You're trying to be the best. You try to and you have good advisors to guide you to do everything legal so you can pay the least amount of taxes possible legally. Now, if you're making 50 grand a year and you have a side hustle making you a thousand dollars a year, you might take that in cash because you might say, this is a grand a year. It's just the reality, right? You're taking pictures at people's weddings, you're doing whatever, you're making some cash and you're just doing it under the table. And the IRS wants that thousand bucks. And this is one of those things where it's not surprising because if you look at what's been happening over the last couple of years, this has almost been a foreshadow of things to come because you remember over the last couple of years, we've seen this new rule on Venmo, right? On Venmo transactions where they want all Venmo transactions over $600 or something like that where now, if you're, unless you're a photographer and you're taking pictures at your friend's wedding and he pays you $700 and Venmo has to report that, they want to know that. They never said why, but now you're starting to see all these things start to add up where if you're doing these small things, it's just like things starting to fall into place where, oh, no wonder they started wanting all these details for this. No wonder they started really going after cryptocurrency brokerages. No wonder they really started doing all of this stuff, maybe creating a digital dollar because they want to be able to see every transaction, which means they want to be able to tax every transaction. Of course, I can't validate this, but I mean, it's just like puzzle pieces starting to come together. And so this is where the tax thing, why is it so important? Because of inflation, because of the national debt, the government needs more tax dollars to be able to go and fund their payments.","The Inflation Reduction Act proposes to invest billions of dollars into the IRS to hire 87,000 workers over 10 years to help collect more tax dollars and past tax dollars from the wealthy and super-rich. However, in 2021, 50% of IRS audits were on people earning less than $75,000 a year, indicating that the IRS has been targeting middle-income people as well. The additional workers are supposed to replace the 50,000 IRS workers scheduled to retire over the next 10 years and beef up the agents that will be doing the auditing to collect more money. The proposed investment is meant to help the IRS collect more taxes and close loopholes that are being used to evade taxes. The act aims to prevent inflation and stabilize the economy."

I keep saying that I'm sure your audience is getting very bored of me saying this. But I mean, it's what the best indicator because I can't look into the future and say what's gonna happen. But I can look in the past and see what has happened. And I see that, hey, this is what happened in 2021. This is what's been happening because this is just the situation. And so for me, I've also seen a big difference between good tax advisors and bad tax advisors. Because that way you're starting a tax. That's why because I, you know, it's the entrepreneurial mind where when I get scammed, I get screwed over, I get, you know, these things happen. It makes me want to find a new solution. That's how I started Minority Mindset. I got scammed and I started Minority Mindset. I got screwed over when I started my band planning company. I got completely screwed over my first real estate investment deal. Pretty much every part of me had to do with something really bad happening. So I had a really bad tax advisor. He was really just an accountant who filed my taxes and was never on time. And I got this call. It's horrible. It was just a mess. I got a call from my accountant one day. I'm in the office. This is right before my morning huddle. So we have a 930 a.m. morning huddle calls me I think it was like 845 in the morning. I'm in the office. He says, Hey, Jaspreet, how are you? I said, Good, how you doing? He said, Hey, listen, I need you to do me something. Can you wire or send the IRS $100,000 by the end of the day today? And can you also send about $15,000 to the state government by the end of the day today? I was like, what? He said, Sorry, we had some miscalculations. We did something wrong. We missed this and you need to send this by tonight. And I was like, Jeez, are you serious? Yeah, one more thing. You're probably gonna have to pay a penalty on this as well. And this is a completely true story. Like, when was this? This is not I mean, this is less than a year ago. Oh, my gosh. And so it's I mean, it's painful. It's very painful. And so I'm like, okay, like, I was very frustrated because I'm like, what did I do wrong? Like, what do you talk about? So you didn't do anything wrong. And I was like, well, if I'm the one that has to pay this, and I'm the one who has to pay the penalty, something's not right here. And so I paid it. And then I fired him. Pretty quickly, right? Because I you know, that's, that's not the way I like to do business. I like I want I want everything to be clean. But I also want people who care about what they do. And he was a cheaper accountant. Yeah, I got what I paid for. And so I went on the hunt for to find a top of the line accountant, and I pay a lot more than what I used to. However, the situation scenario is extremely different because he has a very different personality about a persona. And the way it works now is one he manages all my books on time and handle schedule. So every month he meets me and he shows me Hey, just read. Here's your profit. Sorry, we'll start from the top. Here's your revenue. Here's your expenses. Here's what your expenses look like. Here's how they changed. Here's your profit. Here's your tax liability. And here are the things that you can do to limit your tax liability. That's cool. Here are you know, three recommendations or whatever that we believe based off of what's happening right now, to legally limit your tax liability. And he has given me so many interesting ideas, because the tax code is over 2000 pages long. And you need I'm an attorney, I studied a lot of tax, it takes a lot of knowledge and education to understand and read the tax code. But then things keep changing all the time. Like even this inflation reduction act is changing corporate tax structure. So you need somebody who literally eats, breeds, and all they care about is tax. And this is this guy, right? And I'm like, dude, like, this is amazing. Like, I love this, because I don't have the time. I don't want to spend my time thinking about taxes and all the cash flow stuff. I want to build my business. And so I got to know him, got to build, see how we worked. I really liked it. And after a number of months of working with him and seeing him in action, I was like, hey, man, like, you have nothing on social media. Like, can we work together? Like, let's like, he's very good at what he does. But I was like, let me work with you. Like, I think we can create a lot of things here, because there's a lot of small businesses that need what you have to offer. Because there's a lot of small businesses who have bad accountants, who all they do is file their taxes. And you need a tax advisor, especially now as we're gonna see a big change, you need an advisor who's going to guide you on what to do with your money, how to document what you do, like just to make it completely seamless. That way, you don't have to stress about it. Right. And he was like, I'm down. So over the last couple of months, we've been working to build this together. It's not launched yet. We're just talking about it because it came a conversation. But that's something that I've been really working on. So, you know, if you're listening to this, and you want a good tax advisor, just email me, they go at the minority mindset calm, or send me a DM on Instagram minority mindset, and I will connect you. But these are I mean, this is where what am I doing? I like entrepreneurship. I like this stuff, because it gets me excited. It's the way that my brain works. It's the way that gets you my purpose, right. And so I do that. I like investing in real estate. I like investing in stocks. I'm passively doing it in stocks. But right now I just see more and more and more and more and more and more","The speaker believes that history is the best indicator for predicting what will happen in finance. He emphasizes that the quality of a tax advisor can make a significant difference in one's finances. He tells a story about being scammed by a bad accountant who failed to file taxes correctly and later demanded that he pay an extra $100,000 to the IRS. The speaker then found a top-tier tax advisor who provided valuable advice on tax liability and gave him many ideas on how to legally minimize it. He believes that having a good tax advisor is crucial for small businesses, and he subsequently collaborated with his tax advisor to offer tax advisory services to other small businesses."

I get to meet really cool people. So it's a matter of now, what is that lifestyle? Now, if I wasn't an entrepreneur, what would I be doing? Yeah, I'd be stacking up cash to find good investments either in the stock market or the real estate market or to buy a startup because it's very accessible now thanks to the internet, thanks to all the crowdfunding sites out there. And I'd be passively investing. I would not change that. So I think everybody should be doing this. You can put a hundred bucks a month away into stocks or into an automated account that is investing for you. Did you know if you're 21 and you start investing a hundred dollars a month and you never change that and you just get a 10% return on your money, which is the average stock market return, and you do that until you're 65, you will retire a millionaire. Come on. We're talking about less than $4 a day. In your opinion, would you buy a home when interest rates is over, or I mean, yeah, when interest rates is over 10% or you feel like even though you're getting a massive discount, you're paying more every month, would you consider that or you just wait until interest rates go down? So I look at home buying very differently than the majority of people. I look at buying a home the way I buy a shirt. For me, a home is not an asset. It's a liability. So what does that mean? I want to buy a home because I want to create memories. I want to buy an investment property or an investment because I want to make money. So if you're buying a home because you think, oh, I want to get rich because of my home, I think you're looking at it the wrong way because you should be looking at your home as I want to make memories here. I want to live here and I want to grow my family here and I want to spend time here. If that's the reason why you want to buy a home, what you should be paying attention to is not what's going on in the markets, not what's going on with interest rates, but instead, what you should do is say, can I afford it? And what does that mean? Can I afford the down payment? Can I afford the monthly payment? Property taxes. Can I afford property tax? The fix-ups. The fix-ups. The move-in costs. And then you move in like the furniture upgrades. So if you can afford it, then you buy. If you can't afford it, if you're stretching yourself too thin, you don't buy it because what happens to so many people is you get sucked into trying to time the market. But again, if interest rates drop and you own a home, you can refinance. And so, remember, understand the reason. So it's almost good to buy it when interest rates are high if you can get the house on discount. And then if in a year or two that the interest rates drop in half, you can refinance. Just make sure you can afford it. That's the biggest thing. You have to be able to afford it because if you are stretching yourself too thin, going paycheck to paycheck, you live in a home, you're hurting yourself because now what you're doing, you don't have the ability to invest in other places. You cannot invest your money. Do you think people will be able to actually buy a home in five to seven years? It depends on what the Fed does. If the Fed cuts interest rates when we go into a recession, if so our economy slows down, the Fed starts cutting interest rates, mortgage rates go back down, you're going to see a bigger flood of cash into the housing market and that will create a bigger wealth gap and it will make it significantly more difficult for the regular person to buy a home. Home ownership will become a real American nightmare because it will be so difficult for the regular person. We will turn into essentially a renter nation where homes are owned not even by regular investors, but corporations. They've been buying up... Blackstone's been buying up a ton of homes, right? Yeah, Blackrock's buying like... Blackrock or Blackstone? Yeah, they're buying one out of every four homes in certain neighborhoods. That's crazy. Yeah. And so... Which means they believe people aren't going to be able to afford them and they're going to have to rent from them. Yes. And so it's a crazy time to understand that, which is why, again, I look at the home like a liability. Can you afford it? Yes, then buy it. If not, then don't set yourself too thin. I used to be a real estate salesperson and the reason why this is so important is because when I was a salesperson, what they say is you want to tell people this is their biggest investment of their life. So buy a home that you love. Now, again, real estate agents are not bad people. Banks are not... Bankers are not necessarily bad. Peeps are really bad.","The discussion covers topics related to finance and investing. The speaker expresses enthusiasm for investing in things like a tax firm, meeting cool people, and finding good investments either in the stock market or real estate market. The speaker recommends passive investing by putting a hundred dollars a month away into stocks or an automated account. They also emphasize the importance of being able to afford a home before buying it, regardless of interest rates. The speaker suggests that buying a home should be based on creating memories and not solely for making money. They caution against trying to time the market and recommend being able to afford down payments, monthly payments, property taxes, fix-ups, and move-in costs before buying a home. The discussion also touches upon the possibility of people being able to buy a home in the future and the potential impact of the Fed cutting interest rates and corporations buying up homes."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQXrWhcomdY_sep_3972_4262,fQXrWhcomdY_sep_3972_4262,"further because I want that home. And so what does that do? Well, it makes the banker richer, it makes the real estate agent a bigger commission check, and they walk away. Now you have to deal with it. If you can afford it, great, but if you start to struggle with it, you're the one that has to deal with the problem by yourself. And so what happens for so many people is your home is a money pit until you sell it. And then you have to hope that you sell it for a profit. Because there's no guarantee, right? We don't know where home prices are going to be in five years or ten years. I can't predict that. I don't know what the Fed is going to do. And so the main thing that you have to understand if you're thinking about buying a home is ignore the markets, ignore what's going on in the world. Can you afford it today? And please do me a favor, okay? I very rarely try to tell people what to do because I feel like, you know, I try to... I want you to be educated so you can make smart decisions for yourself. But the one time that I really tried to give people, like I say, don't do this, is when it comes to adjustable rate mortgages because they've been making a huge comeback now because now the interest rates are five and a half percent. People say, I missed out on the opportunity to get a loan mortgage. And now I have been seeing a huge growth of adjustable rate mortgages because now banks will say, don't pay five and a half percent on a home, pay 3.7% today and it's a five-one arm. Meaning, after five years, it's going to readjust. And then your mortgage payments will readjust. And if it goes higher, don't worry, you can just refinance out. And it is so risky because we don't know where interest rates are going to be. If they go up and they go up significantly and now you're like, oh my God, let's just say mortgage rates are 10%. I don't want to pay three times more for my mortgage from $800 a month to $2,400 a month. I can't afford that, so let me refinance. Well, if you do that and home prices have dropped and you can't refinance because the bank says, well, you don't have enough equity in the home, I'm not going to refinance you. And then you can't sell because you're underwater, well, now you're in a tough situation. So pay a little bit more, get that fixed rate mortgage because if mortgage rates do drop, refinance and lock it in because other countries in the world don't always even have the option to do a 30-year fixed. We do, but an arm and adjustable rate mortgage is significantly more risky. The only time that I would say an arm is okay is if you are like 100% confident that you're going to be able to pay off the home during that initial teaser rate because if you cannot, then you are taking on a huge gamble with the home that you live in, with your family's livelihood. It's one thing if you do it with an investment, but with the home that you live in, avoid that extra risk and just lock in the rate, please. Right. I'm curious. Here's a question we got from people on YouTube. If someone has between a thousand and ten thousand dollars today to invest, they can spend on whatever they want. And they had to turn it into a hundred thousand within three years. What steps should they take? And obviously this is not a guarantee, but if you're like, you have to turn this one thousand into a hundred thousand or ten thousand to a hundred thousand, what would you invest in right now and how would you manage it over the next couple of years? So I'm going to give you kind of a longer answer than maybe you were hoping for on this one. I'm going to start by telling you what you should not do. Because the first time I remember, I had a thousand dollars extra on my bank account. I was in high school. And what I did with that is I took the thousand dollars and I went out and I bought a watch. Don't do that. Yeah. And this watch was very studded up. It was all crystals. And I was like, ooh, it's a nice watch. So what happened with that watch? Well, I made that watch company richer. I made the jewelry store owner richer. And now the thousand dollar watch that is worth maybe 50 bucks. It was just a show. So my value of my investment dropped like a rock. But now these companies made money, which now they could take that and invest in more products, more inventory, more marketing, more whatever. So the first thing is you got to understand that you want to put it in something that's going to help make you more money. So I'll give you my personal experience because I saw the biggest returns by investing in me, but that will be more of an active investment. And then you have the opportunity for a passive investment, which is why it's a longer answer than what you were probably hoping for. But I'll try to get to all the answers there. So I feel like everybody who, especially if you had the entrepreneurial mindset, you go through these phases where you first go through this like I'm a hustler, side hustler phase, and maybe you become like a solopreneur and then you become an entrepreneur and then you become a small business owner and then you kind of go to that business So you kind of go through these phases because initially when I first started as a side hustler, I don't know what entrepreneurship was. I was trying to make some cash on the side. Exactly. You just started off, starting off, starting off, starting off, starting off, starting off, starting off, starting off.","The discussion covers the topics of buying a home, adjustable rate mortgages, and investing money. When considering buying a home, it is important to focus on what you can afford today and avoid adjustable rate mortgages, which are significantly more risky. It is recommended to pay a little more and get a fixed rate mortgage, and if mortgage rates drop, refinance and lock it in. When investing money, it is important to avoid buying items that have no resale value and instead invest in something that will make you more money. The speaker suggests investing in yourself, as an active investment, or in passive investments such as low-cost index funds or real estate. The speaker also suggests being aware of the risks involved and being willing to put in the effort to make informed investment decisions."

Makes you feel cool. Makes you feel exclusive. You get to walk past the line. You have this lanyard that says you're this VIP, whatever. And so now I have people at some of the biggest colleges in my area passing out flyers trying to get everybody to come because now you want to be one of those people. So now I got these free salespeople that are trying to promote it. You have to be creative. And that now starts to multiply the money. And that's when I realized that I'm just a side hustler. I will never be able to build a business on this. I don't want to build a business like this because it was a very dirty industry, which is why I got out of it. I did not like the scene. So I left that and started kind of going down more the entrepreneurship route, not going more into innovation. So I started a sock company. So now I'm starting to invest money, my own dollars into the sock company. That way now I can build a product, build inventory, build a website, build advertising, build marketing. And now we're able to grow this much faster because now I have some skills that I learned from my mistakes because I screwed up a lot. My first event was a complete flop. I had some very bad failures. I had lost money on some occasions. When you deal with club owners, you're dealing with very interesting people and you learn very quickly. I'm a 17-year-old going up to some of these club owners trying to figure out the game and they're taking advantage of you. And it's also dangerous. I remember one time I went to a club to talk to the manager because we had a party the next week and I said, where's the manager? He said, oh, we got stabbed last night. Oh man. And so you learn very quickly to protect yourself, to protect your own interests. I mean, there was a lot of physical stuff that happened. I mean, I got involved with the bouncer. So you learn to protect yourself physically, learn to protect yourself mentally, learn to protect yourself financially. So I had to learn very quickly. And so now I take things that I learned. I'm in a much safer, much smoother, much cleaner industry, the sock industry, but I start to learn and I start to apply some of the same marketing. How can I be creative in the marketing? How can I get people to learn? And you can't learn this in a textbook. You just have to try, be willing to fail. And so same thing there. Now I kind of go to the entrepreneurship route and now I'm starting to learn and I start to sell. And then I realized my passion isn't in socks. I like the socks. I like the business idea, but my passion isn't there. My passion is more on the financial side. So now I was also doing minority mindset as a hobby. Minority mindset starts to grow. And then I start to build things like Market Briefs, which is our financial newsletter. So now I'm building Market Briefs and now I'm turning more into like from the entrepreneur to the small business side, because in Market Briefs, I am not the only worker. On the Minority Mindset channel, it's my face, it's me talking. And we have video editors and all that, but it's mainly me. If I'm not working in Minority Mindset, we're not making any more content and it's not growing, which is okay. It's not for me as my business. For me, it's my way of helping to pursue my passion and my mission to help spread this sort of financial education, the things that I was never taught. But my business, now Market Briefs, we have a whole team. We have people that lead the creative side, that write the news every day. We have the business development team. We have the operations people. So we have a full team that are doing it. And if I were to not go into work tomorrow or if something were to happen to me, the business will continue without me. And so, it's a matter of flipping that money into the next thing to the next and being willing to invest the time, the education. So for me, it took me a solid decade. So I don't have a better... In three years, I couldn't figure out how to do it. It took me a long time to figure it out. Maybe you could do it now. Now is... You start a thousand into a hundred thousand. I could do it significantly faster than a year. I think one of the things is that I'm hearing you say is invest that thousand into a skill. Invest it into a skill. You will get the best return. And put it into... That could be, okay, I'm going to buy a camera. And for the next two years, master becoming great at using the camera, whether it be video or photography, and then start working with clients and making some side income and using that money to reinvest in more equipment. Exactly. Using that money to maybe have someone else help me to scale my side business and then have that cash to invest in other things as well. And then develop new skills, new skill and new skill. And it takes that mindset though and the willingness to take risk because I would also caution that because you have to be willing to just try. When I started Minority Mindset, I didn't have a camera. I didn't have any fancy equipment. I started recording videos off my phone. And I was like, I'm not going to invest so much money into this when I'm trying to... It's a hobby for me. See where it goes. See where it goes. But I did take an acting class. I was in law school. So I was in law school part time. I was working on my business full time. And then I took an acting class in the evenings, night school because I was like, I've never talked in front of a camera before.","The speaker talks about their journey from a side hustle to entrepreneurship, starting with promoting parties for clubs, then moving on to selling socks, and eventually founding a financial education company called Minority Mindset. The speaker emphasizes the importance of investing in skills to get the best return on investment, taking risks, being creative in marketing, and being willing to fail. They also caution that entrepreneurship takes time and patience to figure out, and that it's essential to be willing to try new things and take risks."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQXrWhcomdY_sep_4682_4924,fQXrWhcomdY_sep_4682_4924,"to achieve something bigger because I saw how hard my parents had. I saw how hard my grandparents had. My grandparents were refugees. They lost their homes. They lost everything. They had to fight for their lives. And so I saw the things that my family had to go through. My grandparents raised me. They lived with me. So I lived with my grandparents and my parents. So I heard their stories, talked about the struggles, and that was where I started to get my basis of financial education because my grandfather would tell me, and he actually repeated this to me a couple of weeks ago and I was on the phone with him. And he was like, you know, the biggest and worst disease is porness because he said, I grew up and I saw extreme poverty. So my family is from a state in India called Punjab. And in 1947, our home, the state of Punjab was severed by the government. And if you were sick, a member of the religion that I am, and you're on the west side of Punjab, you had to migrate east, otherwise you were going to be killed. So my grandparents were on the west side. And you literally had to like run. Like my grandfather, all he had was a clothes on his back and a sword in his hand. And as they were coming across, they got attacked by a mob. And he saw his uncle get his head chopped open right in front of him. No way. He had a fight. And so he put his uncle on a horse and that was the end. Holy cow. He got to the new side of India now and he's there. He lost his shoes on the way. He has no home, no money, no anything. And so he says, I saw extreme porness. And when you're in that level of porness, forget helping other people. You can't even feed yourself. How can you feed your family? If you can't feed your family, you can't feed another hungry person. What would you say are the three biggest myths about money that you've debunked over your time of learning about money that maybe you grew up thinking it was one way, like you were talking about loans and banks and all these different things. What are three myths about money that you've found out were not true? The first thing that I would say, I don't know if it's a myth, but I would say that the first thing everyone has to understand is what money is. And I don't mean in terms of wealth, but money is just paper. It doesn't make you a good person. It doesn't make you a bad person. It's paper. And we talk about all these insecurities people have with money. I grew up being told, don't talk about money. Don't worry about money. Don't stress about money. Yeah, here I am seeing my parents work their butt off every single day. So trying to make money. Trying to make money. And it doesn't make sense. How am I supposed to not worry about money? And you want me to become a doctor because you read those, if you go to those career fairs, they show you the different careers, right? And doctors always number one, the highest income. So why am I doing this if it's because of the income instead of because I love it or do something that I love? Why not because I want to help people? Yeah. You want to save lives. Exactly. And what's crazy is if you understand money, you become financially educated, you're willing to talk about it. Well, now you can be financially stable doing whatever you want and you can follow something you love and still be financially okay because we assume that you have to have this in order to make money. You have to have this job in order to make good money. You have to have this career if you want to be financially stable. But that's a complete lie. But that goes down to not us being willing to talk about money. And I talked about this in our last interview, but money is one part of our lives. And the reason why people are scared to talk about it is because we're insecure about it. And that's because we don't understand how money plays a part in our lives. It's one aspect. I said that there's four. You have to be physically healthy, mentally healthy, spiritually healthy, and then financially healthy. If you're not financially healthy, well, it can make everything else much more miserable because you can't pay your bills. But if you're financially healthy, you're rich, but you have nothing else, more money just makes you more miserable. So you need to live a holistic life and understand how money plays a part in your life. That way the finances can have the biggest power and then you understand that more money just amplifies who you are. It's like fire. It's like fuel. It fuels your fire. If you're a good person and you have more money, you have a tool to do more good. If you're a bad person, you have more money, you have a tool to do more bad. Just why we need more good people with money.","The person discussing their financial education has been influenced by their grandparents' experiences as refugees and extreme poverty in India. They believe that money is just paper and it doesn't define a person's worth. They also debunk the myth that certain careers are the only way to achieve financial stability and suggest that financial education is important to understanding how money plays a part in a holistic life. They emphasize the importance of being physically, mentally, spiritually, and financially healthy, and that more money amplifies who a person is, whether good or bad. They advocate for more good people to have money to do more good in the world."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQXrWhcomdY_sep_4989_5305,fQXrWhcomdY_sep_4989_5305,"talking about here is you can use your money as a tool and this is what wealthy people do because now what do they do with their money? You use your money to buy your time back because what so many of us do is we're exchanging our hours for dollars. You go to work every single day and you get paid, but what are wealthy people doing? They're not working just to use their money as a way to buy hours. They're using the money to buy their time back because now you can build things and processes and invest your money because now you can use your money as a tool instead of as a fool. That's what I like to say. This is where it's how do you now use your money to make your life better? You don't want to be now just buying a whole bunch of Gucci and Louis Vuitton. It's now actually improving your life. Not to make your life look better, but to actually improve it from the inside out. So the simplest example would be you start a YouTube channel. We talked about buying a camera. One thing that you could do is you can hire a video editor. You go on a freelance site, hire a freelance video editor, and now what are you doing? You can spend more time making more videos instead of spending all your time editing the content so you can focus on your time. You can hire someone to mow the lawn. You bought your time back. You can hire somebody to help get you your groceries. You buy your time back. It costs money. You have to spend money in order to do that, but you're getting something in an exchange and now you're buying your time back so you can use your money as a tool and you can use your money as a tool to buy your time back or you can use your money as a tool to make you and attract you more money. That's what wealthy people do and so you want to be able to use money in that way. The third thing would be now to really, I mean I know I talk about this a lot, but you have to understand the difference between something that makes you money and something that loses you money. That's a liability, yeah. A liability. And what are the main liabilities that people spend on today? The way you look, man. We have this Instagram flex culture, right? And it is very toxic if you do not know how to use it. And unless you're investing your money wisely and you've got excess money and you're like, okay, I want to buy some stuff to flex, cool. But if you're not investing your money and you're just spending it on clothes and watches and shoes to look good, then it's like... If you got the name brand stuff, but you got no savings, you got no investments, you're doing something wrong. Your priority is in the wrong place. What are you doing? You're making Gucci rich, you're making Louis Vuitton rich, you're making all these companies rich but you're keeping yourself broke. When I talked about my watch, I spent a grand on a watch. I had no investments. I didn't even know what an investment was at the time. I didn't realize I could have taken that grand and invested it into a watch company and get a share of the profits. But that's how wealthy people are doing and they understand that. And there's nothing wrong with spending money. There's nothing wrong with having luxuries. There's nothing wrong with having the nice things. But it's a matter of when can you actually afford it. You have to know when the right time is for you to have it because you want to first make yourself rich and then, hey, if you can afford it, do whatever you want. Greg Cardone was always talking about how he doesn't spend money on the cash he makes to buy watches or things. He only spends money on the watches and clothes and things on the passive income. That's great. From his investments. You take the earned income, you're working every single day. You take this income and you use as much of that as possible to invest into assets. The assets pay you, live off of the assets. Now, those assets don't need you to go to work every single day to get paid. So if you break your leg and you can't get paid, you're not getting that earned income, but that active, the passive income from your assets still coming in. And now, if that's the money you're living off of, you are free. Your earned income is just buying you more assets. And so how do you start that? Right? And so this is where you have to kind of build some sort of system for yourself. And the rule that I would always say is follow something like my rule of five. If you can't buy five of them, you can't afford one of them. So if you want to buy a $1,000 phone, you want to buy a $1,000 watch, okay, fine. Can you buy five of them? And if you don't have the ability to buy five of them, if you can't afford to do that, then you can't afford one. If you can't buy five, you can't afford one. And then you want to create a system, like a system that automates your finances where now you have something going on with your money that is putting your money to work no matter what. One of the easiest things, you can create your own, is to follow something like a 75-15-10 plan, which means that for every dollar you earn from now on, 75 cents is the maximum you can spend. 15 cents is the minimum you're investing and 10 cents is the minimum that you're saving. Now the savings is, you want to build something between three and 12 months worth of savings if you want to have that protection. Three months if you don't have a lot of liability, a lot of responsibilities, you don't have all that going on and you have a high risk tolerance. 12 months if you want to play it safe. You figure out what's right for you after you filled your savings, you fill up the savings, you don't want to put any more money into it because now you're just being eaten away by inflation. The savings is not there to make you wealthy, it's there just to protect you against an emergency. Then what you do is you take the money, put it into your investments and now you just keep investing money. Now what happens is as you grow your income, you don't change this ratio. So if you go from $40,000 a year to $400,000 a year, you keep the same ratio and you're still investing first.","This discussion is about how to use your money wisely. Wealthy people use their money to buy back their time, invest in assets, and create passive income streams. They don't just use it to buy material possessions that don't appreciate in value. The speaker advises people to prioritize investments over liabilities and to follow the rule of five - if you can't buy five of something, you can't afford one. The speaker also recommends creating a system that automates your finances, such as a 75-15-10 plan, where 75% of your earnings goes to expenses, 15% to savings, and 10% to investing. The ultimate goal is to create financial freedom by using your money as a tool to make more money."

So wealthy people invest and spend what's left while the majority of people spend and invest whatever's left. Here's one that I think a lot of people do and I think it hurts them in a big way. How does someone not make their net worth attached to their self worth? That's a good one. Meaning how do they believe in themselves, have confidence, have love for themselves when they're not making that much? Maybe they're in a transition, maybe they lost their job, maybe they're just starting out and how do they also when they start making some cash not tie their bank account number to their self worth? So when you fail at something, you don't become a failure as a person. You fail at a task and in order to become successful at something, you have to fail at a lot of tasks. And so the first thing you have to understand that about yourself is that just because something didn't work, just because you failed at something does not mean that you are a failure. Maybe you failed at a task. I failed at a ton of things. You have to screw up a lot and that's how you find the good. So now when it comes to net worth, if you want to be completely honest, your net worth is pretty useless. It's a worthless number. It means nothing. It means less than nothing because what is net worth? It's a paper number. If I have a million dollars net worth in the stock market today, tomorrow can be worth 400,000. If you are valuing your life and even worse, if you are spending based off of your net You're living a very dangerous life and some people do do this because they say, oh, I'm worth a million dollars. So I'm going to go out and live a million dollar lifestyle. You don't have a million dollars. You're just worth a million dollars. You don't have income coming in. You're just worth this amount of money. And so you go and borrow a ton of money and you start living this million dollar lifestyle and that things go down and now you're the first one to lose your shirt. So the thing that I want you to remember is first regarding the failure. You're not a failure. Just because you failed at a task does not mean you're a failure. It's actually a good thing you failed because that means you're one step closer to finding that success. And then second, regarding the actual net worth number. Look, this is just temporary. Everything is temporary and you have the opportunity to build something a lot bigger. You have to have the right mindset. And if you are here in America, you're in a first world country, you have the opportunity to do that. But you have to be willing to learn and be willing to give it time. So you have to be patient but also impatient at the same time. And then in the sense that you have to understand that Get Rich Quick is majority of the time a big scam. It doesn't work. It makes the people selling the Get Rich Quick rich, keep getting broke. So the first thing you have to understand is that. But then second is you want to be impatient where you got to, it's going to fuel that drive, fuel that work ethic, fuel that discipline. You have to be willing to keep going. If you would have told me 15 years ago or 10 years ago, hey man, you're going to be interviewing with Lewis on this show. I would never thought that's possible. I grew up being told somebody like me can't do this. I remember talking to my own family members that you can never be a CEO of a company. Somebody like you can't do that. You have no business background. You couldn't even get into business school. And it's funny nowadays, I'm like, well, there's a lot more value to be the owner of a company than CEO of a company because the CEO is working for the owner. But anything is possible. And even if you just ignore the financial side, you can do anything you want. You want to be a singer, you want to be an actor, you want to be an entrepreneur, you want to be a CEO, you want to be whatever you want to do. It is possible, but you have to believe it and you have to be willing to put in that work. You know, hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard. That is the truest saying that you can make because I have worked in the event planning space. I still know a lot of people in this space. I know a lot of people that manage singers, big time singers, especially in the Indian space. Some of these people are incredibly talented with no drive, no work ethic. And where are they going with their careers? They had this spike and then going down. I know these other people that are average singers, but they're putting out songs day after day after day. I mean, if you heard them sing, it's like, you know, it's whatever, but you can produce it well, you can make the hooks, you can write cool lyrics. And they keep putting out content and they keep improving every week. And it's like, dang, you've got millions and millions and millions of views. It's funny, man. I got a friend of mine I've had on the show, Andy Grammer, who was literally in Santa Monica busking for four years, five days a week, four years playing songs for just tips on the streets. But he, I think he said he did like, he wrote like over a thousand songs or something crazy like this in this four year period. He would sing the covers to try to get like people to come around. Oh, I like that song. Let me give you a dollar. And then he would throw in one of his own original songs to try to get people like, oh, he's got his own stuff. But he does for four years before he actually got something that was on the radio and then touring and all these other things. Four years on the streets, just working really hard. Now he's got momentum, but he's got all these skills now developing over those years to write his own songs. And I don't think people realize what four years means because you share four years. Oh, you know, college is four years, high school is four years. But you got to remember during those four years, that's a long time. You go from January, February, March, April, May, do it again and again and again and again. Steve Harvey, I love his story because he went through the same thing. He was homeless because he was like, I'm a janitor right now. I want to be a comedian. My friend who I grew up with is now on TV. We both had the same dreams. I didn't want to say it. He got laughed at for his dreams. And now he's the one on TV living my dream and I'm working as a janitor, quit his job, moved into his car and spent three years just trying to make it. Look at him. He's on shows after shows after shows. He's crushing it. It's that discipline, being willing to put in the work and just sticking with it is so hard and that can help you and that can help you and that can help you and that can help you and that can help you.","The discussion covers two main points. The first point is about the relationship between net worth and self-worth. The speaker advises people not to attach their net worth to their self-worth as net worth is a paper number that is temporary and does not define who they are as a person. He also warns against living a lifestyle based on net worth, as this can be dangerous and lead to financial ruin. The second point is about the importance of hard work, discipline, and patience in achieving success. The speaker encourages people to have the right mindset and to be willing to learn, work hard, and be patient in building wealth. He also highlights the importance of ignoring the financial side and believing in oneself to achieve any goal, whether it is becoming a singer, actor, entrepreneur, or CEO. The speaker gives examples of talented people who lacked drive and work ethic, which limited their success, and average singers who produced content regularly and improved, which led to their success."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNvYcliMMnI_sep_1190_1434,sNvYcliMMnI_sep_1190_1434,"So today, we're in an environment where it's the first time in a long time that we have inflation going up. I mean, I had inflation when I was a kid, but this is the first time in my professional career that I'm dealing with rising costs of food and fuel. And we're starting to see, you know, it's not a recession yet, but we're starting to see layoffs happening. It's still a far, far away from levels of ending a recession and seeing like a recovery in the financial markets. But it's been a rocky start to 2022 for the stock market. People are worried about losing jobs. How can they see opportunity and manage their perceptions in this environment? Well, great question. You know, I'm going to do a roundabout on this answer, if you don't mind. I was speaking at a church, and I can't say I get to speak at churches all the time, but they invited me to speak at this church. And I made a statement which shocked people, made everybody just stop. And I made a statement. I said, if you're impoverished or poor, it's because you're probably not caring about humanity. And ooh, that was a really interesting response I got. I said, because if you really care about humanity, you will be on the cutting edge of finding out what humanity is looking for. You'll be wanting to keep current with what the needs are in the people you want to serve. And they change. And if you're not willing to be adaptable and change with them, you can be left behind. So if you really care, you're keeping and you have a value on it, you'll be incrementally adapting to changes in the market as they start to emerge. And you'll be actually having foresight about what that is and anticipating it and preparing for it. And if you don't care, you'll be in your amygdala and you'll wait and you'll learn through what is called trial and error, either learn through foresight or hindsight. And if you're not really inspired to build wealth and to serve people and grow your finances, you're probably going to go, oops, and then react and hold on to your thing and wait and hope it comes back to the way it was before. And sort of face the reality that it's changing and the world is constantly changing. It's eternal change. Prometheus described this and emphatically as the Greek philosopher said the same thing back then, his times. And the same thing for Heraclitus. So the key to adapt is to have foresight enough to look at where is the current market and what are the downsides. I mean, it wasn't hard to see that the margin rates are high. It's over the mean in the overall general market. They're spending ridiculous amounts of money on social, you know, rescues. And you're going to pay a price with inflation that's just inevitable. So it's not like we didn't see all those coming. So the question is, if you're really caring about serving people and building your wealth, so you're not in dire straits, you're going to be thinking, okay, what happens when all of a sudden we print out money and inflation begins? What are the markets that go up and down and where do we need to position ourselves and how do we need to adapt? And who are the people that are going to be needing service? And what are the strategies I anticipate? People who really, really are caring about other human beings are going to be anticipating that and looking at those trends, looking for those things. And those people are usually also realizing that if the market goes down, they know to have a cash reserve,",The discussion highlights the current economic environment where inflation is on the rise and layoffs are happening. It emphasizes the importance of being adaptable and having foresight in managing finances during changing times. The speaker suggests that those who care about serving people and building wealth will be proactive in identifying market trends and anticipating changes to position themselves for success. It is important to have a cash reserve and to be mindful of market fluctuations to avoid dire financial straits.
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNvYcliMMnI_sep_1435_1735,sNvYcliMMnI_sep_1435_1735,"I'm amazed at how people think that they can go by without cash reserves. I mean, they're sitting on empty all the time. And it's, I'm a firm believer of having at least six months to a year's worth of cash reserves at all times. Even if inflation erodes some of it, I still have cash reserves because it buys me the ability to adapt. And it also allows me to get crashes and grab markets and allows me also to not be emotional and more strategic with more foresight and not hindsight. So that's just a basic lesson that some people don't learn until after these type of events occur. And then they know, Oh, I'm going to make sure I have cash reserves to weather the storm. And I looked at the Fortune 100 companies, nothing, nothing under 40% cash reserves for the year. Most of them have up to 50, 60 or up higher percent. Even Microsoft has sometimes a hundred percent cash reserve for the year. So I'm a firm believer of you can have foresight, you can prepare for those things and anticipate the things. And the writing was on the wall. There's no way that when you start seeing the stock market going up at this angle, instead of, you know, seven to nine or 10% angle, you know, you've got an acceleration phase and you know, that's just a matter of time. And when you see margin accounts going up and price earnings getting pretty high, 20s, 30s, 40s, 90 in Tesla, 5,000 in Tesla, you know, when you see these kinds of things, you know, you've got emotional exuberance. You don't have intrinsic value that we're looking at. We're looking at things that are exaggerated. So you know that those are signs. So you want to make sure you build cash reserves, make sure you think about what happens when the market goes down and inflation comes up. What are things that, what is the historical pattern of people that are during inflation? What do they buy? What do they hold back on? You know, then you change your direction accordingly and make sure you're prepared for selling things and marketing in those directions and investing in those new directions. That's what, that's the welcome to the way it's called foresight, intelligent people who think ahead and not so intelligent people think from behind. And we can't forget that there's a cyclicality to the economy, the world that we live in and even our lives, there tends to be cycles. There are up cycles, there are down cycles. That's, that's the reality of life. So if we can plan and think strategically, you hope to take advantage of those times. Exactly. Well, I'm a firm believer. You know, one of the guys that helped me along the financial general was Charles Ellis. You know, he wrote a book called Winning the Losers Game. And he was a statistician, right? He did. He took care of the stats. And I remember reading a book called Investment Legends, and there was like 20 investment legends and 20 of them out of 20 investment legends, they kept referring to this guy. So I said, well, this guy must be somebody that they keep referring to. So I studied everything he had and watched all the videos I could find on this guy. And you know, he understood the cycles. He knew the credit cycles as they're called and the overall productivity cycle as D'Aleo describes. And these are patterns within seven to 12 year patterns. You know, they could be eight, nine, 10 years, maybe more, maybe less, but there, there's cycles. And there are phases of the cycle that you can see. You may not nail it exactly within the week or month, but, or even the quarter, but you can definitely nail it's coming and you can be preparing for it. I look at the overall mean of the market. And whenever I see it going above the market, I know I get a higher percentage of cash reserves. And then when it goes below, I put a higher percent of back, back in. I mean, it's, I just do that little extra thing on top of buying, net buying into the market. And it gives me an extra couple percent. And I'm very grateful for that. And many people get exuberant when it's up and then expect double digit returns forever. And they don't understand that that's, they have to understand what the real mean is, what the GDP ratio to the mean is of the markets that they're investing in, and be real. A lot of people get fantasies and then they get nightmares, because they're holding onto, you know, get rich quick kind of mentality instead of long-term planning. And that's long-term plan. I always say that money is nothing more than a by-product of deferred gratification and longer-term patience and using compound interest, the eighth one to the world. So you do adjust. It's the fifth decade that's mind blowing with compound interest. I just finished four decades. This decade is going to be the most unique one because this is when, you know, you will probably have a flat period for awhile. And you know, there's all kinds of things that might happen from after inflation, but, but eventually it's going to go back up again. And when it goes back up again, that fifth decade is pretty amazing. You just ride the storms. And if you don't have capital, you don't have liquid capital, you're going to be emotional and you're going to sell things to get cash, because you didn't do cash reserves.","The discussion revolves around the importance of cash reserves in finance. The speaker highlights the significance of having at least six months to a year's worth of cash reserves, even if inflation erodes some of it. The speaker suggests that cash reserves offer the ability to adapt, grab market crashes, and be strategic with foresight. The speaker further emphasizes that cyclicality is a reality of life, and it is crucial to plan and think strategically to take advantage of up and down cycles. The discussion highlights the importance of understanding credit and productivity cycles and nailing phases of the cycle that one can prepare for. The speaker also suggests that having a higher percentage of cash reserves when the market is above the mean and putting back more money when it is below the mean is an effective strategy. Finally, the speaker mentions the significance of deferred gratification, longer-term patience, and using compound interest to accumulate wealth."

You always want to think of the worst case scenario and have a cash reserve for it. So you never think I learned that from Buffett many years ago in the 80s, you know, keep good cash reserves. So you have plenty of time to adapt and you take advantage of the crashes. Well, to your credit, I think that my industry, the financial services industry, too often does not encourage investors to have cash reserves, you always hear phrases like you have to stay fully invested, you have to weather the storm. But if you look at Warren Buffett, there are times when he's sitting on billions of dollars of cash. 140 billion. People don't believe how much cash he's sitting on. And he waits for the right time. And because he's Warren Buffett, he he gets access to deals. If we look back at 2008, when all the big banks got in trouble, he was getting very unique deals from Goldman Sachs to infuse them with cash that they needed. You know, he got special warrants just for Warren. Yeah. Well, he you can't lose on the on the futures of those warrants. In those moments, you know, you know, it's going up. So it's just a matter of he doesn't normally do a derivative like that. He'll, he'll do it when he sees an obvious win. And why not? But but Munger, there's a great little video on Munger, the something he learned about investing that was really good. He called it the locker room mentality of Wall Street. You know, a lot of them are they got to win and there's got to be a win loss instead of a win win. And I'm a firm believer that, as I said on the probably on the first show is, is that unless there's a sustainable fair exchange between you, the employees, the customers, the stockholders, everybody's going to win, it's not going to be sustainable. You don't have a win lose. So trying to win at the expense of other people is a narcissistic thing that will eventually bring hubris. So I don't waste my time on that. I don't even, I don't even think like that. And I don't, I make sure that I have enough value on my wealth that I buy things that I feel are pretty confident to give me a return. You know, I bought a peanut butter company that I used to eat as a child. The company had been out more, it was already in operation before I was born. And I guarantee it's still going to be an operation when I depart. And I bought that and it's now held for nearly 40 years. And it's given me a great return, about an 8.5% return with the thing. And I'm grateful. And I know that people are going to be eating peanut butter in the future. You know, I ask people, how many of you eat peanut butter at some point in your life? And everybody's got their hands up. I said, so I just bought a company that serves people. And I'm grateful that I did. And it has been a consistent and even when the downturns people eat more peanut butter. Peanut butter goes up. So it's like I can't learn it. And so I learned that, you know, Mary Buffett, I had the opportunity to lecture sometimes alongside her and sometimes she got sick and I had to take her place and stuff. You know, she was there with, and learned a lot from Warren too. And she has some great little books out there. One of them is on the financial statements. And it's a great way of, it's discerning about, you know, what stocks to be buying. And she's got some criteria there. They're really, really simple, common sense stuff. You know, what's the probability of this company being there in the future? Or is this one of those quick fix things and get out and it's over with? You know, is this a quick thing that burns out and it's just off the rockets and then disappears? Or is this something that's going to be serving people long-term? And I'm a slow conservative investor. I'm not interested in making, you know, quick and rich. I found that that starts the amygdala running and it gets people into trouble and it gets people into wanting to beat that market again and try to, you know, it gets them, it gets them off center. And I think that's why Munger and some of his philosophy is something where, you know, people could benefit from learning from, cause he's a, he's a patient guy and he understands that. And I think patience pays off. I'm not probably the biggest and greatest investor. You know, I bought indices and net bought and never sold them and rode out their cycles and put more in when it was down and a bit less when it was up, just I'm moderated just a bit. And I've been able to get about a double digit return and I can't complain. I'm not interested in getting a hundred percent or crypto, you know, get 70% in a week, you know, none of that. I'm interested in serving clients and not being distracted by emotions of making things, of making things, of making things, of making things, of making things.","The discussion is about the importance of having cash reserves in finance. While many in the financial services industry encourage investors to stay fully invested and weather the storm, successful investors like Warren Buffett often have billions of dollars in cash reserves to take advantage of market crashes and unique deals. The importance of patience, sustainability, and fair exchange is emphasized, rather than a ""win-lose"" mentality that can lead to hubris. The speaker also discusses their own investing strategy of slow and conservative investing, focusing on sustainable companies that serve people long-term, rather than quick fixes that burn out. They recommend learning from the patient and conservative philosophy of Charlie Munger, and caution against being distracted by emotions and quick riches."

And I got to be interviewed. He liked me on there for some reason. I was, you know, I was in probably 30s, early 30s, 29, 30 years old at the time. And I'd just been investing a few years, but for some reason he liked what I had to say. And he said something and I said something on the air one time that just went kind of bonkers. If you're excited, you're probably screwed up. And if it's boring, you're probably on track. And then people were like, you know what's interesting? I really believe that investing is so simple that a lot of people who are in the investment world don't want people to know that. And so they have to make it complex to justify their position. But I think it's really simple. I've had, I must say thousands of people now, I've initiated them to get into, you know, consistent investing and simplified it and showed them how to get started into it in about 20 minutes. It's so simple. It doesn't have to be complex, but I, and I'm the one that has been blessed today. You know, I can't complain about my life. I used to live on the streets, as you know. So I'm going to say, if you're grateful for what you have, you get more to be grateful for. And if you manage money wisely, you get more money to manage. And if you defer gratification, you get great rewards in the long run and you crescendo, not decrescendo.","The discussion touches on the speaker's experience in finance and investing, which they believe is often made needlessly complex by those in the investment world.

Well, I think first you you start with one of the most important things that you're closest to, like, is it your business? First, calculate how many days, weeks, months or years you can live on your saving, because when you do that, you'll start to you'll gain security, you'll gain that. OK, so look at how much you're spending. OK, and then say, how much do I need? And whatever that number is, you're going to need more than that. Because it may go down rather than go up. So, OK, now, do I have a year's spending? OK, so I think I think you you start there. Then you start to think, what are the things that are most important for me? Like, and then you start with your your business or your residents that have a symbiotic relationship and that you know well. Let's say if you start with your business. OK, you're closer to that investing in yourself with whatever that may end up being. Not real estate, not stocks, not the market.

So when you're enjoying it and you're controlling it and it's yours and so on, you're going to have to do something about it. And if you're controlling it and it's yours and so on, that's that's pretty good. And if you know, if they keep mortgage tax deductions and so on, you know, there might be some benefits to it also. OK. But that's not a black and white answer. You know, so you could take a short pencil and say, is it better to rent or buy? OK, that's a different question. Maybe yes. But by and large, am I going to move, you know, all of those other questions? So you start with, OK, what is it that's close to home and how much you need? A certain amount that's liquid. In other words, you got it in your house. You got to make a mortgage payment or something. And all of a sudden, you're, you know, it's not liquid and you lose your job. Well, that can cause you trouble. So how much do I have that's liquid? How much do I have that's not liquid? OK. And you start to get those things right. Oh, I've got enough liquid. I got enough. OK. Not liquid in those other things. OK. Pretty soon you're you're getting yourself in good shape. Yeah, you do those things. You know, you're pretty much in good shape. And then you're also having some experiences and then you go beyond that. You know, and then so you start to OK. What you know, OK, what's a stock, what's a bond? And then, you know, you learn through experiences. I learned through my my experiences. I started when I was a kid, 12. I used to caddy and I took my caddying money and I put it in the stock market. And I was lucky in what happened to me, by the way, is I took my caddying money and I bought the only company that I ever heard of that was selling for less than five dollars a share. And I thought that that, you know, well, I was really dumb. I thought I'll buy more shares of it goes up, I'll make more money.

What would you say then are the three greatest skills that people that aren't financially abundant or that are struggling financially? Should learn to master in order to be in a better position financially three skills. What would you say they should learn? Well, as I said before, I remember watching the movie. I was young, David Copperfield with W.C. Fields, and he speaks to David Copperfield. And he says he said something like, and I'll put it in dollar terms, you're in one hundred dollars and you spend one hundred and five dollars. That's misery. If you earn one hundred dollars and you spend ninety five dollars, you'll have a good life. I mean, it wasn't exactly like that, but it was. But basically, I know so many people who don't earn much, but are there because if you start to think about what it is that it costs you to live in terms of, let's say, the basics, you know, give me a bed to sleep and give me the food, let me be educated and so on and so forth. I think most people can get themselves in a position where, you know, they're net positive. So if you can be net positive and you could do that, that, you know, that's number one, you know, as I carry that. So that's, you know, that's number one. Then I guess it was the list that we went to. You know, the second is, you know, what do you do next in terms of what do you need? What do you invest in? You know, and then and then, you know, going beyond it. And then there avoid the following mistake, the most common mistake of investing, thinking that the investment that did good is a good investment. People rather more expensive. The things that quite often. Those markets that did really, really well became more expensive and everybody smart money is all the time compete, comparing them and competing. So what happens is the naive money buys the thing that was hot. Or is hot the thing that has been terrible, which might be the thing that's beaten down. So I would say also an important element. OK, so here's another one that's really important. Diversify. So don't put all your eggs in one basket. Right. Because what I learned about this. Is that, first of all, all investments compete and it's not easy to sell, tell whether one investment is better than the other. Because if people could do that, life would be easy and everybody make a ton of money. So and this is a competitive game that's very difficult to compete in. So it's very difficult to say which one's better or worse. You could take experts and you could do all sorts of tests and you'll find out that they can pick that and you can't tell whether the worst ones are going to be better. So because of that, you understand that even picking the best ones is difficult. And particularly if you're naive, like we spend hundreds of millions of dollars each year on research to try to give us an edge. OK, now you've got to compete with us. So competing in the markets is more difficult than competing in the Olympics. You wouldn't think I'm going to compete in the Olympics, but there are more people who try harder in order to do that. So it's a zero sum game. So but diversification. That they're different will reduce your risk without reducing your return. Yeah. So if you know how to diversify well, so that's critical. So I would say again, get get your savings right. And the reasons I say I would say have great humility about what you what you don't know. Don't buy the thing that was hot. Just because you think it's hot and then know how to diversify well that those would be the most important things I could I could I could I could I could I could I could I could I could I could I could I could I could.","The discussion is about the three most important financial skills for people who are struggling financially. The first skill is to learn how to live within your means, spending less than you earn. The second skill is to avoid common investment mistakes, such as investing in expensive markets and buying investments just because they are popular. The third skill is to diversify your investments in order to reduce risk without reducing returns. It is important to have humility about what you don't know and to avoid buying things just because they are hot."

But what types of conversations should we be having to shift the narrative around money? So we can start attracting it in our favor as opposed to rejecting it Well, first of all, we need to teach it in high school. Luckily here in Florida It's been put into the curriculum and I'm very proud of that You know, I used to be in the educational software business as a hundred and ten thousand school buildings in America Majority of them in New York and Florida, Texas and California and abysmally most of them don't teach even debt They don't even teach how to use a credit card, which is ridiculous. We've got to change that and luckily we are We're starting to see it creep into the curriculums in all the major states, which is good But I think parents have a responsibility to talk about money, which is always sitting at the table every day It always is and you know getting their kids to understand how a credit card works is very important And again, I talked about not entitling that's important too, but within within your friends I mean don't be embarrassed to talk about money. You're gonna be talking about money for the rest of your life It's always gonna be part you can't live without it. You have to deal with it It can cause great joy and give you personal freedom or can be Catastrophic in your life destroy your happiness completely your choice is where does it fit? Do you want it to destroy your life or would you prefer? That you understand how it works and respect it for what it is and deal with it That's a personal choice people have to make and I would say the best way to do that is learn more talk more about it Don't be afraid to discuss it. I don't care what age you're at, but certainly at the age of 16 You should be discussing that and above all Taking 10% of whatever anybody gives you your grandmother your birthday gift Whatever it is and set it aside and start investing it the earlier you start the less pressure you have when you're in your 60s And do you think someone in their late 40s and 50s? Do you think it's too late for them to start learning about financial literacy if they've? Struggled in their 20s and 30s and 40s. Do you think it's too late to start investing and saving? What should people do in their 40s and early 50s? No, they should at any age. I mean the truth is Changing your spending behavior in your 40s is difficult But you can do it and at that age you should start Saving 20 to 25 percent of what you're taking in which sounds hard to do but it isn't You just stop buying those five dollar coffees and you stop buying stuff You don't use anybody can go look in their closet and see all the crap They bought that they never used and basically you killed that money when you did that you bought something that you could have had Invested and it could have grown six percent eight percent a year for you But instead you bought some piece of junk that you're throwing out now. Everybody's guilty of that I actually think my mother was right. She's always said that people can save 20% They just don't have the backbone to do it and she did and she died a very wealthy woman She had a secret account She kept them both of her husbands and I was the older brother and was executor for the state and I remember the lawyers calling Me up saying you got to come down here your mother you met your mother had a lot of money And I always wondered how she did it She basically bought dividend paying stocks in her 20s and a whole bunch of telco bonds 50-50 Portfolio she loved telco bonds They used to yield 6% in those days and she loved dividend paying stocks S&P stocks and over the 50 years that she had this account It just provided massive appreciation","The discussion is about the importance of financial literacy and the need to teach it in schools. The speaker highlights that many schools in America do not teach even the basics of finance, such as debt and credit cards. The responsibility also falls on parents to teach their children about money and credit. The speaker encourages people to talk more openly about money and not be afraid to discuss it with friends and family. It is never too late to start investing and saving, even in one's 40s and 50s. The speaker suggests saving 20 to 25 percent of one's income by changing spending behavior and investing in dividend-paying stocks and bonds. The speaker shares the story of their mother, who saved and invested early in her life and became wealthy by investing in telco bonds and S&P stocks."

And what would you say are a couple of qualities that you really look for when you're looking to invest in someone or when someone has an idea and whether you invest them or not, you're like this person's going to be successful, whether it's in this thing or something else. What are those two or three qualities that all of them seem to have in your mind, whether it be a leadership skill or clarity? What would that be? I prefer to invest in entrepreneurs that have failed once or twice before, that have felt the sting of failure and have gone down the road and not had success the first time because their motivations are completely different than a more arrogant first-timer that thinks everything they do is going to make a hundred million dollars. It's just not, doesn't work that way. And so that's one thing. I love, there's three things you have to have the ability to do and know if you're going to be successful in business. Number one is you have to be able to articulate your idea 90 seconds or less. It explains to me why anybody would want that product to service. And if you take more than a minute and a half, you're never going to be successful. You're just not. And number two is you have to be able to explain why you're the right person to execute on that idea. In other words, what is it about you that knows how to take this idea, which good ideas are dime a dozen, execution skills are really hard to find. So what is it about you that can execute on this business and make it work? I mean those two together start to be really interesting because then as an investor looks at it says, well I'm going to mitigate my risk. I've got a great executional expert here and I've got a great idea. And then lastly, the one that I think you have to have a good command of, you have to know your numbers. You have to be able to explain gross margins, market share, break-even analysis, how many competitors, how fast can you grow. Those are the three things that define success. And I think, you know, that's who I want to invest in. Someone who has a command of all three of those, that's probably got more than a 50% chance of being successful if they can do that right. And how does someone develop a rich mindset if they've always been told that, you know, people with money are bad or money makes you evil or whatever people have heard when they're growing up? How does someone shift out of that and start seeing money in a different light, in a positive light, in a powerful light, in their benefit and in an abundance mindset as well? How do we shift that if we've always been conditioned otherwise? Yeah, but I mean, you have to understand why, you know, why a third of the population seeks entrepreneurship. It's not out of the greed of money. It's the pursuit of personal freedom. In America, what sets you free is to have enough financial resources to spend your day doing things that you want to do. It's one of the greatest freedoms you can have. And what I learned about it, you know, when I had my first liquidity event, I was young and we sold the learning company for four point two billion dollars. There were ten of us who were founders. So what I found so amazing is everybody showed up the next day after we closed right back at their desks because they didn't know anything else. That's what they wanted to do. They wanted to work. And what I found in life is I work harder today than I've ever have and I don't need to, but I still want to. And this is what I know. And so the whole idea that I don't have to do something, you know, I work with Nancy Chung, who sort of manages my day and I block it off into 30 minute things that each week, you know, maybe on on Saturday morning or something we review the next week. And I look at all the things that are in book. And if I see something I don't want to do, I just say, take it off. I'm not doing it. And there's nothing anybody can do about that. That is my ability to be free, to choose the things that mean something to me and avoid the ones that don't. Because my most valuable asset at this point is my time. That's what I care about. And I wish that for everybody. That's my whole point. But something about money you should understand and everybody should think about is the danger of money in a family is entitlement. If you entitle somebody and you de-risk their future, you have actually cursed them. You've cursed them. You have almost guaranteed that they will fail, that they will never launch. I experienced this myself when I was graduating from college undergrad and my mother came to that again. She was a big influence in my life from events like this. And she said to me, great news is I'm coming to the graduation, but I I want you to know the dead bird under the nest never learned how to fly. And I said, Mom, what the hell does that mean? She said, there's no more checks. I've paid from birth to last day of college. That's my deal. And you get nothing else from me. And I went, wow, like I don't have a job. I can't even pay my rent. And like she said, you're gonna have to work it out. I mean, look, I've done my job and now you're gonna have to learn how to fly. And I had a tough couple of years. But what she what she was really saying was she hated entitlement and she didn't want to entitle me and I had to go figure it out. It was very tough. And years later, you know, I always look at these things that you these moments you learn something and then you apply them later because they've they've you know, they've they've steeped, they've aged in your head. They've they've actually come, you know, it's like a wine. It's it's it's aged to a perfect fit.","The investor prefers entrepreneurs who have experienced failure and have a clear idea that can be explained in 90 seconds or less. They must also be able to articulate why they are the right person to execute the idea and have a good command of their numbers. The pursuit of personal freedom, not greed, motivates entrepreneurship. Money provides the freedom to do what you want, but it can also lead to entitlement and curse future success. The investor learned the value of hard work and independence when his mother stopped supporting him financially after college."

I set up generational skipping trusts that did exactly that. They took from any child, from birth to last day of college, and any degree. They could go right to a PhD if they wanted. They could stay in school their whole lives if they wanted, and the trust would pay for them, long after I'm gone. But after they graduate, nothing, zero. And I said that to my kids, and they were four and six. They just laughed at me. And then later in Boston, when my son was in high school doing really poorly, not applying himself, one day, I guess he had talked to one of his friends in his class, was telling him all about his family trust and all that stuff. I don't know why he brought this up, but my bet is that's what happened. He said to me, Dad, walk me through the trust that, my trust. I said, sure. Mom and I are going out to dinner. If we get run over by a bus, you don't have to worry. You're going to get to finish high school. But it doesn't look like you're going to get to college because your marks are terrible. And then he said, well, OK, then what happens? I said, well, I'm dead and you have no money. Oh, man. Wake up call. Yeah, well, that was the wake up call. And it may sound cruel and people may say that's terrible. Today, he has started his first week as a full time engineer at Tesla after you know, going through the whole system and graduating as an engineer. I paid for the whole thing. But now he's on his own. And but I think the wake up call motivated him. That's the whole idea of entitlement. If he thought he didn't have to do anything, maybe he wouldn't have taken that path. How many rich kids screwed up rich kids? Do you know plenty? There's lots of them. They're entitled. I'll never be. And they may not like me for doing what I did to them. But if they have children, the trust pays for them. And those are expensive and I'll be gone. But that's what's","The speaker set up generational skipping trusts that pay for his children's education up until the last day of college, including a PhD if they want. After graduation, however, there would be no financial support. His son initially laughed at the idea, but later came to appreciate it when he was struggling in high school and asked his father to explain the trust. This was a wake-up call for his son, who later became a successful engineer at Tesla. The speaker believes that entitlement can be detrimental to children and that motivating them through financial responsibility is important. The trust will continue to pay for future generations' education."

Maybe they wouldn't ask you for the advice, but what would you give them on how to raise better kids who have all the money in the world to their disposal? Don't give it to them. Don't let them think that they are de-risked. Don't let them think they're entitled. They will act differently. They will take a different path. They will focus on their own lives and try and achieve things on their own. There's no reason you can't support them and you can't help with them in emergencies like medical emergencies or whatever it is. But if you entitle them that they never have to work, you've cursed them. You've cursed them. You've totally written them off in terms of people that could have achieved greatness because they were motivated to do so for reasons that everybody in the world has. You have to find your own path. Like that's the whole idea. If you're granted a free pass, you've wasted a whole lifetime. That's my view. Look, not everybody agrees, but look, this is the way we run our family and so far so good. And you know, the one thing that I think we failed as a society on, because you're getting into an area that I spent a lot of time on here, is financial literacy. We have failed an entire generation. There's a hundred million people in America that have, and some of them are in their 60s, that have nothing set aside for their retirement. They never were taught how to invest. There's a big difference between saving and investing. A savings account gives you nothing now. Interest rates are basically zero. The markets give you six to eight percent a year, but you've got to learn how to harness them. Nobody teaches those kids anything. And that's like, it's a good segue into something I want to talk to you about called Bean Stocks, which is, you know, a big initiative for me to build a robo that invests like I do. And like my mother did, a really conservative robo that you can download and actually tries to help you do this without you understanding how to buy and sell stocks. So let's talk about that for a minute. Yeah. Well, what is it? How do we get it? So you download it off any phone, on any app store, and the whole idea, here's what I learned. The first time I took a stab at this, I assumed that everybody knew how to buy a stock and sell it and how to build a diverse portfolio. I was 100% wrong. I brought out an incredibly sophisticated product, but 99% of people don't actually invest directly themselves. Some massive percentage of the population don't do that. They either have an advisor or they don't have an advisor because they don't have a lot of money. And so we ignore them. If somebody only has $400 to put aside a month, generally the financial services industry ignores them because they can't make any money off them. And that's 100 million people. So I helped a whole team develop Bean Stocks. And there's a zillion different robos on the market. And I think anything that helps you invest is great. But I couldn't find anything that invested with my personal philosophy. And so I really wanted something that was about value, about getting paid dividends, so get paid to wait, conservative in nature and above all, diverse. And so I like to use exchange traded funds. I use that in my own family trust. And that's what we built Bean Stocks around. So the whole idea is that you put aside $100 a week. And if you're in your early 20s and you do this, you find the discipline. It's about $100 a side a week. And that's the hardest part, by the way, because there's always some piece of crap you want to buy that you don't need. But you put it into Bean Stocks and it automatically diversifies it into a portfolio designed specifically for you when you set it up. And so you can put projects that you want to maybe want to buy a car or house. It helps you do that. It helps you just diversify into a wide range of ETFs. And just it's a place where you build a nest egg. That's the whole idea. Now, it doesn't mean you can't day trade. You can have a Robinhood account. You can do whatever you like. You can do an online broker, whatever. But this is for the part that you're putting aside for yourself for the future when you turn 65, which might be 10% of your paycheck or 10% of your winnings. And if you're a day trader, but it's completely different. It's not day trading. It's a day trading. It's a day trading.","The discussion touches on the topic of raising financially responsible kids. The speaker advises against giving children unlimited access to money and creating a sense of entitlement. They stress the importance of financial literacy, which is lacking in society, and the need to teach kids how to invest and save for their future. The speaker also introduces their initiative called Bean Stocks, a conservative robo-advisor app that helps people invest in a diverse portfolio of exchange-traded funds. The app is aimed at the 100 million people who are generally ignored by the financial services industry because they have limited funds to invest. The speaker believes that Bean Stocks can help people develop the discipline to put aside money and build a nest egg for their future."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNJhP_zgc7A_sep_1983_2217,UNJhP_zgc7A_sep_1983_2217,"What I do with my financial system is I set a target each year. This is how much money I'm going to save and invest. And those numbers are aggressive. That's a lot of money. You're going hard. Yeah, like every year. So like 10%, 30%. Yeah, so anywhere between those ranges. And we have folks who- Of what you earn. Correct. Yeah. And then remember, whenever I make any unexpected income, let's say I did a speaking gig or something. Yeah. Yeah, I might get myself some, I might go out to dinner, but the rest I'm just putting straight in investments. Wow. So that money grows aggressively. And I also want to remind everybody, especially the entrepreneurs watching, I know you have a lot of entrepreneurs. You wouldn't believe how many entrepreneur friends I know who have a good business and they don't invest at all. And that's a huge mistake. What should you be investing in if you have a good business? Simple, low cost target date funds is a great way to go. Entrepreneurs- Is that index funds? Yeah, index funds. They get a little too smart for their own good. They say, I could just put that money in my business. And I always say, look, I'm glad you have a business that's throwing off tons of cash. That's awesome. Most businesses don't last 80 years. So be smart. Give yourself a small plan B. Put 5K a month, 10K a month, whatever's appropriate for your level of success. And hey, maybe your business does really well. That's awesome. But maybe one day something goes wrong. Always want to be prepared. You never want to have your back against the wall. So I just want to encourage everybody, whether you're making 250K or 2.5 million for the high earners here, don't get too smart for your own good. Keep investing and saving. What are the three or four main things you invest in with that 10 to 30% a year? And does it change year to year? Yeah. I'll kind of walk you through for the high earners and then we can talk about people 100K and less. So once you have a certain amount of capital, you do have a few opportunities that you probably didn't have before. Everybody has this idea that the rich have all these crazy tax breaks and captive insurance and this and that. And I've looked into all that stuff. I know about insurance companies and all these other things. Yeah. Yeah. Here's the truth. The truth is, it's a little sketchy, but yeah, definitely. And I'll say my core values are that when it comes to things like taxes, I love your principle on this. I'm very conservative. I'm like, dude, only in this country could I have been this successful. I love this mindset. I'm happy to pay my taxes. It means that I had the opportunity to create something great. And if I pay an extra 5,000 or 30,000, it doesn't change my life at all. And I want to be able to give back to the society that enabled me to do what I do. That's powerful mindset. And it gets you away from, you still want to optimize tax breaks that are out there, but it gets you away from trying to constantly look for some of the shortcuts or like schemes or something. Yes. I've always found that the people, especially entrepreneurs who talk about tax breaks all the time are typically the most unsuccessful ones. Two reasons. One, why are you talking about tax breaks instead of growing your business? And two, it's a very scarcity driven mindset. Oh, I only have this much that I have to protect when really you can just grow the pie and your taxes are simply a proportion. Just make more. Now, yes, you do want to optimize and take advantage of all legal tax breaks. So as you earn more, you do have more opportunities. You have not only your 401k, you have all kinds of advanced IRA options. You have HSAs. You have a variety of things. But at a certain point, if you're making enough, you're going to max all of those out. So what do you do when you max it all out? So then the next step is to simply create a taxable account. It's just a typical non-retirement account and you just continue to invest. So that's one. And that's going to keep making you money over the long term. It's just, you're not going to get those tax breaks from a 401k and IRA, et cetera. So the other thing is, as you accumulate more and more assets, you're going to start to notice a lot of different people are going to come in and come in and come in...","The discussion is about personal finance and investing. The speaker sets aggressive savings and investment targets each year, anywhere between 10% to 30% of their income. They also invest unexpected income in index funds to grow their money aggressively. The speaker encourages entrepreneurs to invest in low-cost target date funds and not rely solely on their business for financial security. The speaker advises high earners to optimize legal tax breaks and invest in advanced IRA options, HSAs, and taxable accounts once they max out their retirement accounts. Finally, as they accumulate more assets, they need to be aware of various investment opportunities and be cautious of people who might try to take advantage of them."

I could burn my cash easier. But you're gonna want, as you start to accumulate a lot, you're gonna wanna do, have a little fun with your money when it comes to investing. So some people wanna do crypto. I think a lot of these people are complete nut jobs. Okay, look you crypto. I put a little bit in there just to like have fun, but I was like, thank goodness I didn't put more in there because everyone's losing their money. Exactly, and they're, you know, they're all, okay, I don't even wanna get into crypto because I'm gonna get a lot of angry emails. Hey, if you wanna email me about your angry crypto opinions, just send it to trash at Iwillteachyoutoberich.com. Don't send it to me. But you know what, I like what you said. You took a little bit, you had some fun. Yeah, I had some fun. Five to 10%, once you've got all your other stuff automated, you've got your index funds locked down, HSA, your different accounts, I don't have any problem. I think you should take five to 10% and you should have some fun with it. For me, I did angel investing and I basically learned that I suck. Yeah, me too. My angel investing's not good. I haven't made any money from investment. Yeah, my deal flow sucks. My choices were okay. Some hit, most didn't. Basically just wrote that money off. But it was fun and it allowed me to have an outlet. And you learned. I learned. And you got to meet people and yeah. Yeah, so if you wanna do crypto, if you wanna invest in somebody's bar, you wanna do angel investing if you're qualified, et cetera, be my guest, but don't jump to that first. Get all your stuff automated. And at a certain point, the compounding is so insane. You will start to actually earn more from your investments than you will from your income, even if you're making 500K a year. From the index funds you're talking about if you're investing in that. What if the market's going down or up? Should you even worry about that? Let's say you put a half a million in. It went up 100,000 over a couple years, but then it went back to the original investment. Should you be like, oh my gosh, I need to take this out? Do not do that. I'll give you a real example. I just put two years of my money into this and it's still the same amount. Should've just left it in the bank. No, you shouldn't have left it in the bank. All right, so this happened to me just about two weeks ago. So the market went down and I hardly ever log. I log in about once a month to my investments. Just to see like, oh, yeah. And really you should not be checking your investments. Check every 10 years. Once a month is good and you're not a day trader. Okay, so I happened to log in and I saw that in the 11 days of that month, in one of my accounts I had lost $75,000. Okay, so for everybody listening, yeah. How would you react if you lost $75,000 in 11 days? Most people would be freaked out. They'd be freaked out. They would pull their money out. Yeah, which is exactly the opposite of what you should do. So everyone says this common thing and they just roll their eyes. Oh, buy low, sell high. But in reality, they actually buy high and sell low. Do you know what I did? I did nothing. I logged in, I felt no emotion. It wasn't like my life is over. It was like watching someone offer me concrete to eat. Like I felt nothing. I'm like, nah, that's fine, whatever. I just closed the window. The key there is every month, my system is automatically investing. It's called dollar cost averaging. It's just automatically investing. And you should set the same thing up too. You shouldn't be paying attention manually. You shouldn't be sending a check. It just works automatically. And so I knew this month, the market is down. And if you think about any other thing you buy, if the price of toothpaste goes down, you're happy. If the price of milk goes down, you're happy. The only time we get weird is when the price of the market goes down and then we're like, oh, let me pull all my money out. Bad move. The price went down. If you're young and you have a long time before you need the money, you're getting the market at a discount. You should get excited. You should get excited. So I just said, great, it went down fine. Doesn't bother me. And I just closed the window. And a few days later, my system will just purchase it again. So it's up, it's down. It doesn't matter in the short term. But over the long term, we know that the market tends to return about seven to 8% over time. But it can go up, it can go down. And so you do not want to be paying attention in the short term. Let's say you've got a half a million to a million dollars, extra cash laying around. You've maxed out all your IRAs. You've got five to 10 grand a month going to your index funds. You've dabbled in the smaller investments and startups and you've done it all. Got a little bit of crypto. You've tried everything. What should you do with that extra million dollars a year? Okay, great question. First off, this is like somebody saying to a fitness instructor, I've done everything. What should I do next? And you know what that fitness instructor is gonna say? They're gonna say, when you say everything, what do you really mean? Like show me, are you doing foam rolling? Are you doing this? Are you all balanced? For the person who's doing this, I'm gonna give you your answer, but I'm gonna first say, are you sure? Have you planned out so you know that 10 years from now, you're gonna buy a house? Do you have a 20% down payment set aside? I do and I have no plans to buy a house anytime soon, but I have 20% set aside for a house. For that moment, yeah. Yeah, so I already plan for what I know is coming, even though I have no interest in it today. What about the first year of your kid's life? Do you have that set aside? What about X, Y, Z? Are you taking care of your parents when they get older? One thing that I really love to do is talk about relationships. So I love to invite my family once a year for a big, big vacation where we can all stay in a house.","The discussion is about investing and having fun with money. The speaker advises automating all investment accounts, setting up an HSA, and having index funds before considering having fun with money. They suggest that five to 10% of the investments should be used for entertainment, such as investing in crypto, investing in a bar or trying angel investing if qualified. The compounding effect of investments is so significant that one can earn more from investments than from their income. The speaker advises against checking investment accounts regularly and panicking when the market goes down. Instead, they suggest setting up automatic investing and continuing to invest in index funds regularly. They explain that the market can go up and down but tends to return about seven to eight percent over time. Therefore, one should not panic in the short term and should focus on the long-term return."

Now if you've done all that stuff, you got your six month emergency fund, you've got your investments automated on autopilot and you still have money left over, you're in an awesome position and now you can do a couple of things. One, if you wanna keep growing that money, you can simply invest it in a non-retirement taxable account and that money will grow like crazy. If you're putting in 10, 20K a month, that money will turn into massive amounts. And if you guys don't believe me, just go search for compound interest calculator, bank rate has a really good one and plug in 20K a month for 10 years and that's it, just stop and watch what happens as that money goes. What is that, seven, 8%? Yeah, at 7% returns and watch what happens. It becomes like a tsunami, you cannot stop it. So that's one. The other thing is if you wanna invest in a little bit of fun stuff, if you're like, hey, I wanna take 10% of this and invest in like this crazy investment, my buddy's starting a thing, go ahead, just be prepared to write it off, maybe it works, maybe not. And then from there, you should also remember a third thing and nobody really talks about this. Maybe it's time to increase your quality of life. Maybe instead of staying in the middle back seat, it's time to upgrade to the exit row. Or business class. Business class or maybe it's time to eat at a different restaurant. Maybe it's time to really think about your money dial and say, hey, I always claim that wellness is important and yet I'm still eating like the same old thing I used to eat 10 years ago. Maybe it's time to upgrade what I eat and where I work out and all that kind of stuff, my gear. You can do that. You've made it. You already won the basic game. So now you get to benefit from it. What about real estate? There's a lot of people, I hear people that are all in on real estate investment or they're kind of like all in on the market. Yeah, I think that real estate, so a lot of people are gonna hate me after I say this. I know you guys have all been told since you were like two years old, real estate's the best investment ever. And it turns out that's not really true. A couple of things that might surprise me. If you're buying one home. If you're buying a house and living in it. If you're buying multiple units or buying multiple homes and that's your business, it might be a better method. Correct, let me make the distinction. So most people in America are told that the American life, the American dream is graduate from college, get married, buy a house, white picket fence, 2.5 kids and you made it. And I think we all just have to look at people who are a little bit older than us to realize that might not be our American dream. We might wanna travel more. We might wanna work remotely. I mean here we are in the middle of a weekday, chit chatting and sharing it with millions of people. This is our dream. So I wanna challenge people to really question what you've been taught. That's number one. Number two, most people who buy a house and live in it think that it is the best investment. But most people have never run into those. It's like my piggy bank. Yeah, they think that. They don't understand that when you spend money on a house, you've incurred tons of phantom costs. You have taxes, you have maintenance, you have all kinds of things that you don't count. And if you actually factor all those numbers in, real estate often, in fact many times, is not a great investment at all. It's a place to live and you have these phrases like you're throwing money away on rent. It's not true. Your landlord's making a profit, otherwise they wouldn't do it. That's not true. Your landlord can't charge you whatever they want. They can only charge you with the market. So if you search my name and real estate, you'll see all the numbers played out. Now, on the other hand, if you are a real estate investor and you're disciplined, that's a different story and that can be effective. But mom and pop who are thinking that they bought their house in 1970 for $200,000 and now it's worth 600,000, they think they made 400,000, actually not. If they had taken that money and put it in the market, they would probably have much, much more. Really?","In this discussion, the speaker talks about what to do with your money once you have your six-month emergency fund and investments automated. One option is to invest in a non-retirement taxable account, which can grow exponentially with compound interest. The speaker also suggests using some of the extra money to improve your quality of life, such as upgrading to business class or investing in wellness. The speaker challenges the traditional idea that real estate is the best investment, saying that it can often incur phantom costs and may not be a good investment for most people. However, if you are a disciplined real estate investor, it can be effective. The speaker suggests questioning what you've been taught and considering your personal goals before making investment decisions."

If you want to rent for the rest of your life, you absolutely can. Many people in New York, San Francisco and other high cost of living cities, they rent. There's no shame in that. I rent by choice. I could buy a place tomorrow, cash, and I choose to rent. Why do you choose to rent? After you've been here for 10 years and you've been renting the whole time. On purpose. And how much is that, do you think, over a half a million dollars? It's a lot of money. I rent a nice place. Why do I do it? Because. You could have used that money in something else. You could have put it in the market. I did. I put it in the market and I made more. Because you didn't put it in a home. Correct. Where there was a lot more money up front. It was more money up front. I used that money instead I put in the market. But there's also other reasons too. I couldn't get for the amount I'm paying where I live, if I were to buy a place in the same building or area, it would be four times more expensive. So that's the first. Second is maintenance. I'm going to give you an example. I woke up one day and the doorman was knocking on my doors like 830 in the morning on a Saturday. He's like, sir, sir, do you mind if we come in and take a look at something? I said, OK. And we go into the living room and there's a pool of water just sitting there. In your apartment. Yeah. It had dripped down three levels. So I was like, oh my God, they're like, sir, go back to sleep. We'll take care of it. That day they came. They repaired the floors. Not just of mine. The ceilings for the next two levels down. That's probably likely to have costed them. Let's just say 50K. Maybe 100K because it's Manhattan and it's a weekend service. Who knows? That's not my fee. You didn't pay for it. No. And I said, great. That's their problem. I'm going back to sleep, man. I got another hour of sleep here. So I want everyone. You don't have to believe me. You don't have to believe what someone else does. All you need to do is run the numbers. That is my only suggestion to you. Go to a buy versus rent calculator. Make sure you plug in all the fees, not just the taxes, the realtor fee. If you get a bigger place, you're probably going to get more furniture for it. The HOAs or the lawn maintenance or trash service or whatever it is. The key thing, I think, whether it's a house or investments, my point to you guys is take your money seriously. Once you take your money seriously and you put some time in it, whether it's this book or wherever you want to get your information, you're going to be better off for it. You don't want to delegate this to somebody else. I want you to understand it. And once you understand it and you automate it, you make a few good choices in life, you never have to worry about lattes or appetizers again. How do you make the emotional shift when you started renting an expensive apartment and you're like, man, if I added all this up after a year, that's close to a down payment on a nice house in the Midwest or they can buy a whole house in the Midwest. You know what I mean? Yeah. How do you emotionally rationalize that?","In the discussion, the speaker explains why they choose to rent instead of buying a house. One reason is that they could use the money they would have spent on a house for other investments that have yielded higher returns. Another reason is that the cost of buying a place in their area is much higher than renting. The speaker also gives an example of how the maintenance costs of owning a property can be expensive and inconvenient. They suggest that people should run the numbers and consider all the fees and costs associated with buying versus renting before making a decision. The key takeaway is that people should take their money seriously, educate themselves about investments, and make informed decisions that align with their financial goals."

You throwing this money away because sometimes I feel that way. Sometimes like, man, I just spent a lot of money in these last few years. Well, let me ask you this. But I like the freedom and the flexibility of not having to incur all those other. Yeah. What do you like to eat? You like strawberries? No. OK, what do you like to eat? It's a good steak and veggies. OK, steak. Well, once you when you buy a steak and you eat it, do you feel like you just threw your money away on that steak? No, I enjoyed it. But where is it? I don't see it. Where's my investment? Right. In fact, isn't it coming out in the toilet in a couple of hours? It is. Yeah. So what are we talking about here? You get value out of a steak, just like you get value out of renting. Now, if you want to incidentally build equity, that's great. But remember, you can also lose equity right now in Manhattan. Do you know rents are down? Yes. And so are prices of houses if you want to buy. They're going down every month. A lot of people like, oh, my God, it's so expensive. Sometimes. But sometimes it goes down five percent, 10 percent. Some of these neighborhoods are down 15 percent. No way. Yeah. So a lot of people don't realize. In fact, I did a survey of my readers. I said, do you think it's possible for real estate to decrease? Over half of people said no. They had never even thought about it. So I want 2008, 2009. Memories are short. You would think they would remember, but they don't. I heard people do they had three houses. They bought it. They were destroyed financially. They had their credit was ruined. They had to give up these houses and their identity as an investor. And three years later, they're like, I think I want to buy another couple of houses. It just goes to show I'm not saying they're stupid. It's not that at all, because a lot of people have gone through this. It's the idea that the propaganda to buy a house or to follow a prescribed set of rules for the American dream is so powerful that even losing your own houses doesn't change people's perspective. So how do you teach people to overcome the emotional rationalization of blowing their money? On rent. OK, it's funny. Besides that story you just told, which helps me. I'll tell you what, I want to acknowledge that it's real because it's a fear that people live with. Yeah. And I'll give you an example. Like I call it the handshake effect. And it's when people would come over to my apartment and for the first time and they would say, wow, this is an amazing view. And then they always say the same thing in New York. Do you own this place? And we're like shaking hands, right? It's like we just met, just met. How much you pay? Yeah, how much you pay? It's classic New York. And I say, no, I rent. And it's that moment where if I had said I bought, they would be like this. Wow. Pretty impressive. Really cool. Yeah. And you kind of get this pride. And then I and then when I don't say that, they get really confused because this is the I will teach you to be rich guy. But also he rents and I thought renting is for people who can't afford it. But, you know, they don't understand. And they give me this look. And I realized that so many of us are looking for somebody to approve of us while we are shaking their hands, someone we don't even know. And so instead of getting your approval from somebody you just met 10 minutes ago or from your parents, who probably are not the most sophisticated investors. If you're watching this show, you know, you talk about greatness and being great means choosing your own path. Sometimes you might choose to buy. I have no problem with that if you ran the numbers and you consciously decide. Sometimes it means you don't. But if you want to live the life of greatness, you need to be comfortable making different choices than what other people expect.","The discussion revolves around the debate of renting vs. buying a property. The speaker argues that renting can provide freedom and flexibility and that it's not necessarily throwing money away since you get value out of it, just like enjoying a good meal. Additionally, the speaker warns against blindly following the idea of the American dream and buying a property without considering the potential risks and losses that could occur, as was seen during the 2008-2009 financial crisis. Finally, the speaker encourages people to make their own decisions and not seek approval from others when it comes to their financial choices."

For example, you said that there's two things that everyone needs to be doing at a young age if you want to generate more wealth. Completely. Two things are investing in stocks and real estate. Is that right? Yeah. It's the two primary escalators to wealth. Escalators, where you can grow your money, your investment, your money can work for you as opposed to just sitting in the bank. Completely. It's like the game of Monopoly. I just literally explained this to my kids yesterday. I said, on the game of Monopoly, you go pass going to get a paycheck. If you just go around the properties and you land on them, you pay rent. You can't win the game of Monopoly unless you buy one green home, then two green homes, and three green homes, and four, then a hotel. You have to be an owner in the game of Monopoly. The ironic thing is that the game of Monopoly is a great lesson for all of us for life. You have to own assets that make you money while you sleep, that grow while you sleep. The challenge for most of America is that this stuff is not taught in school. This little book, The Latte Factor, I wrote it as a parable to reach the 98% of people who will not normally read a financial book. I've got my other stack over there. Most people won't ever read a financial book, so I thought if I write it as a story that you can read in less than 90 minutes and I can teach you these life lessons, the importance of paying yourself first. You don't need a budget. We'll talk about that a little bit. For instance, budgeting, everybody says you need a budget. Budgets totally don't work. People hate them. They hate them. They hate them. It's like dieting, right? You try to go on a budget and you're married. You will fight about those budgets. People go on them. It's totally frustrating. Do you believe in budgets or no? I don't. No. What I believe is you need to have a system that doesn't require discipline, does not take time. See, this is the part that's different. The secret to everything I've taught, like you've got my other book here, The Automatic Millionaire, is that the real secret to building wealth, how ordinary people in this country have built real wealth, is automation. They're saving money automatically. They're not even thinking about it. They're not thinking about it. Not stressing about it. They're not stressing about it. They're not writing checks. They're not putting cash in little buckets and envelopes and carrying these omelets in their thing and being like, okay, I've only got a little bit left. My grandmother, when she started at 30, she had nothing. She used to literally save 50 cents a week and put it in a coffee can. At the end of the year, she took that coffee can down to a brokerage firm and started investing in stocks. That's what changed the entire destiny of my family. Wow. Was that my grandmother at 30 with no college education, working at Gimbals Department Store in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, got tired of being poor. There's some people watching today that are there. They're listening. They're watching this or they're listening to this and they're tired of being poor. My grandmother was frustrated and she came home and said to my grandfather on her 30th birthday, Jack, this is not working. When you're the guy and you hear that, you're like, what do you mean this isn't working? My grandfather said, what's not working? She said, we're broke. We don't have any money. To my grandmother's credit, she decided to do something about it. She literally brown bagged her lunch. Every day she brown bagged her lunch so she could save that money and go invest. The way the story turns out, Louis, is my grandmother, my first book, Smart Women Finish Rich was dedicated to her. She didn't become rich overnight. She built wealth over her lifetime. I always say it's decades, not days. People who try to get rich quick stay broke long. It's true. Show me those banner ads on how to get rich quick and I'll show you a way to stay poor forever. My grandmother realized you invest in great American companies and you just keep investing and you leave it and you leave it and you leave it. She helped me buy my first stock at age seven in McDonald's. That was seven years old. She taught me three lessons about money at seven that to this day I still teach, which I can share with you. What's that? At seven, we're sitting at McDonald's and she says, you know, David, you can get rich at McDonald's. I looked around my grandma, I'm eating my cheeseburger and my french fries and I have my apple pie. I said, what are you talking about? And she's like, I'm not having a job here. She's like, see those people over there? They're working for what's called minimum wage. And I think back then minimum wage was like a dollar. And she said, it's very hard to make a living on minimum wage. She said, then there's people like you right now, like all these people are coming here and they're eating and they're spending money. That's called a spender. And she said, then there's some people who own this place and owners get rich. And she said, and I love to play Monopoly at seven. That was my thing. I go to my grandmother and she played Monopoly with me. And she said, I'm going to teach you how to play Monopoly for real. And she took me home that day. She opened up the Wall Street Journal. She circled MCD. That's the symbol still to this day from McDonald's. And she said, here's how much McDonald's is. She put me in front of a television screen and said, watch the ticker tape. She taught me how to read that ticker tape. And she said, just call out the price on MCD. That's the price of McDonald's. And she said, tomorrow I'll take you down to a broker's firm and we'll open up an account and you'll buy one share of that stock. And then every time you go there, you'll know you're making money from yourself. Wow. That is a wow, right? And it's funny because I'm here in LA with you, but I just went to Disneyland two days ago with my son, my son, who's nine. And Disneyland. Did you buy Disney? I bought Disney. That was my second stock. That's amazing. So like literally at nine, I'm at Disney with Grandma and I'm like, hey, Mickey, are you guys public? Like, you know, because she taught me to think as a child like an investor, investor, investor, investor, investor, investor, investor.","The discussion is about building wealth and personal finance.

Yeah, and the next year and actually right so but if I put a hundred thousand dollars into real estate I didn't put a hundred thousand dollars in real estate. I put in probably twenty thousand the bank loaned me 80 Mm-hmm. So when that hundred thousand dollars grows to 110, I Just made ten thousand dollars profit on twenty thousand dollar investment.

Yeah, and then I want them to own real estate if you have those two vehicles You pay yourself first you save money automatically and you own real estate and by the way, I'm not against I want people to own rental properties, too I own rental properties with my wife. She's got a rental property in our building But the way you get usually your first rental property you buy your first home Then you rent that home out then you buy a second home living that for a while monopoly It's not gonna play then rent that home out in the automatic millionaire I say three homes over a lifetime and you're done financially don't need to work. Yeah, two of them you rent it out You've got rental income the third one you've paid down You have no debt and now you're in your 50s or 60s and you're not dependent on social security Yeah, and those two homes should be paid off by then and then they're just paying you every month And we get people, you know posting our website all the time We had one there days ago, you know 10 years ago I had nothing and now i've got five rental homes because it's exactly what you talked about. Wow So it's it's these are not pie in the sky ideas I'm not telling people to go buy homes and flip them like I was listening to some radio out on the way over here and I thought Those are the things that don't usually work you go to one of those seminars and they're free and the next thing you know They're putting you into a 30 000 coaching program to flip homes I'm just talking about basic simple stuff pay yourself first one hour day of your income Don't budget save money automatically and get yourself a new piece of property and then pay the debt down What are three steps people should do right now? Whether they get this book or not. Yeah, they can start doing today that it's like if you did these three things right now It could help you set you up for financial freedom later. So number one thing Make a decision today to become financially selfish. Okay, and here's what I mean by that make a decision today to become financially selfish decide today To pay yourself first So like if you were gonna have like little chyrons, it would be like your first thing is become financially selfish pay yourself first The formula to paying yourself first Is one hour day of your income? If we could get everyone watching to make it a goal to save one hour day of their income whatever they're earning an hour Yeah, you'd be earning minimum wage Literally like you have a 15 dollar an hour job if you could save 15 hours a day 15 dollars a day. Yeah 15 dollars a day Your first hour day of your income your whole especially your 20s You'd have financial security by the time you reach retirement. So you can save 15 bucks a day for seven years Well seven years. I mean like it's like i'll go back to charts, right? Because it's not it's always a compound interest over decades, right? So if you look at like i've got these great charts back here like let's just use 15 dollars a day In 30 years at 10 percent happens to be it's 1 million 17 thousand dollars. So 15 dollars for 30 years Yeah in 40 years, it's I got without my glasses on 2.8 million. Wow in 10 years. It's 92 thousand dollars Still a lot by the way, it doesn't seem like a lot 10 years of savings doesn't but here's the thing These decades go by Like this if it's automatic, you know what to think about it you have to think about so I would say if you got a 401k plan Just from this podcast Go sign up for it And save one hour day of your income happens to be the math on that is 12 and a half percent of your gross income With your company's match, which you probably will have you'll be saving 16 of your income Which is like four times what the average american says huge. It's huge If you don't have a 401k plan go open up an ira account Fund that or if you're self-employed do a set by ira Second thing I would say is okay. So pay yourself first one hour one hour day of your income Yeah, second thing I would say is track where your money is going, but don't budget having a dream without a payment plan is a wish Having a dream where you're saving for it automatically That's how it becomes real. Yeah, they can hurt you. Yeah, they can hurt you. Yeah, they can hurt you They can hurt you. Yeah, they can hurt you","The discussion is about personal finance and how investing in real estate can be a better financial strategy than mutual funds. The speaker argues that although statistically the stock market has higher rates of return than real estate, investing in real estate can offer a much higher rate of return. This is because when you invest in real estate, you don't need to put the full amount of money down, as you can get a bank loan to fund most of it. As a result, you can make a much higher rate of return on your initial investment. Additionally, selling a personal residence after two years can give you a tax-free profit of up to a quarter of a million dollars if you're single and half a million if you're married. The speaker recommends that people use retirement accounts and invest in real estate, with the goal of owning three homes over a lifetime - two to rent out and one to pay off and generate passive income. The three steps that people can take to start setting themselves up for financial freedom are: become financially selfish, pay themselves first, and save one hour of their income per day."

Well, I think that you again, you have to figure out what makes you happy in life. And many times people don't know what makes you happy. I actually had no interest in making money. I came from a poor family. My father was a blue collar worker. I didn't have any interest in money. Nobody really talked about making money in my family. It wasn't something that was important to me. And I just wanted to work in politics and government where you don't make any money. So I realized later on, though, that the thing I had chosen to do, the law wasn't that exciting to me. And so I made a mid course correction when I was 37 and got into business and I liked it. I think people should experiment. I tell my children to experiment with many different things. And then, you know, by the time you're in your mid 30s, you should probably figure out what makes you happy and where you have some skills and then pursue something in that area. So you can still obviously make mid course corrections later on as well. I think that by the time you're 37, that you probably should have a reasonable sense of what your skills are, what you're good at, what you like, and then therefore probably pursue something in those areas where it takes advantage of them. But remembering that you should always have some outside interest. Just working all the time isn't going to make you happier necessarily. And so you should have some outside interest. You should learn how to get along with people, learn how to, you know, relax, learn how to be keep your body in shape, how to keep your mind in shape and just have a full and balanced life if it's possible to do so. If there were if there were I know you don't really have any regrets, but you say you wish you would have done other things like music, playing music and learning a language and, you know, whatever, taking care of health, maybe more as opposed to working as hard. If you could go back at 37 and you could say, OK, I want to commit to doing three things that I wish I would have done differently. Is that an instrument? Is that health? Is that, you know, relaxing, traveling? What are those three things you would have taken on differently? Obviously, hypothetical and you're happy with your app. But what would you do? Well, I wish I had probably been more involved in keeping my body in shape while I'm reasonably healthy. You know, I probably didn't exercise enough and and I wasn't really that didn't find a sport that I was good enough at to really stick with. So I wish I had been more involved in exercise and health kind of things. Secondly, I wish I had probably learned how to do something more creative, you like to play a musical instrument or or do something in the arts. I'm involved in the arts as a donor and so forth, but I don't have any artistic skills. And I, you know, be there, be a painter, be a musician, be something that is more creative. I wish I had done that. And I wish I had spent more time, you know, probably as everybody says, with your children. You know, when you have children, when you're growing up, when they're little kids, you know, you, you know, you can't do that much with them. You can change the diapers or or you can run after them, teach them how to do some things. But when you're building your career, there's a temptation to kind of hand off the kids to others. And maybe I would probably in hindsight, I wish I had spent more time with my children now. Now, I have three children, all of whom have MBAs. And you can say I made a terrible mistake because there are no poets, there's no artists there. They're all MBAs and they're all in private equity. So you could say that these are very successful or very unsuccessful, depending on your point of view. But as you get older, you realize, you know, the most important thing in the world is relationships. So you want to have relationships with your children and and ultimately your grandchildren and so forth. So, you know, if I could do it all over again, I'd do some things differently. But on the whole, I got lucky in life and I could be very well. I've been the case that I didn't get a job at the White House. I didn't start a firm like mine. And I would today probably be just retired as a mediocre lawyer and living in, you know, somewhere in Florida playing shuffleboard. That didn't happen. So I'm reasonably happy with that. Yeah. And what would you say? I mean, you have a lot of conversations with, you know, the wealthiest people in the world, but you're also friends with these people.","The discussion centers around advice for someone in their mid-thirties looking to build their business and create a richer life without any regrets. The speaker suggests that people should experiment with different things to figure out what makes them happy and where they have skills, then pursue something in those areas. It's important to have a full and balanced life with outside interests, including taking care of one's health and learning something creative. The speaker also expresses regret for not spending more time with his children and wishes he had done things differently in that regard. Ultimately, the most important thing in life is relationships. The discussion briefly touches on the speaker's connections with wealthy individuals."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNJhP_zgc7A_sep_4182_4506,UNJhP_zgc7A_sep_4182_4506,"very fortunate to the people I interview, you know, I stay in touch with and I become friends with and hopefully I can stay friends with you, David after this. But what are some of the behind closed door conversations that people actually open up about their regrets that they're really wealthy? Is it around I wish I would have worked out more and been healthy because, you know, you know, a lot of people see Steve Jobs is like, okay, he would have given up all the money in the world to have more years of his life. You know? Well, nobody who's wealthy ever says I wish I was really a lot wealthier. No one nobody says that. Because you realize how much money do you really need to spend and so forth. So what people will say is, I wish I had spent more time smelling the roses. I wish I had spent more time with my children. I wish I had spent more time developing relationships around the world or around the country where I could get to know areas that I'm not an expert in. Nobody says I need to make more money. I need to be higher in the Forbes 400 list. And then, you know, people, you know, when you get to a certain point, look, all human beings as a general rule of thumb, with the exception of point 00001% want to live longer. Now, even people that have very unhealthy situations or are in poverty, nobody says a general rule of thumb, I really don't like living, I want to die. Now, obviously, people do commit suicide, it's a very small percentage of the population. So why do people want to live longer? Well, there's a general rule of thumb, life has a lot of pleasures to it, and you can be happy. And that's a good feeling. So people, I think what they most want to do when they get wealthy is figure out how they can keep this good thing going for a while. So all of a sudden, you see, you know, very wealthy people starting to have exercise classes or our trainer, or, you know, working out more, or eating healthier, and doing things that can enable them to live longer and have the benefits that they've worked for, but have it longer. And that's what most people want. Now your age, the last thing you're thinking about is retirement, or you're going to die soon, and you better get things done. So you know, you're so young. But at some point, when you're 67 or 77, you'll think about it a little bit differently. Yeah, it's funny, though, because time has a, you have a different sense of time at different stages of your life. When I was like, nine, 10 years old, I remember thinking someone in their 40. I was like, man, they're, they're about to retire. They're older, you know, it's, they didn't look as healthy back then when I was in the 80s and early 90s. It was like, oh, man, they're, they're kind of over the hill. But now people are living way longer, they're staying more active in their 50, 60s. Of course, people live longer. When people came out of caves, 400,000 years ago, the average life expectancy was 20. At the beginning of the 20th century, in 1900, the average life expectancy in the United States was 49. No way. 49. So today, people expect to live longer. Now, when I was a young boy, there was a president named Dwight Eisenhower. And you probably don't remember him, but you may have seen pictures of him. And I used to say, boy, that is an old, old man. Old, old man. Okay. How old was he? Well, he was elected president at 62. And he left when he was 70. So he's younger than I am now. When I was in the White House, I was, I was 33 at the at the last year. I'm sorry, 31, 31 years old. And we were running against Ronald Reagan, who was 69. And I said, President Carter, you don't have to worry because Ronald Reagan's so old, he's 69, he can't get out of bed in the morning. Now that's two years younger than me. I read the other day when John Kennedy was assassinated. In November 22, 1963, they told the Speaker of the House who was next in line succession after the vice president that he would be right after the vice president, he fainted on when he was told this that he was next in line to be president United States of Lyndon Johnson was killed or something, nobody knew whether Johnson was going to be killed that day. Well, he fainted and they said he was an old old man. It's not unexpected, they would faint. How old was he? He was 71. So, you know, you know, you know, I'm now that age. So, you know, it's surprising. On the other hand, you have people like Warren Buffett, who are 90 years old, brain still going strong, you just don't know exactly what it is. But clearly, you know, when you hit the age of 60, you live more than you're going to live. And so, you know, you want to race to get things done. I'm doing what I call sprinting to the finish line, which is to say, I'm trying to get stuff done that I never really did before. But I keep saying I better get it done. Because who knows when my brain is going to go away or the body is going to go away. So you're too young to remember this. And most of your listeners and viewers are probably too young. But at some point, you realize that something's going to go wrong. It's a funny thing you have your body you've got that you were given by your your parents, and his brain you were given by your parents, but you don't know which of these body parts is going to check out at some point, it could be that cancer comes along, it could be your brain doesn't work, and you just don't know. So you just got to keep going as long as you can, hoping that these things stay along with you as long as you really want to want to be there. Clearly, it's some things sometimes things aren't going to stay around and some body parts aren't going to work and you won't be able to do everything you want to do. So you want to get things done before then. So you don't have regrets when you're looking back when you're looking back when you're looking back when you're looking back.","The conversation revolves around wealthy people and their regrets. According to the speaker, most wealthy individuals regret not spending enough time with their loved ones, not developing relationships outside their field of expertise, and not enjoying life enough. He notes that when people accumulate wealth, they become more conscious of their mortality and strive to live longer. Consequently, many wealthy individuals engage in activities that promote longevity such as exercising and eating healthy. The speaker also mentions that people are living longer, and it's not unusual for individuals to be active well into their 60s and 70s. Overall, the discussion highlights the importance of valuing relationships and enjoying life, even as one accumulates wealth."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNJhP_zgc7A_sep_4507_4806,UNJhP_zgc7A_sep_4507_4806,"Wow. Yeah, I think when I remember growing up, when people hit 40, they hit the midlife crisis back in the, you know, when I was in the my young years. But when people had 40, that's when they went through the crisis, because I guess the expectancy expectancy was more around 70 or 80. OK, put it this way. If you were an NBA basketball player today, you would be called an old man. Right. LeBron James is 35, 36. OK, they're making fun of Roger Federer. He's 39 years old. How can he play tennis anymore? He's an old, old man. You know, dominating. Right. But in some sports, you're an old person. Sometimes there are some athletes who retire in their 20s. John McEnroe basically retired more or less when he was 29. Boris Bjorn Borg retired when he was 25, I think. So some of these athletes, they're old when they get to be older. You if you were a professional athlete today in almost any sport, unless you're, you know, Tom Brady, you'd be considered an old man, even though you're young. If you came to my investment firm, we would say, hey, this guy's young. He's too inexperienced. We can't give him too much responsibility. If you're in the sporting world, all of a sudden, you're an aged, aged person. Yeah. If you're a gymnast, you're a 16 year, 18 year old, you know, retired 18. Jack Nicklaus, I considered to be maybe along with Tiger Woods, the greatest golfer of all time. What was his most impressive accomplishment? I interviewed him for my book and he had a lot of accomplishments, of course. But the one that most amazed people is that he won the Masters when he was 46 years old. How can anybody get out of bed in the morning of that old when you're in the golf? But he wanted it 46 and Tiger Woods wanted it 43 when he had all those back surgeries. And but those guys in the golf world, 40 is kind of older. Remember, at 50, you can you can play on the seniors tour. Wow. Wow. Yeah, this is fascinating. I'm curious. Yeah, it just seems like this last three years, really, there has been just what it feels like to me, a wave of ups and downs, and especially in our country, ups and downs in the world, whether it be politically, whether it be society, whether it be our cultures and new generations coming up, people trying to change old ways and create new ways. What advice do you have for the younger leaders in their teens and 20s for navigating? It just seems like everything's changing so quickly of like roles and responsibilities and politics and everything. What advice do you get for young people to be a leader during so much uncertainty and chaos and unknowns? How do they learn to lead and have farsightedness when everything's changing all the time? You can't control everything, of course. But I think people who are, let's say, your age, if they want to be leaders, the skills that I think are very important that really people should focus on other than the obvious persistence and so forth is continue to learn. You know, we call college graduations commencements. Why is that? It's the end of college, but actually commencement, it means beginning. And it really means it's the beginning of life and the beginning of your education. 30 percent of people who graduate from college never read another book in their life. They think they're done. So learning, always learning, figuring out, secondly, how to improve your skill set. How can you write better? How can you how can you talk better? Remember, communicating is the only way to influence people. People are only influenced if you can communicate with them. And how do you communicate with them? By writing, by talking or by leading, by example, doing things like that. Well, practicing those skills. I tell people, you know, people often say to me, well, you're pretty good at making a speech. I said, well, I wasn't considered very good many years ago. I took every imitation I could get and I just practice. I made mistakes and eventually you get better at it. You know, when you first started this program, I assume you weren't as good as you are now, right? You've learned a lot. Yeah. So take advantage of things. Learn how to perfect yourself and focus. You know, in my resume shows, I've got lots of different things I'm doing, but I I started focusing on one or two skill sets. And then once you have those, people come to you and ask you to do more things. So if you're very good at something, people assume that you may be good at something related to it. You'll get more responsibility, more opportunities and so forth. And you can never meet too many people. Everybody is helped along the way by somebody having contacts, making networking people. You never know who's going to call you up and say, here's a business deal. Here's a job opportunity. Here's somebody you should hire. And so if you think about how you met your spouse, how you met your partner, how you met your business partners, it all came about through some, you know, a kind of serendipity that came about because you met somebody who introduced a who introduced who introduced, who introduced, who introduced, who introduced and who introduced, who introduced.","The discussion covers a range of topics but includes advice for younger leaders in their teens and 20s who are navigating uncertain and chaotic times. The speaker recommends continuing to learn and improve skill sets, such as communication, by practicing and taking advantage of opportunities. Additionally, the speaker emphasizes the importance of networking and meeting people, as it can lead to business deals, job opportunities, and other benefits."

And I said I called them and They just looked at me and I was like why would you do? They're like well I go to trade shows and I set up my booth and I'm Waiting for the Neiman Marcus fire to come by and we've been doing it every year for seven years I didn't even know there were trade shows.

So how could I possibly know but you know, it's inside of you Yeah, and you're willing to be creative and risk, you know failure in a way that most people aren't you put yourself? Out there in a major way and you said hey come to the bathroom with me, right? And I'm not gonna do anything weird Yeah, amazing. It's incredible story. My dad used to encourage me to fail Mmm, so at the dinner table growing up He would ask my brother and me what we failed at that week Wow, and if we didn't have something to tell him he'd be disappointed And I vividly remember being a little girl and saying I tried out for this dad and I was horrible and he would high-five me They go way to go Wow, so he's reframing my definition of failure So failure for me became about not trying not the outcome for those that don't know spank Can you share how it all started so we have an understanding of what it is and how you got into it? Absolutely It actually started with my own butt Because I couldn't figure out what to wear under white pants and I'm sure you've had this problem all the time So what ended up happening was there was you know, right our undergarment options were no good There was underwear that left a panty line and then there was the girdle that was way too thick and heavy And so then they came out with the thong which just put underwear exactly where we've been trying to get it out of And so Spanx was born out of just being a frustrated consumer I wanted to wear my clothes I wanted a smooth canvas I didn't want to see lines or any kind of yeah things going on underneath. So By taking the hosiery material which was meant to be seen on the leg and tell Spanx sort of looked at it with a different lens and Said no, no, no I want the hosiery material to actually be what I create the undergarment out of and it was wild trying to convince the hosiery Manufacturers to help me make this product with that in mind because for so many years They'd been using the material to be seen on the leg, right? I said no It's the perfect material to create the perfect canvas for women under our clothes and it opened up my wardrobe It opened up so many other women's wardrobe. We could start wearing colors. We didn't feel comfortable wearing and The models get airbrushed we get Spanx Well, I cut the feet out of my pantyhose in 1998 Wow. Yes, I was Am I doing my math? Yes I was 27 and then I spent the next two years getting it made I worked at night and on the weekends on the idea while I was selling fax machines door-to-door And then the company was launched in 2000 when I was 29","The discussion involves the founder of Spanx, Sara Blakely, discussing how not knowing the ""right"" way to do things can actually be an asset. She shares a story about how she landed Neiman Marcus by simply calling them, while others had been trying to get in for years through trade shows. She also talks about how her dad encouraged her and her brother to fail and how that reframed her definition of failure. Blakely then shares how she started Spanx out of frustration with undergarment options and how she had to convince hosiery manufacturers to use their material in a different way.

So it's interesting and I love that question by the way because I still remember I grew up middle class but my parents were working really hard trying to make ends meet at that stage. So I remember that we didn't have a lot of it. I still have pictures as a little baby in the background. We had like bookshelves and it was like on bricks and on pieces of wood. So yeah, I think that was kind of like my first memory with it but I love the question because we all grew up differently. We all have we grew up in different parts of the world, right? We don't get to choose where we are born, to who our parents are, who our families are, what community we're in, religion, language and that kind of stuff. And that plays a big part into your paradigm and your worldview and your relationship with money. So I love that question. So you were in South Africa and I've heard you say that you once had a scarcity mindset. Yes. What were some of those early experiences in South Africa that shaped that sort of mindset of money? Yeah, it was, you know, I think it came back to the childhood memory too. Seeing that my parents were working really, really hard trying to make ends meet and there was never really, you know, there was an abundance at that time. So they, like I said, worked really hard to provide and provided that. But we always were cognizant of money and spending money. So that's where you essentially develop your relationship with money, right, as a child because we don't necessarily learn by what people tell us. We learn by what we see in the conversation. So we never talked about money in the house, but it was always sort of a scarce thing. You know, money, I heard the same thing as a lot of people have heard. Money doesn't grow on trees. You know, it takes money to buy that. We don't have money for that right now, that kind of stuff. So yeah, so that has a huge impact and it provides a scarcity mindset because you kind of develop a mindset of a world of not enough, right? And it takes a massive, massive effort to change that. Maybe there could be some experiences that change changes that once a while, but it takes a massive effort to actually switch that mindset from scarcity to abundance. You're a big cash flow guy. That's not something that most kids are exposed to. What did you want to do when you were a kid? Well, essentially, I just wanted to play sports. I was into sports and I wanted to play sports and play sports at the highest level. So I guess if you had to ask me what did I want it to be when I grew up, it was playing professional sports. I loved it. I loved the teammates. I loved working really hard. I loved the goal setting part of it, the personal development. That's how I really got into it. But eventually, you know, the money thing came later and it actually came as a side effect of sports because I started traveling a lot, playing in different cities, playing in different countries and so forth. So what do you do to kill a lot of downtime when you're not playing sports or either practicing or training? Well, you pick up hobbies or habits or something like that. So a lot of folks got into video games. A lot of folks got into other sorts of stuff, reading novels and so forth. I got into money because my mother gave me a book, Rich That Poor Dead by Robert Kiyosaki because at that stage, they were going through some changes in their life again, too. She came across the book. Of course, he's a great marketer. So it was in the window of every store, saw it and paused it to me. And that kind of made me embarked on that journey to understand that, hey, I have a really big opportunity here. I could pursue a career in sports, but I can learn other skills and I can learn other things while I'm doing this so that eventually when this pauses and this phase of my life pauses, I would have certain skill sets and capabilities and knowledge and frameworks and models to actually go out and do something, right? You were competing at a very high level athletically. Was that the U.S. national rugby team? Yeah, so I was on the U.S. national rugby team. I was in the pool for a number of years and I was actually in the 2007 Rugby World Cup training squad. And eventually, my career ended that same year with an injury. But yeah, I played at a very high level for a number of years, which was a great experience. I learned a lot of things that actually equipped me for the next phase of my life. Yeah, it's a lot of lessons to be drawn from sports, whether it's listening to your coach and finding the right coach, training, discipline. What is it about Robert Kiyosaki's book that was so life-changing for you? Because it sounds pivotal in your life. Yeah, it was. At that stage, like I said, I was trying to learn something else and I was reading a couple of different books around money. And I came across his book and it was completely a game changer because of the different context that it provides. Not necessarily the content. If you ask a lot of people, what did you learn about that? Some folks, they say cash flow. Yes, okay, we understand that. But I think the big picture is it shifts your context of how you see the world of money. So for me, it really changed the way that I look at it and say, wait a second, there's a game here, just like the game that I'm playing right now. There's rules here, just like the game that I'm playing right now. There's players. There are absolutely great players and there are average players. What do the great players in this game of money do? And then I looked at this and said, well, if you want to excel, like you said, in sports and play at the highest level, you've got to get the team behind you to get you there. Your strength and conditioning coach, your mindset and psychological coach, your actual game coach, your defensive coach, or whether you're head coach, you need a team behind you. And I'm like, that's how the best players in money, that's how they actually do it as well. So there was a lot of overlap in that and it just was a big a-ha moment for me and I'm a person that loves to take action. So in sports, when somebody said, let's do this, I would go and do it because I trusted the people around me. So the same thing through the book, I took action. Looking back now, it's kind of funny, but I dived into real estate. I bought my first property. I was 21 years old, about 20, 21 years ago. And I was very lucky that it worked out really well, very quickly, where I collected all of the rent, I paid all of the expenses associated with it, and there was money left over at the end of the month. And I looked at this and I go, wow, this could actually work. And of course, then school started, right? Because then you have bad tenants that don't pay rent, people that damage your property. But essentially, it was a game changer for me because it changed the context in which I view the world of money. So I think that's the big power.","The discussion is about personal finance and how early experiences can shape an individual's mindset towards money. The guest talks about his childhood memories of his parents working hard to make ends meet and how that influenced his scarcity mindset. He discusses his love for sports and how he eventually got interested in personal finance through reading books. He shares how Robert Kiyosaki's book ""Rich Dad, Poor Dad"" was a game-changer for him, as it provided a different context that shifted his worldview about money.

Can you take us through your first couple of properties and investments, what did that look like? Yeah, so the first thing that I will say for someone that's interested in cash flow, the big thing about money and the game of money is that there are so many ways to go about it. It isn't just specific one asset clause or one asset. Yes, there's a blueprint. If you look at all the different ways that you can do it, there's sort of a core kind of, I would say, there's a core checklist of things that need to be in place. But that's the one thing that I would share with your listeners is that there's so many different ways to do it. We live in a world of marketing, of course, and there's maximalists everywhere. So this person is, this is the only way to do it. And this person says that's the only way to do it. And that's the first thing that I would share with your listeners is there's many ways to do things. It depends what your interests are, what you're passionate about, what your knowledge base is, what you like to study and learn. I'll share one example before I dive into the second part of your question. I have someone in my network that he is a medical professional and he used to buy practices, medical practices that are distressed. And he had a formula and a blueprint of how to take those medical practices and bring in his team, that was his unique ability, how he provides value to the marketplace in the world, and restructure those medical practices and turn them around to be very profitable and cash flowing machines. So that was his gift, his unique ability, his knowledge. He comes from the medical world, he understands the business and so forth. So he reached out to me the one day, he's like, well, I wanna start investing in real estate and I wanna start investing in Bitcoin and so forth. And I was asking him why, why, trying to get to the bottom of this. And it turns out because he's just seeing that other people are doing it. And I said, you understand what you're doing already is you're a cash flow investor. And he's like, what do you mean? I said, you have the ability, your investment niche is businesses, more specifically the medical practices. You can go in with your formula and your team and your relationships, you can fix it up and you can produce cash flow in those businesses. And I said, and by the way, who owns the properties that these businesses are in? He said, well, I do. I said, well, there you go. So you own the real estate which you generate cash flow from, you have the businesses that produce something for you. So you're already doing that. And then of course he's diversified in other areas. But I wanted to share that because there's so many different ways to do it. So understand where your unique ability, your gift, your knowledge base, your relationships and so forth. Because after that call he's like, oh, so I'm doing the cash flow thing already. But yeah, in the example of my own life, the first thing that I wanted to do is I started with, I was very, very young. So I started with, it was an apartment complex with condominiums, I guess is what you would refer to it in South Africa that was in a very up and coming part of town. So I understood being from that area, what was going on in the marketplace, speaking to a lot of people because I didn't know anything. So that was great because a lot of people would share because they're like, well, this kid doesn't know anything. I'll tell them what's going on. This kid needs help. Yeah, this kid needs help. So I found out that there was an area that a lot of people were moving to because it's pretty close for a commute to the city of Cape Town. And it was very up and coming. There was a lot of real estate investors moving in there from speaking to real estate investors, asking a ton of questions at that stage. So yeah, so then I knew where I wanted to look for a place. And then I found a place that was within my price range, a two bedroom, one bath, two blocks from the beach that had about a 30 minute commute to Cape Town. And I thought to myself, this will be a great place to buy this property because I could get tenants in them, renters in there, and it's going to be in demand. And like I said, I was very, very fortunate and lucky that the first deal that I did was in the right place. It was rented very fairly easily to folks. And it never really had a problem renting it. And of course, I got nice appreciation in that area because a lot of people were moving in. And the same thing, properties following that in the United States, I kind of took the same approach to that. The one mistake that I did make is I was so focused just on one thing instead of looking at an overall well strategy. And I think for investors sometimes they just think of one thing, one stock or one cryptocurrency or real estate and so forth, that they miss all the other pieces around it. And one of the things that I miss was I should have proper reserves in place. I should have proper capital allocation outside of the real estate, but I just got so excited and I'm a young kid, so didn't know any better. So as I was buying my first property in the United States and I got tenants in and rented it, and I wanted to buy more and more properties, one of the things initially that helped me back that I needed to figure out was having other things around me because what happens in real estate is tenants don't pay, things break, the normal stuff, the usual stuff. And you need reserves for that, otherwise now you're back on credit cards or as an investor. Did you learn that the hard way? I learned that the hard way, the very hard way, yeah. So as I was trying to buy more properties, yeah, I mean, I had another property under contract and then all of a sudden a pipe burst in one of the other properties. And it happens more than often that when a pipe bursts and a property is not usable for a while, tenants don't wanna pay rent in that property too. So you have those kind of things, but I think the big thing from a cash flow investor that I learned is it's not just the investment of cash flow that you have to look at, it's also the cash flow in your personal economy, having proper capital allocation, having reserves, right? How many people learned that lesson last year if they didn't have any reserves in place or money that they can access because they now either lost their job or they are unable to work and so forth. So I think cash flow is one thing and you think cash flow, you think investments, but it's also your economy of what's happening inside of it.","The speaker emphasizes that there are many ways to create income and cash flow and that there is no one right way to do it. He gives an example of a medical professional who invests in distressed medical practices, which are then turned into profitable businesses. The speaker advises finding one's unique ability and knowledge base to determine the best investment strategy. He also shares his own experience of investing in real estate, starting with a two-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment complex in an up-and-coming area of Cape Town. He stresses the importance of having an overall strategy, rather than just focusing on one asset, and of having proper reserves and capital allocation in place."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uJBchCbc1M_sep_1059_1255,0uJBchCbc1M_sep_1059_1255,"back to where we started, because you've had the luxury and privilege of interviewing so many cashflow ninjas and learning so much yourself, what does that investment team look like? It's a great question. And it all depends on the needs, but essentially all of them have, well, the big part of the first thing that I've noticed with them is they're sort of a formula of their intellectual capital paired with their relationship capital. And that usually gives you financial capital. That's the one thing that I've noticed with all of them, because all of them really invested in themselves as the asset developed themselves, increased their intellectual capital, and then they developed relationship capital, meaning folks in their network, masterminds, coaches, mentors, all of them. Seek out a mentor, every single one of them, because you don't know what you don't know. I have to say, looking back as a young kid too, the one thing that I did, and I made a lot of mistakes, more mistakes than it could count, but the one thing was I'm like, I have to find someone to help guide me that's done it before, and that's what they all have. So the first member of their team usually is they find a mentor, and the mentor helps them to put the other pieces together, because again, you don't know what you don't know when you first get started. So a mentor, for example, can share with you, not only the team members that you would need, let's just say, let's stick with real estate, if you're a real estate investor, who you would need, and who you would need on your team, but he can also, on the other side, go, just not lose sight of, for example, your tax strategy too, because that's why you're becoming a real estate investor. So you need a tax strategy. You need an asset protection strategy. You need an estate strategy when all these things come together. So besides your real estate investing, you need all these other things in place. So I think that's the big thing that I've learned from them, is that's the first person that they would bring on to their team. And then as they grow and they reach a new level, they find other mentors to take them to the next level. MC, you've built so much in 20 years being in the United States, from that first investment property to building a business, having a podcast. How many revenue streams do you have currently? Yeah, a significant amount. Different in your business, so you would have, in your business, you would have different revenue streams, and it could be, like in the podcast, let's just use Cashflow Ninja, so you would have sponsorships, affiliates, and products that we design. You would have, in our other business, we have, for example, products that we sell to that one. Then there's several asset costs that I'm invested in. So currently six of them. So in between them, there's different ones. So I haven't counted every single one of them, but I'm going to say that it's probably between 15 and 20, or 20, or 20.","The discussion is about the investment team that successful investors have. The guest speaker mentions that successful investors invest in themselves and build their intellectual capital and relationship capital, which leads to financial capital. They stress the importance of finding a mentor, who can guide them and provide advice on who to have on their team. The mentor can also provide advice on other important aspects such as tax strategy, asset protection, and estate planning. The discussion then shifts to the guest speaker's business and the various revenue streams they have, which include sponsorships, affiliates, and products, as well as several asset classes they are invested in. They estimate having between 15 to 20 revenue streams."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uJBchCbc1M_sep_1256_1669,0uJBchCbc1M_sep_1256_1669,"And how do you think about when you're because it's got to take some creativity and trying to figure out What do you want to build in the next 12 months or three years? How do you kind of look at your portfolio and think about what to work on next? That's a great question. So I try to figure out and I'm a big student of history and economics And I love love those topics and I love studying obviously finance I have an MBA in finance and I love studying what banking and and what's happening in the financial world and Monit the Monit global monetary system. So I look at all that and that's sort of a framework that I that I use that It's I'm looking at. Okay, where are we in history? How did we get here? What's currently happening and we're What are the probability of the following things happening because of where we are and and what got us here? So that's one of the the frameworks that I use the other framework that I use is I'm part of a coaching group called Strategic coach by Dan Sullivan. It's a great phenomenal group and Dan is a framework called DOS dangers opportunities and strengths It's a great by the way I use this every single day for my businesses and my investments and the first thing that I do is I look at the dangers That are out there. So I look at what threats or dangers are there to my business and or my investments and then the second part of that is What opportunities exists because if there's a ton of threats and like for example disruption There's gonna be massive disruption with AI machine learning 3d printing 5g the Internet of things well, I mean we could go on and on with all the stuff rolling out We're now in the fourth industrial revolution Essentially so that could be a threat and you could sit there paralyzed or you could go Wow Okay, I see these threats but how do the opportunities that this brings with it? It's just it's it's it's so about there's so many opportunities. So how can I leverage and Utilize some of those opportunities in my business. What other businesses can I invest in for example that will position? Myself to capitalize on certain trends So I'll share one trend with you what to that is it's just gaining momentum and steam that I see Because I use the threats and I look at the opportunities is Privacy the need for privacy people are realizing that nothing is private that they want more Privacy in all areas of their lives and businesses have already capitalized on on those opportunities So from phones that are encrypted to computers that are encrypted to Things that you can put devices in from emails Cloud software, I mean you know just think of the industry already. It's nuts and The majority of the public hasn't even gotten to the privacy part yet. So I look at that and say hmm There's a trend. How do I how do I position myself? Can I create a product for example in cash flow ninja to teach and provide an intellectual shortcut on privacy? Having a VPN having private browsers how to protect your online identity You know all that kind of stuff or is there another business that for example There's a computer company that are doing the encrypted computers and and phones. They're looking for investors can I invest in that company? So, you know, and how can I capitalize on that and that's a third part of the DOS framework the dangerous opportunities and strengths What skill sets and capabilities do I have? Skill sets meaning Can I provide value do I have knowledge already of this? Do I use this? Can I teach this? Capabilities do I have capital to deploy into other businesses? You know another thing that a lot of people talk about and I'm sure you've talked about it too is cryptocurrencies and blockchain so when people when I say that all they think about is coins and speculating and coins I like to follow the California Gold Rush strategy Where the California Gold Rush strategy is the people that actually made fortunes during the Gold Rush Wasn't the people that went to California in 18 was at 49 To ban for gold and dig for gold was the people actually selling the shovels the picks the equipment The people selling clothes and shoes like Levi and Strauss Yeah jeans the people that house them the people that fed them the people that provide entertainment the people that provide financial services Wells Fargo comes out of that so in that space I'm or I'm looking more at I'm not looking for a coin to bet bet something on and speculate I'm looking at and seeing who's building businesses for that world where this is going to and Figure out if I can directly invest in them as an investor So for example if you were able to invest in an exchange which coinbase is now obviously public But if you were able to invest in an exchange before it went public or even afterwards Well now you're an investor in the cryptocurrency exchange So you don't care if Bitcoin the price dips 55% or it goes up 100% Because the volumes of transaction or transactions are about the same either way and you as the investor Get to now invest in a business in that space that increases in value because the more and more people use it So that's kind of our look at what's the neck? What's next? You know? What's next in business and investing is like so much so much opportunities with all these many things and you know another trend That I'll touch on is probably biotech. I mean look at the upward potential just in Biotech companies and what they're putting out so you're looking at where the kind of the puck is going using the sport analogy to With with Wayne Gretzky you look at what happened. Where are we right now? How did we get here the world fast forward at 10 years and six months, you know in and during the during 2020 I always say to folks listen we were gonna end up here anyway in 10 years, you know People were gonna work from home, you know, they weren't gonna go into an office necessarily to go and work The delivery, you know the shipping robotics, you know packaging that kind of stuff. So we were gonna get here anyway But how do we how do we find opportunities now because there's just too many of them actually Which is kind of comical, you know, you and I talked about the scarcity mindset, but you know instead of shrinking Hiding your head in the sand looking at what's going on and saying everything is scary, you know I just can't deal with this no deal with it because you're gonna see a plethora of opportunities for yourself for yourself for yourself for yourself for yourself for","The discussion is about how to determine what to invest in and build in the next few years. The speaker is a student of history, economics, and finance, and he looks at the current state of the global monetary system to figure out where we are and what the probability is of certain things happening. He also uses the DOS framework (dangers, opportunities, and strengths) to identify the threats and opportunities that exist in the market. One trend that he sees gaining momentum is the need for privacy, and he looks at how he can position himself to capitalize on this trend. He also looks at cryptocurrencies and blockchain, not to speculate on coins but to invest in businesses that are building for that world. Another trend he mentions is biotech, and he advises looking at where the puck is going to figure out what's next in business and investing."

So there are always opportunities on the horizon and people pivot and adapt. Do you need to carve out time? Because you're an owner operator with these multiple income streams. Do you need to carve out time for that strategic thinking? That sounds so important. I have thinking time. So I have a process that I call thinking time. So I think for an hour a day by myself and I sit with a notepad and I perform these exercises. And I think that's, you know, there's a mentor of mine that told me this because sometimes you get caught and you just focus on, you're just all in and you don't stop. You just keep going and going and going. And he said to me, you know, he said to me, MC, if you go on like this, you're going to work hard and make a lot of money, but you're not going to build any wealth because you're just focusing on, you know, the money part. You're not focusing on actually getting wealthy. And I was like, what do you mean? And there was a quote from Henry Ford that was kind of similar. Don't work too hard that you don't have any time to build wealth or something like that. I butcher quotes. That's what I do. But it's to the same extent. So I made an intentional goal that I do every day and I sit down and I think about this. I think it's very important because otherwise, if we just keep going and we're living in a society where it's like just little things drawing you in from all over the place, you're never going to be able to just sit down and figure out what's going on. Think deeply through certain scenarios. You're not going to realize what's going on. So for me, it's great. I would recommend that anyone do that because focus, I mean, it's a lot of work focusing on your own wealth and your well strategy. It's a lot of work. It takes, you know, the whole thing that where I review the businesses and my investments and look at all the stuff. I do that about once a month and that takes a couple of hours, sometimes half a day. Sometimes it could take a full day, depending on how I deep dive. But during the week, definitely do some thinking time because like you said, more and people should probably look this up in their favorite search engine because I don't know the exact number but there's more millionaires and billionaires, I mean, created in such a short span of time like last year. I forgot the statistic that I read and what do they say? Ninety nine percent of statistics are made up, right? But I forgot the statistic, but it was incredible to see how many millionaires and billionaires were made. And for listeners out there, you know, in a crisis, just think of what happened in 2008 and 2009. It gave us Uber and Airbnb and all the entire sharing economy was created in that crisis. So it's the same thing. The same thing that happened last year where there was a plethora. Just think of all these delivery companies, you know, the Uber eats of the world and that kind of stuff that just exploded. Zoom, you know, there's so many companies that did really well because of the environment and they were able to adapt. Yeah, and then for those who had cash reserves, those crises pose buying opportunities, whether it's real estate or stocks, all kinds of assets. Those are good buy points. And to your point, that's again with the whole cash flow management thing is if you had cash reserves, part of your own economy cash flow, absolutely, you were able to capitalize on opportunities and buy stocks or real estate or, you know, crypto currencies at very low evaluations or even in businesses, right? How do you manage that? Do you have a fixed number in your mind of what cash reserves can be? Or do you also let kind of market conditions, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick,","The discussion touches on the idea that fortunes can still be made even during a pandemic, and that there are always opportunities for people to pivot and adapt. The importance of carving out time for strategic thinking is emphasized, with the speaker sharing their own process of thinking time for an hour each day. They believe that it's crucial to focus on building wealth and not just making money, and they recommend that anyone should do the same. The discussion also highlights the importance of cash reserves in managing cash flow and capitalizing on buying opportunities during crises, such as in real estate, stocks, or cryptocurrencies. Overall, the conversation emphasizes the need for individuals to think deeply about their financial strategies and to adapt to changing market conditions."

That's a great question. So I usually my minimum standard you know I always there's a another mentor of mine that said you know usually we don't necessarily reach our highest aspirations in life we have minimum standards and that reflects our life basically and it's the same thing with money so my minimum standard has always been six months of living expenses for my my family our economy my business economy and then also my investment economy so that's all that's the the bare minimum if if it tickers below that then the alarm bells go off and I make sure it's over again but right now because there's so many manias you know in a lot of different asset clauses and within the asset cycle you know just look at real estate it's beyond the boom phase we're now in mania phase in a lot of this so you have to be very very weary as an investor so right now it's over 12 months so now my minimum standard I raised it to 12 months and I'm trying to get as much cash as possible now again most folks will listen to this and say well what about you know inflation what about the economy what about that market again you have to have a stable of horses doing different things for you because again we're marketed to in a maximalist way I have to put all my money in Bitcoin because the US dollars devaluing well what if Bitcoin falls to 55% right and if you had cash then you would be able to buy some more you would be in a good situation the same with you get the same conversation in the gold and silver crowd the commodity sector which I'm invested in as well you get the same conversation in the stock market you get every everyone kind of there's a lot of maximalists everywhere right now it's good to be diversified and especially with cash because the US dollar is still the world reserve currency and that's how you have to plan,"The discussion is about whether to save more money or invest it during the current economic cycle. The speaker's minimum standard for savings is six months of living expenses for their family, business, and investments. However, due to the current market manias, the speaker has increased their minimum standard to 12 months and is trying to accumulate as much cash as possible.

Do you say niche's or niches? Yeah, niche's and niches, yeah. For somebody who is starting out, and this kind of goes back to Robert Kiyosaki's book that made such a big impression on you early on, how do people have to change their mentality because in the US we have this consumerism is so strong and materialism. Yes. But I get the sense that you're really thinking about how do you deploy your money, how do you buy assets and not buying things that just for the sake of buying it. Like you don't need 50 shirts. No. No, it's so true because I think, yeah, there's a massive consumer mindset and I mean if you look at the saving rights, it's scary. Like is that how your mind works when you're walking out on the street? Yes. Are you looking around and looking for assets that you think might be underpriced that will grow? Yeah and I think of if we look at purchasing something or putting capital somewhere, I look at how do I find an asset that can pay for that because I don't want to pay for that. So I'll give an example. So my wife had student loans for example. So instead of just taking the cash and paying off the student loans, I'm like, well, we're not doing that. Let's find an asset that then generates income and provides tax advantages that pays the student loans off which we then were able to do because if you had the money and you had the student loans, it's gone. It's a wash but now you have the asset, you pay for the student loans and now the student loans are gone but you still have the asset. Did you find that in real estate or somewhere else? The energy market. So I found that in the energy market but there's other ways to do that but I always look at if I want to buy something, how do I get something else that can pay for that? You know, the nice thing about, you know, we spoke earlier about growing up in different parts of the world and you have a different perspective, you have a different mindset, you have a different worldview and paradigm. So, I mean, I grew up in South Africa and Africa in general, in parts of South Africa, there's a lot of poverty and you realize too when you grow up that, you know, and I'm still like that, I don't need all the stuff to be happy. There are other things that make me happier. So instead of spending on a lot of stuff, I'd rather, you know, play the game which I love playing games which is trying to find more assets to help me than buy other stuff. We all have desires. I mean, let's be honest, come on. You know, we're humans, that's how we were built, right? And I've lived in the US for 20 years, but it's discipline, it's hard work generating and doing this, it's not easy. It sounds easy when you talk about it, but the self-discipline and the delayed gratification, which is the hardest part of anything, whether it be a diet, whether it be relationships or whether it be money, if you can master that, you know, then you can build some walls.","The discussion is about personal finance and how to change the mindset from consumerism and materialism to buying assets that can generate income. The speaker talks about the importance of finding assets that can pay for themselves instead of just spending money on things. They give an example of using an asset in the energy market to pay off student loans instead of just paying them off directly. The speaker also emphasizes the need for self-discipline and delayed gratification to achieve financial goals. They attribute their mindset to growing up in a part of the world where poverty was prevalent, and they learned that they don't need all the stuff to be happy.

How did you do that? It's actually a direct investment in a company down in Texas that has a proprietary process of taking coal and putting it through distillation ovens and units and extracting the toxicity and some chemicals from it to generate a cleaner quote unquote type of coal. You can't clean coal even if you try, how hard you try. But it also then delivers a pharmaceutical grade type of oil and then you have the cleaner product and then you have different folks buying it. So it was a direct investment in a company that has a proprietary process. So the great part about that is essentially for folks that are familiar with oil and gas drilling, it could be great but you have to strike oil for it to be great. So exploratory drilling, although it has great tax benefits, sometimes folks can lose all of their money there. It's very risky because you still have to strike oil and drill oil in exploratory drilling. It's like finding the gold. Exactly. So what this company was able to do is they were able to structure a deal through their process that mimics essentially all of the parts of the oil and gas investment but you have the raw materials already and you have a supplier of that and you have an end user that you're selling the products to and then because you have the distillation units, you have equipment involved, there's significant depreciation of course through the tax code and so forth. It's an investment with great tax benefits but it also provides a steady stream of income. Sometimes in the energy sector, you're just saying a lot, the tax tail is wagging the dog because there's a lot of folks that say, oh, it's great. It's a great tax favorable investment but that doesn't help if you lose all of your money in that investment. Then the tax treatment isn't that great, right? Yeah, that's like when someone has a great investment that works out but they have to pay tax and nobody likes to pay tax. Right. But you say that's a pretty good scenario because the fact that you have to pay tax means that you had a big gain. Exactly. That's a good way. Exactly. You don't lose all your money. Make money and pay your taxes. It's funny that people are always, well, how can I make less money to do this? And it's like, no, no, no, no, no. You don't want to make more money. That's your first thing. Invest in stuff that appreciating value. Instead of trying to finagle the tax, get someone on your team on it that understand the tax code and understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand, understand,","The discussion is about energy investing and the couple's experience investing in a company in Texas that has a proprietary process of taking coal and producing a cleaner type of coal and pharmaceutical-grade oil. This investment provides steady income and has great tax benefits due to equipment depreciation. They compare this type of investment to oil and gas drilling, which can be risky because you have to strike oil, and the tax tail should not wag the dog, meaning that tax benefits should not be the sole reason for investing. The goal should be to make more money by investing in appreciating assets, and it's advisable to have someone on your team who understands the tax code."

I've started to think of it as it's a medium of exchange and I think that ties into the comment that I made earlier about the US dollar as the World Reserve currency. So money is a medium of representation of value. So when you just look at money and most people are stuck on that like oh it's money. It's not the money it's what it represents. So it's simply a medium of exchange. We can exchange goods and services with each other through the medium of money and it's a representation of value. So when you look at how money actually works there's a value equation right. So if you can go out and provide value to the marketplace through your skill sets and your capabilities the world responds by money coming towards you for the value that you provided to society and you do that from taking people from their current situation to a desired situation. So you know regardless of the business that's out there there are so many different businesses you know whether it's a problem that you have a pain point or a challenge or a desire or want. There's different markets right. So if you can figure out how to through your skill sets and capabilities provide value then you're gonna receive more of the medium of exchange and once you make that switch you're like oh wow. There's actually not a limited pie on this planet. The pie is actually unlimited because the more and more value we all create in the marketplace and exchange with each other the bigger and the bigger the pie gets. And by the way the reason why I'm in the United States is I got here 20 years ago and I saw the upward mobility in this country. I was just blown away you know growing up in in South Africa and Africa and traveling quite a bit you see you see it many parts of the world and when I got here I just looked at this and I'm like this is incredible you've got to be kidding me. There's not nothing stopping you you know your own efforts your creativity and your work ethic is all that you need and the sky's the limit and that's why you have all these you know stories in the United States where you have folks starting literally with nothing becoming millionaires and billionaires and by the way I still see it today and I think it's global because of the economy the this global interconnected economy that we have. So it's not just in the United States you have access to a smartphone and a connection to the internet. It's unlimited so yeah so it's definitely changed a lot over the past 20 years. It does seem that technology with technology just armed with an idea there's a very low barrier entry to starting a business so that there are opportunities and it doesn't take a lot of capital investment up front. You don't need to build a factory. Yes. You have a you could have like a used smartphone and suddenly have access to a very large market if you had a product to sell you could be selling something an Etsy or something like that. Yep. If we can if I can ask you to put your strategy or strategist hat back on for a moment since you talked about the dollar and I know that you look at blockchain and crypto does blockchain and crypto have the potential to change completely the idea of what money is and what people's relationship to money is and what happens to the dollar? Yeah I think it already has a little bit with with with Bitcoin. I think people you know Bitcoin started as this idea of you know it's a decentralized form of money. There's no central bank. There's no one person that has control over it and the market is essentially the the referee in this and as the adoption right grows and as more and more people start to use it and incorporate it the value of it increases and initially I mean it was basically you know people laughed at it you know look at it as Disney tokens and you know whatever you want to call everything that it was called but I think because they started to realize that wait a second I can not only is it is it is it a medium of exchange that is not controlled by a central bank or by a single person but there's actually utility of moving large sums of money from one place to another place. I mean you can move a large sums of money from your wallet to someone else's wallet without an intermediary like a bank. That provides a lot of utility to it so it has really gotten people to think and change their thinking about what money is and has I mean it really opened if it's one thing that it's done if it's opened the floodgates for people to think deeper actually about money and what what money is and we've seen now the adoption whether it was corporations now it's billionaires that are talking about it El Salvador just made it a legal tender there's other countries that that's looking to follow so there's already already an adoption is it going to take over the world and you know displace the dollar for example I don't think so I think that the central bank digital currencies is more likely where it's where it's headed and that's ready to roll out that's already been tested at MIT in the United States it's already been tested in China the European Union has already done a beta test on it they have white papers I mean folks can look this up online there's white papers all over about central bank digital currencies and central bank digital currencies is based on artificial intelligence another one of these things that words in terms that are scary in the fourth Industrial Revolution where cryptocurrencies is based on cryptography so I kind of see how this plays out you know if I had to put my my strategizing hat on and grab a crystal ball which by the way side note the crystal ball business is a tough one but if you have to look inside a crystal ball I can see eventually that central bank digital currencies would be adopted by governments and used within countries because governments have the power to enforce legal tender so they decide what's money essentially so I see crypto digital central bank digital currencies as it cryptocurrency yeah there's going to be a use for it and a use case it'll sort of mean be more like digital gold or store of value eventually in an aetherium will be like the S&P 500 index you know essentially or the app store is another good example of it where a lot of apps are built on top of this this platform but yeah I mean it's a very interesting time it definitely I mean it's really got people to think what is money actually how does it work who controls it you know what what is the use case for money how should it work I should it work I should it work I should it work I should it work I should it work I should it work,"The discussion revolves around the concept of money and how it represents value. The speaker believes that if one provides value to the marketplace through their skillsets and capabilities, they will receive more money in return. Technology has made it easy for anyone with an idea to start a business with low capital investment. The discussion then moves towards blockchain and cryptocurrency, which have already changed the idea of money, especially Bitcoin. Blockchain and cryptocurrency have opened the floodgates for people to think deeply about money and its representation. The speaker also believes that central bank digital currencies are more likely to take over the world and displace the dollar than cryptocurrencies."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uJBchCbc1M_sep_2830_3141,0uJBchCbc1M_sep_2830_3141,"Should it function? Yeah, it's incredible to think about the potential evolution of money because of digital currency. You alluded to the picks and shovel business and the fact that coins are very volatile. What is your view right now? How does blockchain or crypto fit into your sort of idea of trying to come up with different streams of income? Yes. Cash flow. How does it fit now? Yeah, so that's a great question. So there's a couple of different strategies as an investor that you can implement and execute in crypto. And I think that's very important for listeners to know too. One, and this is another lesson that I learned, you have to know when you save, you have to know when you invest, and you have to know when you speculate. And I preface that because some of the strategies is, you're putting your investor hat on and some of the strategies are you're putting your speculators hat on. So when you invest in something, you can directly invest in companies, blockchain companies. For example, there's a blockchain trust company that I invested in directly through a private placement. And then there's other ancillary, think about tax, crypto tax companies. You're gonna need that. There's gonna be a huge need. So as an investor, you can invest directly in a crypto tax company that provides the services that people are gonna need because it's gonna get very complex. And the rules keep changing. Who can stay ahead of everything in that just happening in crypto, right? It's treated as property. No, it's not. It's treated as this. No, it's, you know. So there's gonna be a lot of those needs. So that's the first thing in that space. Then there is a cashflow strategy in crypto too, where essentially, there's three coins that have gained utility value. So Bitcoin has gained utility because you can move large sums of capital from one place to another without an intermediary. Ethereum has gained utility because you can build things on top of that, such as smart contracts. So smart contracts is, I mean, a whole nother topic in conversation. And then there's a third coin which also gained utility value. It's stable coins. Now stable coins is just backed by another asset, whether it be gold, whether it be a basket of crypto, which is kind of funny, or whether it be the US dollar. So US dollar stable coins, there's a huge demand for it because like we said, the US dollar is still the reserve currency until it's not. And there's a massive need for it because if you have a lot of Bitcoin, for example, which a lot of folks got early, but you need to pay for living expenses somehow, well, how do you do that without triggering a massive tax event? Imagine you bought Bitcoin at 300 bucks. And now, at the time of recording, it's probably around 45, around there. And now you need money and you need to sell your Bitcoin, huge tax, so you can actually borrow on centralized exchanges, US dollars in stable coins. So there's a demand for that. And also traders, if you're trading in and out of the platform, people can move stable coins onto a trading platform. And when the price, for example, of a Bitcoin triggers their buy, they can move the stable coins in a Bitcoin. So it provides liquidity in the market, which you know in financial markets is key. So folks can actually stake their stable coins for cashflow and earn a very nice conservative return on it, paid monthly and annually. It's a great crypto cashflow strategy. And also what it provides is stability because let's just say you own some Bitcoin and Ethereum, you are invested directly into some businesses and you stake some stable coins for cashflow. Well, if the price of Bitcoin goes down 55%, like on the last pullback, you still have your investment in the businesses, which their value is probably increased because of the transaction volume has increased on the exchanges if you're invested in an exchange. But you still have your stable coins, which is just stable. It's still there. It doesn't have the volatility. Exactly, and it provides the cashflow. So when you think about crypto too, think about a strategy that works for you and think strategically like, okay, let's just say I put 2% of my net worth or my assets into crypto. Don't just close your eyes, grab a dart and throw it a dartboard. Be strategic, think of, okay, where do I wanna allocate it? Where's some upside potential? Bitcoin, for example, is like the digital gold. I mentioned Ethereum is like the S&P 500. This is not, of course, a recommendation. I'm just thinking through a strategy here and then investing directly into assets or and then investing for cashflow. So you have to think strategically about it of the different things that you can do to also provide some stability so that when it falls 55%, you don't get a heart attack. I like the idea. I like the idea. Why I like the idea? Why I like the idea?","The discussion is about the potential evolution of money due to digital currency, particularly blockchain and crypto. The speaker suggests that investors can implement different strategies in crypto, such as investing directly in blockchain companies, tax companies, or stable coins. Stable coins are backed by another asset, such as gold or the US dollar, and provide liquidity in the market, making them a good cash flow strategy. The speaker advises investors to be strategic and think about their allocation and potential upside before investing. They also recommend investing for stability to avoid heart attacks during market volatility."

It sounds like you're not saying not to speculate, but you better realize when you are speculating and control the amount that you're going to put towards that investment opportunity. A pretty significant part of your business and brand is educating people and helping people. And that goes back to your podcast, as well as the new book that's coming out. How does that make you feel, helping people? You know, it's giving back. A lot of this stuff is I wish these are the things that I would have known when I first got gotten started. And my philosophy, by the way, around this too, is we all think about, you know, our impact, right? There becomes a stage when you're like, what is my impact going to be? And for me, I've got two young children too. So I look at them and I think of, man, there's so much I still want to teach you guys. Because I don't want you guys to go through all the pain that I did, which is, you know, they need that too. I get that. But- Shortcuts are good. Yeah, but if I can provide some roadmap for them or some blueprint, what would that look like? So that was the thinking, you know, obviously I started my podcast before I had my kids. I just wanted to learn more from what there was to learn from folks. And now when we build Cashflow Ninja into this educational company, now it becomes, how do we give back? How do we share these and teach these things what we have learned over the past 20 years to provide an intellectual shortcut? You know, for example, how do we provide certain things that folks can follow and avoid some of the pitfalls? You know, what was the, Charlie Munger's got a great quote where he said, if you told me where I would die, I just wouldn't go there, you know? What essentially he was saying is- He's doing a good job of not going there. Yeah, exactly. Maybe somebody did tell him. But yeah, but essentially it's like the same thing with life and money and investing is, just tell me where all the pitfalls are and that's the stuff that I shouldn't do, the mistakes that other folks have made, and I won't go there. And that's kind of what we try to create and that's what we kind of teach. I'd like to ask all the inspired money guests, how do you define success? You know, it all depends on what your purpose is. I think success looks different for every single person, right, so success is defined by your vision that you have for yourself, your family, your community, your business, and then also your investments and the people involved with that. So, you know, success comes in different, when I look at success, I look at the different parts of my life, right? Having age-defying health, you know, would be success and I'm building towards that. Having soulful, meaning relationships and having deep connections and great friendships, that's successful for me. Having businesses that I'm involved with, that I'm passionate about, that I love working in. It doesn't really, like all this stuff is, it doesn't feel like work because I really enjoy doing what I do. I think that's success. Investments too is finding people with your values, your principles that are like-minded on the same journey as you partnering with them. That's success for me and that's been one of the great things about the different asset classes that I'm investing in. You know, I started being involved, being the person doing it, and then eventually, through hard knocks, I realized, wait a second, there's a better way to do this. I can actually find the best people in their niches, their niches that they're in and partner with them. That's been a lot of fun. And essentially, when people say, MC, you're invested in real estate, you're invested in energy, you're invested in crypto, you're invested, like, you cannot be like the, you know, you can't have it all down in every single niche and I said, no, I don't, but I have the people down and I enjoy the people and I love the people. I define that as success, you know, being invested in great project with...","The discussion touches on the importance of understanding the difference between investing and speculating in finance. The speaker emphasizes the value of educating people and helping them avoid pitfalls in their investment journey. The speaker's motivation for educating others is driven by a desire to give back and provide a blueprint for his children to follow to avoid the pain he experienced. The definition of success varies depending on an individual's purpose and vision. The speaker defines success as having age-defying health, soulful relationships, working in businesses that he enjoys, and investing in projects with like-minded people who share his values and principles."

It's not just, you know, like there are so many different layers and dimensions. I noticed that your Twitter account in all caps says money is no money is not mysterious. Yeah. Yeah, I, I, I really believe that. Like I think people, so I have a lot of friends who are artists and poets and writers and, and then I also know people, you know, from Wall Street and I really went out of my way to kind of have an anti Wall Street Wall Street firm. And so I'm really familiar with the two kind of extreme mindsets around money, right? There's one extreme that are kind of like the Ferengi and Star Trek, you know, very capitalism. And then the other extreme is, oh my God, you know, money is evil and everything else. And money is just, it's just a tangible representation of an energetic exchange. So anyway, I think I just went way off topic right there, but I really feel that there's, there's a lot of hangups around money and it's this mysterious thing, like how do you make it, how do you grow it? And it's like loaded. It's like powerful. It's either because it's evil or it's powerful because you really want it. And you know, it's like a hungry ghost. So it's either something to like be in opposition to and rebelling against, or it's something that you like, you know, can become so compelled to drawn to that it's, it's kind of unhealthy. So for me, money is just a thing and it's examining our relationship to what is that tangible representation of an exchange of energy mean to us because it's the emotions around it that are going to affect how you handle it and what it does for you too.","The discussion touches on the idea that handling money is not just about investing, but involves many layers and dimensions. The speaker believes that money is not mysterious and should not be seen as either evil or powerful, but rather as a tangible representation of an energetic exchange. The emotions around money are important and can affect how you handle it and what it does for you. The conversation emphasizes examining our relationship with money and how it affects us."

What has been your view on money? It sounds like not quite full-on capitalist, Wall Street, dog-eat-dog, but then it's not the artist, money doesn't matter either. Is it somewhere middle of the road? Yeah, I think the reason that I'm a good investor, well, there are a bunch of reasons why I'm a good investor, but I think one reason was that it wasn't super emotionally loaded for me. So what I mean by that, and I was thinking about this recently because I wrote, I posted an essay about this, is in 1987, I remember going home from Black Monday and I was living in the Upper West Side at the time. And I went home and I don't know, I lived around the corner from SABAR as I went to go get something to eat or something. And everyone, I saw these young guys walking around Broadway, the ties are askew, the hair is sticky, I mean, the shell shock, right? I had been, I was working for Chuck Rice at the time as a small cap value manager and he was buying money hand over fist. So occasionally we'd go look at the Quartron and go, wow. But the atmosphere in the office was completely calm. And it was only when I went out in the street that I realized that there had been an event that really shook people up. Right? And same thing in 2008, I think there were a lot of, I mean, I'd hear stories about managers who just went MIA, they went missing in action, like their clients couldn't get in touch with them, they just like were in some kind of, you know, they just were paralyzed. Right? And I really think what made me good is that I'm really comfortable with a lot of uncertainty and a lot of change and that you're constantly responding to change or you're, you know, you have to both, you have to have strong convictions weakly held, right? You have to have a strong point of view and a real case. But then if something comes in that tells you you're wrong, like you can't get egotistical about it, you're like, okay, I was wrong. You know, and you move on. So I think part of the reason that was good is I'm wired a little differently. You know, so I think people can also look, particularly when you're managing a lot of money, the dollars can get staggering. But so you have to really think in percentages too. You know, because if it's a 3% loss as opposed to $30 million, right, you've got a context to everything. So I think that was, that's one of the reasons. I mean, you know, there are many other ones, but I think that helped a lot. I'm a little wired a little differently. I speak very hyperbolically, but I invest pretty cold heartedly, I guess.","The discussion is about the guest's view on money and how it relates to their success as an investor in building a $2.5 billion money management business from scratch.

,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLiL6CYegRQ_sep_622_820,XLiL6CYegRQ_sep_622_820,"first met, I've really looked up to you for your very disciplined investing process. When there are days like Black Monday or a year like 2008, because small caps, your space, the pool that you swam in or you swim in, not for the faint of heart, those small caps are extremely volatile when there's a market crash. Yeah. How do you try to, like, how are you not as impacted as those guys with their ties askew walking down the street and they look like they've been hit by a bus? Like how do you kind of insulate yourself from that? So I think I was lucky in a couple of respects. One is that our clients were very sophisticated institutional investors and we were a very small part of their overall portfolio. So they had, and so I was hired to do something very, very specific and I was hired to do it over a long time horizon and I was hired to beat my benchmark. Right? So it was like if I did better than a Russell 2000, you know, so if the market was down 10% and if the Russell was down 10% and we were down 8, like we were heroes. So all of those things helped to kind of keep a long-term perspective on things. I think the other thing about small caps is smaller companies, and it was interesting because I was just sort of going over some data around the 2008, 2009. Small caps, you know, the overall market kind of bottomed in March of 2009. Like I think we all have been in this business line. I remember that moment. That was the bottom. March 9th on my birthday. Right. Yeah, mine is March 8th, I'm March 8th. So we're like almost birthday. But small caps bottomed in November. You can see that in the stats because everyone pitches out the small stuff. They hold on to like Apple, you know, and then when they give up on Apple is when, you know, like it's time to buy. So it's really interesting, but because it's a long-term thing and also smaller companies can be more nimble, they can act faster. So there are more opportunities to kind of for them to make hay while there's disarray in the world too. So part of it is, and I had a client who would always come to talk to me because, you know, whenever like the world was falling apart, I was so excited. And everybody else would be like, and so he, I was kind of his inverse barometer for the market because, you know, whenever things are really great, I'd be like, oh, I don't know, man. I don't know. A lot of things could go wrong, you know, but when things were terrible, I was so excited because I could buy a lot of stuff and I could buy it really well, you know. And that's not the time to be going further down below the barrel. You know, that's when you actually, you know, buy the thing that looks relatively more expensive, but as like twice the quality, right? So I think, I think part of it was just, was just because it meant so much opportunity, you know, because I really believe that, I mean, the times of the biggest dislocation are the times when you can make the most money. You know, and I know you knew that because you've been around the block a few times, a few times, a few times, a few times, a few times, a few times.","The discussion is about how to insulate oneself from market crashes, particularly in the small cap space. The speaker suggests that having sophisticated institutional investors who hire you for a very specific task and over a long time horizon helps keep a long-term perspective. Small companies can be more nimble and take advantage of opportunities during times of disarray. The speaker also believes that times of the biggest dislocation are when one can make the most money, and it's important to buy quality even if it looks relatively more expensive during those times."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLiL6CYegRQ_sep_824_950,XLiL6CYegRQ_sep_824_950,"In those times of market dislocation, do you tend to have cash available to deploy? So we had to run fully invested, which meant we really weren't meant to have more than 10% in cash at any given time. So, and the amount of cash was strictly a byproduct of our new idea of flow. So we're really running a pretty concentrated portfolio of no more than 35 stocks, you know, in no less than 25. And in practice, it was mainly around 30 to 33 stocks. And it was really a function of the cash was if we felt we had to sell more stuff because it was time to do that. And maybe before we had some new ideas, our cash balances would go up and down. But basically, we were running fully invested all the time. So it was because what happens, this is what happens if you're the freaking genius who like perfectly top takes the market and goes to 100% cash. And you time it perfectly. You're that perfect. That's pretty hard to top, right? You're not going to put it back to work in the market at the bottom. You know, you've been rewarded by putting it out. You know what I mean? It's kind of like you've won seven gold medals already. Now you just don't want to like jump back in the pool. OK, and make an investment decision because it ain't going to be as good as that one. You know, so I think that's what's interesting is in a way, on one hand, you could argue everyone's gone to like a fully invested buy and hold strategy. And really, maybe the value of the art would come in like doing some asset allocation decisions around that. But I think it's just too difficult. And, you know, I'm sure you've seen the research too, right? If you miss a few key days, like your returns are completely affected by that. It's much worse to be not in the pool and miss those big moves. You know, not to say that you can't be in the club and bear market for a long time, but there's usually like bear market rallies in there too. Sorry, Andy. I realize my propensity to like not give a short answer, give a short answer, give a short answer, give a short answer.","The discussion revolves around the idea of running a fully invested portfolio, where the amount of cash available is strictly a byproduct of new investment opportunities or the need to sell existing positions. The participants agree that timing the market perfectly is extremely difficult, and even if one could do it, it's not advisable to stay out of the market for too long, as missing a few key days could significantly impact returns. They also discuss the possibility of using asset allocation to add value to a buy-and-hold strategy but conclude that it is challenging to do so effectively."

And if you're going to actively manage, that means you have to be concentrated. And your stock beds need to matter. But I also didn't like having 10% positions. I just don't think, you know, you got to really think you're right. And whenever you're sure you're right is when you're guaranteed to be wrong, as you know, right? So every position was, you know, 3 to 5%, 6% tops, that kind of thing. So it was kind of really walking that line. And part of that I think I got in reaction to working with Chuck, who is a really great, you know, and has built an incredible business doing it. But I really like the intellectual challenge of like, really everything mattered all the time. And then from Andy Canuse, I really kind of learned, you know, that part of it, I guess I would say. More the sort of looking for the way to change and then the handicapping things and stuff as well. A little growthier. He's a little growthier than the Chuck. So I really developed my approach from old school apprenticeship, which I don't think is done so much anymore in our business. Because also, too, like I graduated in 1983. I mean, you know, sure, the people went to investment banking training programs, but it wasn't Wall Street, hedge fund, you know. It wasn't the ticket to like riches that people thought. So it was kind of a very different industry. Yeah, I see that fund flows and like things have changed a lot because there's quantitative trading. There's all this computer driven trading these days, electronic. And then also fund flows seem to all be going towards index funds. Yeah. And there's less talk about bottom up research and stock selection. Yeah, which is interesting because I remember I remember when value investors like I think it was around 2000, like right in the late 90s. And when like value investors were just leaving the business in drugs, they couldn't figure out the market. They couldn't figure out the market. It made no sense to them. Didn't pay it on eyeballs. You know, there are whole generations of money managers like quit. And so it's interesting because I think whenever you have an extreme, right, the opposite starts to matter. And I was reminded of this because I just bear with me. I was reading an article in the Chicago Tribune about how baseball was changed by moneyball, right, about very statistic and everything else. And so then the level of stolen bases went down. Pitchers weren't paying attention to it. The style of pitching changed. So it made it hard. So what happened is people started are starting to steal bases. Because everything was so optimized the other way, right. And that's what really created the opportunity because pitchers, the way they pitch makes it harder for the catcher to be able to like jump up and like throw somebody out. Pitchers aren't checking the runners the way they used to, you know. And so it really like there's a everybody following the numbers and doing the textbook way has created the opportunity for for for doing better. And I think I think that's what we're going to find possibly with when everything is indexed, right. Non indexing. And I really there's a lot, especially for sort of amateur investors, I would say. I think indexing makes so much sense. And I think if you want to learn how to invest and you can you can learn gradually putting a little bit of money to work in individual stocks that you believe in, or you can you can learn how to evaluate them. There's so much noise in the system though the signal to noise ratio from all that short term trading from the short term, you know. Everybody wants more return, but with less risk and with less fall. It just doesn't, you know, you can't do that. It just can't. So, you know, so I do feel like there were some there have been some real structural changes to the market and I wouldn't say it's. And I think the longer the better I think it's made it harder to hear the signal it's made for more opportunity. It also means like you really need stronger stomach, and you really need to be even more disciplined. And that longer term horizon can pay you well because I think at the end of the day. This isn't even with talking about crypto right at the end of the day. At the end of the day the cash flows of a company matter.","The discussion covers a range of topics related to finance and investing. The speaker emphasizes the importance of active management for investors who are paid for it, and that this requires a concentrated portfolio of stock positions that the investor truly believes in. They discuss how their approach to investing was developed through old-school apprenticeship, and how the industry has changed with the rise of quantitative and computer-driven trading, as well as the growing popularity of index funds. The speaker suggests that this has made it harder to find opportunities, but also presents a chance for investors who are willing to take a longer-term approach and focus on the cash flows of individual companies.

But at the end of the day, that is kind of the last, unless you decide it doesn't matter at all anymore, but that's a core principle of penance, right? That it's the cash flow. And all we're doing is trying to guess at what that number is gonna be at some point in time and whether it's discounted properly. I mean, it's a very messy and precise and kind of very theoretical exercise. But at the end of the day, what a company generates in cash flow should be what matters. So I think you get back to that. Yeah, the work that you were doing, it was also, it's like our Wall Street's estimates for that cash flow, for the earnings, for the revenue, was that being underestimated? And could you find opportunities where you felt like there was a lot more upside because it wasn't being recognized currently? Yeah, and I think also, I mean, we forget because we think numbers tell us that numbers are like a hard truth, right? But companies will have, managements will take a lot of actions or a landscape might change, right? And there's a lot of qualitative evidence that comes through before it actually translates into the numbers. And if you're a sell side analyst, right? Having to project, you know, right, crafting things. People by nature, we tend to sort of extrapolate linearly, right? And just kind of why take the career risk, right? Of saying, oh my God, they're gonna blow up their numbers this quarter. So I think it's really, particularly when there are inflection points, it's easy to find a way it's easy to underestimate. I mean, it's the same way that like market strategy, like no one ever is right about their predictions for the economy and stuff. These are complex dynamic systems. But I think if you couldn't find out that like, if you change how you pay your sales force, that they only get paid if the business is profitable, say, your profits are probably gonna go up. Your sales might go down because the sales are harder, right? And you kind of recover from that, the profit of the mix of your business is gonna be different. It's not in the numbers yet, but you can kind of handicap that what the effects could be. So that's the sort of thing that we would look for all the time. And then also too, like the street being, you know, sometimes you just gotta invest, you can't run a business quarter to quarter. That's the thing I think is like so sad. You really can't run the business quarter to quarter. And you certainly can't run the business to just make Wall Street happy and get cash in your stock options, right? It's just stupid, right? Because you have, you know, I think of a business like an ecosystem. So you have customers, you have vendors, right? You have your employees, right? You serve a lot of constituents. And I think Wall Street, I mean, I have really shifted this whole like, worshiping at the altar of shareholder value, right? Because if you maximize for shareholder value, if you maximize the certain like, you know, CFROI, return on investment case, you maximize for any one thing, right? You're gonna affect other things. And you can have huge value destroying, unintended consequences. They just happen to be a little further out in the future. Right? And so it was just driving me crazy because if you just take care of the shareholders, guess what? Your customers are gonna walk away. Your employees are gonna get pissed off. You know? It's not healthy. You gotta manage it in this way. So sorry, that was my soapbox, man. That is a delicate ecosystem and a lot of variables and a lot of things to juggle.","The discussion touches on the importance of cash flow in finance and how it is a core principle of penance. The focus should be on what a company generates in cash flow, and analysts try to estimate this figure and whether it's discounted properly. However, numbers only tell part of the story, and management can take actions that affect the company's financials, making it difficult for analysts to predict future performance. Additionally, running a business quarter to quarter isn't sustainable, and focusing solely on maximizing shareholder value can have unintended consequences and harm other stakeholders in the ecosystem. Managing a business is a delicate ecosystem with many variables and stakeholders to consider."

Are those things important to the average retail investor? Or maybe what are some of the things that you know that the average person can apply to their money and their investments? What are those important lessons that are meaningful to them that's not just important to an institutional mandate that's very specific? That's a really good question. If you're investing mattress money, money that you're really not going to need, this is money that you can put away for decades, finding the companies that are leaders in new technologies or new, yeah, I guess technologies. I mean, I'm thinking of like applied bio in 1990, when they made the PCR machines. It's just like you could see that there was a whole big industry that was coming behind it. Or like Genentech back in its day, or like Biotech, the early people were in the biotech. Sometimes when there's a new industry, like when cable first started, Wall Street didn't understand at all because the cash flow numbers were horrific. But the minute you had built out your infrastructure, it was going to be a cash cow. Crazy. But it was a new business model and people were like not being able to figure it out. So I think for a retail investor, when you're really looking out, take over the long term, finding the people who are doing new things and are doing it with a lot of momentum isn't quite the right word, but you can sort of tell that there's a flywheel effect, right? That Walmart at a certain point was just going to keep Walmarting its way across America. And I would say that, like paying attention to not trying to sort of find which oil and gas company is better right now, or which one has the best prospects or that kind of very inside baseball, but more like the bigger bets of is artificial intelligence going to make the difference. And I think that's the answer to the question, does it matter? Keep mattering more and more with every passing year. I think the answer is yes, right? So then you go and say, all right, well, who's doing that? And it matters almost less exactly how expensive it is because the market by time will take care of it to some extent, you know, and because you're making a bet on like which horse is going to win the race, but like 30 years out. Life cycles are companies are getting more compressed. Our world is just getting faster. So maybe it's not like I'm going to buy IBM and hold it forever. You see people who kind of grow up with that mindset. So I think that's what you do is and especially if it's an area or a field that you know something about and you are interested in and you kind of know reputationally what these, you know, who's crushing it in the market, in your industry. That's also another thing to do. But I would go for the for the. Not the new speculative kind of super cutting edge, but the ones were like the knife, you know, like the blade of the knife has been honed and it is cutting. It is cutting through the marketplace and changing things. So you don't need to be like right at the beginning. But I think I think I think so. That's what I would do as a retail investor today. You know, start to teach myself or be taught how to how to value things about things about stocks. But that would be what I would look for the kinds of things that are going to be the driven text tomorrow. The apples of tomorrow. Yeah, looking for mega trends and trying to identify who are the established players leading those big changes.","The discussion is about what knowledge is important for the average retail investor to have when it comes to investing in the stock market. The speaker suggests that instead of focusing on specific companies in industries like oil and gas, retail investors should look for companies that are leaders in new technologies and trends, like artificial intelligence, and have strong momentum or a ""flywheel effect"". These are the companies that are likely to be successful in the long term and provide a good return on investment. The speaker advises retail investors to pay attention to companies that are changing the marketplace and cutting through competition like the blade of a knife. It is also important for retail investors to learn how to value stocks and identify reputable companies in their chosen industry."

You know, it's so interesting because putting aside the whole blockchain and DeFi and decentralization, you know, the kind of empowerment of the individual versus institutions, and putting aside that because as we've all seen, it's not completely foolproof, right? But conceptually, in a way, as an investment, crypto is kind of a logical conclusion about all the structural changes that have gone on in the marketplace, right? Where the derivative of the derivative, like you get trades, people are trading not the derivative on the thing, right? But the derivative of the derivative of the derivative of the thing. So it's gotten to this absurd kind of level. And then you get back to this point. And I was reading an article, and I don't remember where, but talking about how for, you know, for a lot of the young people who are young, who are in a very different position in terms of like the level of student debt they have, about what their job prospects are like. I mean, you know, it's just it's a lot harder now, right? Because we're in this sort of mature economy. And, you know, they're like, what the hell? Like, why not treat it like a lottery ticket? Why not? Like, you know, because it's kind of like, it's not going to matter if I do like the textbook stuff. It's not going to matter as much. Why not? Why not take a flyer on some stuff? So in a way, all the stuff that's been happening, like, you know, since I started in the business in 83, right? All those trends. This is just a logical conclusion of that. Like, what is value anyway? You know, what does it mean? Like, how do you that, you know, like, what does it stand? You know, that kind of stuff. The whole idea, the other idea of it being a place for as a hyper-flesh-fairy hedge for people who live in countries who have lived experience of the wheelbarrows full of cash, like Venezuela, right? So, I mean, that's a real thing. So, you know, hyperinflation is not like, oh, that was just Germany between the World Wars. This is happening today. So I think the combination of that, the combination of having a system that is outside of the man, so to speak, right, has a lot of appeal. It just hasn't been completely foolproof. So I find it really fascinating. And I'm reading, I don't, I haven't done anything in crypto, but I'm learning, you know, and that's part of the fun of being in Twitter. My age is like, I can't learn from people. There's a lot going on. So I don't know. I don't know yet, but it's in a way, it seems to me perfectly, like, it doesn't surprise me that this is where we are, that it got invented. I'm in the same boat. I'm learning because I feel like there's so much to learn. And if you're trying to identify major trends over the next 20, 30 years, crypto and blockchain can certainly fit right in there. So you have to keep learning and doing your homework so that you understand what's happening. Yeah. And I think also, I mean, there are going to be more and more blockchain applications that make a lot of sense too. I mean, it just, yeah. The other thing too is I do know, I do know of someone who actually manages crypto assets the way you would manage a portfolio. So using that modern portfolio theory on crypto assets, which is kind of interesting. So, yeah, I actually would like to talk to you some more about that. You probably would too, actually. I would too.","The discussion briefly touched on crypto and its place in the finance world. The speaker noted that crypto is a logical conclusion of the structural changes that have occurred in the market, particularly in the derivatives market. They also mentioned that for younger people with high levels of student debt and fewer job prospects, treating crypto like a lottery ticket may be appealing. The appeal of crypto also lies in its decentralization and as a hedge against hyperinflation in certain countries. However, the speaker acknowledged that crypto has not been foolproof, but it is still a fascinating topic to learn about. The speakers expressed interest in learning more about crypto and its potential applications, particularly in the area of managing crypto assets like a portfolio using modern portfolio theory."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLiL6CYegRQ_sep_2225_2476,XLiL6CYegRQ_sep_2225_2476,"I saw one of your blog posts on your website and the title is, How to invest like a girl and beat the pants off the guys. Yeah. I have two daughters. Can you talk a little bit about that? Yeah, absolutely. And I wasn't just being click baby actually because what drives me crazy now is because I work with a lot of small business owners and a lot of them are women and they know so much more about money or they have like their lack of confidence relative to their competency is like manning. But like Vanguard and Fidelity both recently put out studies of their clientele. And there's always been this kind of and this the research has shown that women, broadly speaking, are better investors. And but like yet so many women say, I don't know anything about money. But, you know, the way we're socialized sometimes doesn't always help us. In this case, what was interesting to me about these latest studies is there's been kind of this notion that, oh, well, women are more risk averse than men. Turned out to not be the case at all. But here's where the edge came in. And this actually fits in with prior research. Women traded less often. So they not only traded like half as much and they checked their accounts far less often. So if there were like, I don't know, 24 percent of men checked their balances every day, like maybe 8 percent. So the women were taking the long term. They weren't making themselves crazy by going, I'm $10,000 more today. Oh, look, I made $5,000 today. You know, right. Because, I mean, because the more you pay attention to something, the more you're going to be tempted to mess with it. So so they would check it quarterly or less frequently. So part of it is they just traded less often. They were also more diversified, too. So they had a better their asset allocation was more was more balanced. So they used a bit more, you know, what do you call them, those funds, target date funds. They used a bit more balanced funds. They had more of a balance of fixed income. So it was less that they had cash and they had a little bit more fixed income, which right now you could argue could be more dangerous to the equities. But that's another that's another conversation. So they tended to be, you know, and they tended to. So they were more long term oriented. They were less by not checking all the time, less you're going to not make yourself fall prey to the common psychological traps again. And they were kind of well diversified, which meant that they could probably also create less, you know, volatility in their in their in their results than they would otherwise. So and the other thing is that, you know, there is still a gender gap in terms of the balances. And, you know, and what what what also really struck me is how many people wish they'd started earlier. Do you I think that's also like a beating message to get out there is is the power of compounding is real. Same way that debt compounding crush you starting smaller, just investing and just getting that habit can really pay off in the long haul. So, yeah, so so women are just they tend to do their homework. They are just less emotional, right? Much less emotional. And, you know, they're kind of more more disciplined. So I think basically that's kind of the answer to a lot of things is if you're disciplined about your approach and consistent and discipline and with a long term horizon, you're going to do well. You know, it almost matters less exactly what your style is and more that you're showing up and doing it consistently.","The discussion is about how women are better investors than men. Vanguard and Fidelity both conducted studies on their clients and found that women are more disciplined and less emotional when it comes to investing. Women traded less often and checked their accounts less frequently, which helped them take a long-term approach and avoid common psychological traps. They were also more diversified, which helped them create less volatility in their results. The power of compounding is also emphasized, as starting earlier and investing consistently can pay off in the long run. The key takeaway is that a disciplined and consistent approach with a long-term horizon is more important than the exact investment style."

It takes that rational side of your brain rather than shooting from the hip and say, I need this right now. Yeah. Yeah. No, I think that's part of it. And I think also, you know, I think you can't remove emotions from good decision making ever because, you know, so I have this thing because I have like one essay about like how like being like Spock is good and then another essay about how like not being like Spock is good. Because, you know, they've shown like people who have damaged a part of the brain where that removes the emotional part of decision making, like call it your gut, you know, instincts, make bad decisions, really bad decisions. Because you can make the logically sound decision that's a really bad decision and it's your judgment, your gut that tells you, no, that's a bad decision. On the other hand, if you're just reacting in the moment, right, if you don't have a plan, if you're just reacting in the moment or if like, you know, or just don't put me in it. Like I've seen people do this like with options or like a margin rather, you know, like stock, they have a stock tip and, you know, and it's so easy to like put money on margin and they're making money, they're making money and they feel like a million bucks, right? Boom, the earnings come out, the Spock tanks and they have, you know, stuff is sold out from under them because it's margined. It's not like they're like, OK, let me I can't average down or I'll recover in two years, right? Or, you know, it's just they're wiped out. It's. Yeah, so that's the emotional piece, because if you're not prepared for that, you're going to make stupid decisions and stupid decisions and stupid decisions.","The discussion touches on the importance of removing emotions from investing decisions. While it's essential to have a rational approach to investing, emotions cannot be entirely removed from decision-making. This is because gut instincts and emotional judgments can sometimes lead to better decisions than strictly logical reasoning. However, reacting in the moment without a plan or using leverage can lead to significant losses. Therefore, it's crucial to have a balance between rationality and emotions when making investment decisions."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLiL6CYegRQ_sep_2594_2943,XLiL6CYegRQ_sep_2594_2943,"You're going to make stupid decisions in a moment. I feel like when making a decision, you need to make a decision based on your brain, your heart. But you do need that gut check also. I interviewed a performance coach, Don Green, who would coach these Juilliard music students who would get so nervous for their auditions. And he also trained big Wall Street traders. And when it was the Wall Street traders, he was like, what was the difference between the guys and women who could trade with longevity? And they're making these huge bets. And he's like, they do all the research. They did the analytical work. But they also had to do the gut check because that instinct served them well. Because there's so much pattern recognition that your subconscious, 95% of our beings are powered by our unconscious mind, which takes in a lot and can see things. So it's the same. I mean, we've seen this time and again with experts on looking at fake artifacts or fake art. It looks wrong. And it's almost like it's not that they're going through a mental checklist necessarily, particularly if the forgery is really, really good. It's just it's off because the way it kind of vives off. But that's what the vying is like pattern recognition too. And the other thing, though, I've seen that can happen is people can do a lot of research and they get really stuck in their own heads about it. So these things were $13.22. They're not a penny less. And the market's telling you it's not worth $8. It doesn't matter how right your math is or whatever. The market is telling you something. It may be temporarily wrong in the market or you may be wrong. But if you're sure you're right, you're not going to bother to find out why. Because when you find out why with a truly open mind, beginner's mind, when you find out why, that's when you know whether you should be buying the bejesus out of it at $8 or whether you should be cutting your losses and running. But if you do it from the place of I'm right and the market's wrong, Mr. Market, as a friend of mine used to say, it's designed to give the maximum number of people the maximum amount of pain. So same way, if you fight reality, reality would always win. So sometimes I've seen people just get the collective mindset around something. It's just long. And I saw that in Pandora years and years ago. Everyone was so good. And they were going through a transition where they were becoming like a radio station in their business model, how they sold ads. So they had to invest in the sales force. They had to invest in this. They had to get the metrics to be able to sell ads the way that a radio station sells ads. And you were coming towards the end of that investment period. So all of a sudden, you were going to get rates. You were going to get local. And you had a lot of control over your geography in a way that you didn't in radio. So you could get premium for that. They were in their business model. They had to spend money to do this. But everyone was just so fixated on I don't know what the metric of the data. I can't remember exactly. But whether it was new subs or new screens or whatever. And I remember going to a meeting. And there had to be like 20 people in that meeting. And they were all short the stock. And they were all these hedge funds. They were all short the stock. And they're asking these questions six ways. You mean, you could just sort of see the stock position. But it was so clear what they were doing. And they were very explicit about what they were doing. And you either were like, does that make sense or does it not make sense? And sure enough, the minute the inflection point translated into the numbers, there was a huge pivot in the stock to go, right? But it was kind of a weird situation for me to be in where every single person in that room was short. And short, like hostile and nasty and short, that they were right. But at that moment in time, what was going on with Pandora was not what they were saying. Did you view that as a positive when everybody else in the room was so negative? Yeah, absolutely. Because it didn't take much to, if I had confidence that the numbers are going to fall out of bed. And they'd been doing this long enough that you were in the eighth inning. If this wasn't like you were just starting this process, you were long enough in it that you could put a time frame on it. You could size it. So it wasn't just sort of betting against the hordes just for the sake of it. I mean, there was an investment case around it. But you had to believe. I mean, you had to do that. But it was so interesting to me. Yeah, actually, when I think about it, it just made me feel more excited about the opportunity. Not that I like to necessarily go up against the barbarians. Everybody. But in that case, I really felt confident.","The discussion touches on decision-making in finance and how it involves both analytical work and intuition. The speaker mentions a performance coach who worked with Wall Street traders and taught them to trust their gut instincts. They also discuss how sometimes people can get too fixated on research and analysis and become stuck in their own heads. The speaker shares an example of a situation with Pandora, where everyone in a meeting was short on the stock, but the speaker was confident that the inflection point was going to translate into positive numbers, and this turned out to be the case. The discussion suggests that decision-making in finance involves a balance of analysis, intuition, and an openness to reality."

Let's jump right in. What's your earliest childhood memory of money? Well, I talk about in my own life, I've worked forever, what seems like. So when I was growing up, we rented an apartment above, it was a two family apartment, and the landlord was going out of town for vacation with his kids. And he paid me to scoop his dog's dog do around the yard. He paid me a little bit of money for that. So I think that was my first ever job in the world. And that's kind of, I would say, seven euros old at the time, six or seven. That's my earliest memory of earning money and sticking that in a little metal box that my dad got me. We didn't have a piggy bank, it was just a metal box. Well, I like the early willingness to work. And it seems like once you're scooping dog do for money, you can only go up from there. It is crazy. Nowadays, we just moved out of North Dallas pre-COVID. And I remember seeing the trucks that would drive around the neighborhood. It was a very, very large neighborhood. And nowadays, these guys would have the companies and the businesses that would show up at the neighbor's yard and scoop up their dog's mess. And that was like a legit business. And they always had the funny names on the side of the trucks, like doggy duty or something like that. And it's crazy. You can do anything for money nowadays. And points for creativity. Yeah, the naming of the business.","In this discussion, Scott talks about his earliest childhood memory of earning money, which was scooping dog poop for his landlord when he was six or seven years old. He was paid for this work and kept the money in a metal box given to him by his dad. The conversation also briefly touches on the idea of creative business names, such as those used by companies that scoop dog poop for a living."

You've called your sort of previous self a money moron. And I want to talk about your evolving definition of wealth. Sure. Like you talked a little bit about like that first job as a kid, but paint a picture of what life was like growing up. I think that was in Massachusetts. Like what money lessons did you get from your parents? I would say like most kids, none. None. You know, that was a dramatic pause there for silence. My dad, he worked for the town. Mom raised five kids. She was the youngest of five. So after my brothers and sisters moved away, she worked for a diner part time. And dad was blue collar, very, very small town. Nobody had any money except for the one attorney in town. That's all I remember is like everybody else kind of dressed the same, acted the same, did the same stuff except for the one daughter of the attorney. She always seemed like to have the nicest clothes in town. That was what I remembered. My parents never owned a home, always bought used cars, didn't have credit cards. My dad didn't have a 401k, he had a pension to the town. I got one lesson about money growing up and that was you should save your money. And being a kid, what I want to do like most kids, I just want to buy candy. And I remember how to ride my bike down to the candy store every day and buying candy and blowing it on skateboards and bicycles. So as soon as I got out of that town and got off to college, I was like, oh yeah, now I'm free. Now I can really blow some money. Well, saving is a pretty important lesson when you look at the like savings numbers in America, not that impressive. So at least that is something. It is, yes. So if you read the studies, which of course you do, people in their mid-40s have, well, they don't have two nickels to rub together, most people. And then people in their 50s, woefully unprepared for the retirement that they're going to be facing. And then you get the sadder stories of the people, you ask them, what's your retirement plan? Well, I'm just going to work till I'm dead. Not much of a plan and certainly not the way I want to live my life. You want to live your life or the people that we're trying to inspire around here on your show. That's not a great option, even though a lot of people accepted this truth. If you've got time, any amount of time, basic fundamental understanding of money and saving, you can have more than that. And there's better things out there for you.","The discussion is about the guest's childhood money memories and lessons. Growing up, the guest's family did not have much money and his parents taught him to save. However, he admits to spending money on candy and toys as a kid. The host highlights the importance of saving, particularly in light of low savings rates in America and many people being unprepared for retirement. The guest emphasizes the need for a basic understanding of money and saving, and encourages people to strive for better financial outcomes."

An outside observer might say that you succeeded, where your parents always rented. You were a young single guy out of school, you bought a house, you had a nice car. I had... You made it. Right. I think that's the perception that the media gives us and especially TV or unreality TV because I watch those shows too. I know what's going on with the Kardashians. It's the perception of, okay, on the outside, everything looks amazing. And you're right, I had a fancy car, I had lifestyle creep. Looking back on it is what that was. As my salary increased, as I got promoted, as I made more money, I got bigger apartments and then another bigger apartment. I was blowing all my money on rent and then buying a Porsche. The bank owned the Porsche. I mean, I paid the bank to drive it around, but I had an $800 a month car payment on that thing. So I looked successful and in reality, I did not have a dime to my name. Just paying money towards other people's debts, the people in the apartment complex and the bank for the car. And then for some strange reason, well, I know the reason. My co-worker came to me one day and said, Scott, I'm buying a house. And we're kind of on the same level of salary. And being a kid who grew up always living in an apartment in the same place until I went off to college, I never realized I could buy a house. It never even crossed my mind until she came to me one day and says, I'm buying a house. And then my mind automatically claimed, well, if you can buy a house, certainly I can buy a house because we're on the same level. And then I talked to my boss about it and he said, yeah, you should buy as much house as the bank will let you. And I took that as the gospel truth, not knowing about loans. So I went out and got the almost the biggest mortgage I possibly could. And so now I have a really expensive car and a really expensive mortgage and zero dollars in savings. And to compound that, I decided I should go out and finance furniture too, because that's the American way. Zero percent down. Yes. It was one of those no, no, no plans. Twelve months. Yeah. Now I tell people, no, no, no, don't get one of those. It's no payment, no money now, no interest for 12 months. And no, that's a that's a bad idea. It's funny because probably back around that time, like my my parents always taught me don't use credit, use cash, save your money. And it was sometime in the probably in late 90s, maybe early 2000s, my dad got fed up. He said, every time I go to the store, they're offering zero percent interest. I'm going to buy myself a giant TV because the savers are not being rewarded here. It's like I could afford it, but I'm going to take that TV and then pay it in 24 months. He's like, I'm going to take advantage of this and get the giant TV. But I guess if you do that too much, that becomes a problem. For people who are poor at money management, then yeah, that become a problem. Some people, they're very strategic and they will have the calendar out. Normally they're math nerds because they've worked it out. It's like, OK, I can have zero percent interest on this. I can make a point two five percent interest in my savings account. So if I do this after two years, I will have made like thirty five dollars. And for some people, that's like important to them. For me, it's like nowadays. No, I don't think I'll do that. I'll just pay for the cash. But yeah, it can certainly be workable. It's almost like credit card reward points. If you pay the credit cards off each month, you're going to charge that money anyways. And I've been in the never, never debt crowd. I my wife and I went credit card free for a period of time. It was great. Accumulated a bunch of cash. It's crazy how much you'll save when you get off credit cards. And now we're back to travel rewards, travel hacking. We're going to spend this money anyways, charge it to the credit card. And but we pay them off in full each month. So I think people can go through different stages depending on where you are in your situation and how disciplined and how your habits are with money. How big was this house that you were living in and filling up with furniture as a single guy, so single bachelor, three stories. It was 2000 square feet, 2200 furnished. And then the full basement, which was not built out yet, was unfinished. Had a beautiful backyard as a creek run into the backyard. I was beautiful. I look back on that house. I still, I still envy that you envy that you.","The discussion is about the speaker's personal experience with finances. Initially, he appeared successful with a good job, a fancy car, and living in bigger apartments. However, he was actually blowing all his money on rent and car payments, with zero savings. He then decided to buy a house and took out the biggest mortgage he could, as advised by his boss, without understanding loans. He also financed furniture with a no-interest plan. The speaker's father had also taken advantage of such deals to buy a TV. The discussion then touches on the use of credit cards and how it can save money, depending on one's discipline and habits. The house that the speaker bought was a 2000-square-foot, three-story house with a beautiful backyard."

I had my money awakening. I was a money moron. I got in the house and along with the house came a 40 minute commute each day to my job, which I didn't have before. I used to live a few miles away in an apartment. There on a billboard on the road to my job was an advertisement for a radio program by consumer advocate Clark Howard. I lived back in Atlanta and he's still on the radio today. I think he's approaching 70. So I just said, all right, I'm driving all this time. I'll tune into this guy. And he started talking about concepts I had never heard of in my life. Budgeting, emergency fund, investing, saving for the future, saving money around the house on heating bills. Since we're recording this in winter now and they're talking about 25% increases in home heating bills this winter. So even stuff back then resonated with me. Shopping around for insurance. I didn't know anything about that stuff. Paying cash for a car or buying a junker. And then he would talk about, if you don't have any savings, you don't have an emergency fund. And I learned about the no, no, no plan from after it already filled up the house of furniture. And it resonated with me. And I realized one day, holy cow, I am just an accident waiting to happen. I don't have a backup plan. I don't have any savings. I'm a single income. If I can't pay for this house, my parents don't have any money. Like I don't know what I'm going to do. And I made the almost instantaneous decision. It took me about a week because I got to get rid of this car. Unloaded it. Took a massive hit because I'd only owned it for about a year. So I lost a ton of money on it. But along with getting rid of that car, I got rid of an $800 a month car payment. And then I was able to go out and pay $6,350 for a used beat up junkie pickup truck. But I didn't have a car payment anymore. And then I just started throwing every spare dollar I could at my mortgage. And that was really, I say that that was almost the turning point in my financial life from, hey, we're free. We want to blow in everything on money and have no savings at all. Now I'm super frugal Scott. I'm not going to spend money on anything. I'm just going to get out of debt as quickly as I possibly can and pay down this house, which I put as little down as I possibly could. I possibly could. I possibly could. I possibly could. I possibly could.","The discussion is about a personal finance awakening experienced by the speaker after buying a house that came with a long commute. The speaker stumbled upon a radio program by consumer advocate Clark Howard that introduced them to concepts like budgeting, emergency funds, investing, and saving money. The speaker realized they were financially unprepared and made the decision to sell their expensive car and buy a used pickup truck to eliminate their car payment. They started throwing every spare dollar towards paying off their mortgage and became super frugal to get out of debt quickly. This experience was a turning point in their financial life from being a ""money moron"" to being financially responsible."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NscKRc9uA0_sep_822_1005,1NscKRc9uA0_sep_822_1005,"You kind of put yourself through this Clark Howard University, like educating yourself about money and I guess really redefining what wealth or financial happiness looks like for you. Were you drawn to the fact that I think that Clark retired at age 31 or something? Were you drawn to that? You're right on that story. He owned a travel business, sold it, and he was doing nothing. Got invited on the radio to do a travel show and that morphed into his personal finance show. And listening, I don't know what it was about him that resonated with me the most. We were both in Atlanta. He was very well respected and well known. I ended up working with a financial advisor later on and I think he put it best. He said, Clark is a straight shooter. He's not selling products. He doesn't take any endorsements. He's never done a single advertisement in his life because he had financial freedom and he had money so he didn't have to have those things to finance his own lifestyle. He was just out there doing his second act and helping people. And I think people like that, they're more trustworthy because they don't have any alternative material motive. You can do what I say or don't, but I'm going to go out and eat steak and lobster this weekend or not one way or the other. Your decisions may have no bearing on my life. I thought that was pretty cool. That's pretty drastic when you listen to a guy on the radio and you're willing to part with your Porsche and kind of eat the loss, right? Because I'm guessing it was a new car and the depreciation. How difficult was it to say, I'm selling this car. I'm going to lose X dollars. Oh, it was incredibly tough. I remember I put an ad wherever I ended up putting it. And the first people came and they showed up and they offered me way less than I was asking for. So I said, no. And then the next people came and showed up and they offered me even less. I said, man, that's a big hit. And I ended up taking the third offer on it, which was I think less than the previous two. So it was incredibly painful. I still miss that car. I mean, it was fun to drive. And so you have to be willing to make sacrifices in your life to have bigger things later on. And I share that with people who I'm coaching or talking to now. The same thing. We can't, Paula Pant, who's great, quote on this is like, you can't afford everything, but you can afford anything. Does that make sense? So you can have some cool things, but you just can't have every cool thing. And that was one of the cool things that I had to give up in order to have sanity, being able to sleep well at night and being able to have an emergency fund.","The discussion is about the speaker's financial journey and how they were inspired by Clark Howard, a financial guru who retired at age 31 and became a respected personal finance expert. The speaker was drawn to Clark's honesty and lack of alternative motives, as he didn't sell products or take endorsements. The speaker also talks about making sacrifices in order to have financial stability and advises others to prioritize their financial goals and make choices accordingly. This is exemplified by the speaker's decision to sell their Porsche, even at a loss, in order to have a better financial future."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NscKRc9uA0_sep_1006_1374,1NscKRc9uA0_sep_1006_1374,"I could continue to pay on this house. So it sounded like you sacrificed the car to pay down the mortgage debt so that you could build an emergency fund. I would imagine you can sleep a little bit better at night because you're not worried about losing your job or something going awry. Yeah, I like to say I traded in a car for a house. At what point do you move out of that house? When I met my future bride-to-be, which that would have been a few years later, which is interesting because after the next, I left that job that I was at and went to a new job. And I survived five rounds of layoffs at that job. The first round, half the company was asked to leave. And then the next round, I was in IT. It's like, all right, you got 50 developers and then now you've got 25. And then we went through another. Now you've got 12 developers. And then we were six. And at one point, there was like three or four of us. And there was a running joke after a couple of three rounds. It's like if a random meeting was called at any time and Scott was in the room, you were almost guaranteed to not get fired. I had made it through all these rounds of layoffs. And just some career advice for people that are listening. Show up five minutes early and be the last one out of the office. And it doesn't even matter what kind of job you do during the day. You can survive layoffs that round. It's just a perception of working. I did work hard, but it was just a perception that people had. So a few end up marrying meeting, marrying my wife, Katie. She lived in a townhouse, which was 45 minutes away, a couple of miles from where she worked. And at the time I was working from home, so I ended up selling my house and moving into her place just after we got married. This is very early on. Like there weren't blogs or podcasts that you could listen to, I don't think, about financial freedom. Just early for minimalism too, because knowing your story, you're kind of like the accidental minimalist pretty early on too. Yeah, we had books, we had radio programs, and then we had, I wouldn't really call them seminars. But occasionally, at least in Atlanta, I remember going to one of these shows, we'll call it, and Clark Howard spoke. I think Dave Ramsey was there and Sue Zorman. So the big three. And it was a three, four hour show. This is way early on before any of them were super huge, but they all spoke in regards to personal finance. And that's what we had to educate ourselves. Go out and read some books, listen to some radio programs, and that was kind of it. That's what we had to go on. There's no one you could talk to about money. No Facebook groups or anything like that, or YouTube videos. You had to kind of DIY it yourself and figure it out and see what worked for you. You're very transparent in sharing your own story, like the weaknesses, the mistakes that you've made. Do you think? Well, a couple of things stand out to me, and that's that you say that it's really common sense that a few simple steps can make all the difference. Also, anyone can do it, and it's never too late. Do you think your approach, especially in the early days, even now, like, is it extreme or is it just very small differences? So personal finance, what I've found out, and I've been in the industry myself now for eight years, and some of my views have changed during that time. I've been in the never, never debt crowd. I'm familiar with the OOPM crowd, other people's money, leverage everything, don't own anything yourself. And most people end up somewhere there in the middle. And we really have to put the personal back in personal finance because the cookie cutter advice that we've all been fed and are familiar with, it really doesn't work when you start working with people one on one. It's like, OK, I like this thing over here. It's almost like cooking. We could all go to the grocery store and pick out four frozen meals and live off those forever. But the first thing people do is, all right, I'm going to take this meal and then we're going to bring it home. Let me just throw a little Tabasco sauce on it as well. Or, you know what? I like this frozen meal, but it's got black olives. Let's take those and off. And they don't start following the plan. And my own views have morphed over the years of doing this. I used to be a particular way with debt and savings. And I've I guess I as I've grown, I paid more attention to what is most important in people's lives when it comes out to it. What makes you happy? And it's different for everybody. Some people, they want the freedom to travel. And that's really going to make them happy. Some people, they want to spend a lot of money on things like food. Some people, they want the freedom to travel. And that's really going to make them happy. Some people, they want to spend more time with their family. And that's going to make them happy. Some people are in killer careers and they can never see themselves retiring to anything else. And that's going to make them happy. It's different for everybody. And what I found, even looking back on my parents in my own upbringing, is we didn't talk about that. I don't think they knew what that was. I still don't think my mom, whose dad passed away, but mom knows what that is. And it's really hard to figure out too. Not going to do it on a weekend. Some people, it takes a decade. I'm still working on it myself. I've been on this journey for five years. And when you have some idea of what that is, I mean, that's really when the joy kicks in and then the finances are what? Support the poor, the poor, the poor, the poor, the poor, the poor, the poor, the poor, the poor, the poor, the poor.","The discussion revolves around personal finance and minimalism. The speaker talks about his personal experience of paying off his mortgage and sacrificing his car to build an emergency fund. He offers career advice to listeners, such as showing up early and leaving late, which can help them survive layoffs. He also talks about how he learned about personal finance before the rise of blogs and podcasts. The speaker emphasizes the importance of putting the ""personal"" back in personal finance, as there is no one-size-fits-all approach to achieving financial freedom. He believes that people should focus on what makes them happy and not follow cookie-cutter advice."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NscKRc9uA0_sep_1375_1869,1NscKRc9uA0_sep_1375_1869,"When it comes to contentment and that happiness, do you think that's changed a lot for you from like the 25 year old you versus today? Yes, and here's the reason back in my corporate life. So my friend who I had mentioned earlier, the one who said I'm going to buy a house. I used to be super selfish and super self centered and it was all about me. As most young people were Superman, superwoman were indestructible. And then at some point you realize, oh, my life is finite. I've got to take care of these other things. My health is going to deteriorate. And there are other things that are probably more important. So that was a shift in my life. I had been grinding it out for years. Dad came down with cancer. He got over it. Girlfriend of a long time dumped me. So it was like a dark time. I was like, man, this kind of sucks. So I ended up leaving corporate life, working for myself with a couple business partners in volunteering on Fridays at the Atlanta Botanical Gardens. Now I pull weeds. That was my thing. Friday mornings drive down there in an hour worth of traffic. Atlanta traffic is terrible. Hang around with a bunch of plants and then drive home in the afternoon. And from there, I started learning about time, what was important, having relationships and family and money wasn't so important anymore. Still was. I mean, you can't get by without it and can buy a lot of cool stuff and experiences. And for those who have families, it pays for stuff. But it wasn't the be all and all that I thought it would be. You know, in the past few years, it's turned into, it's not all about the toys and the cool stuff. Now it's more about the experiences and the travel. And I've got twin eight year olds. So what can I experience with them while they're young? Any parent would say, well, they're not going to be around forever. They're not going to be young forever. And that's true. So I want to have those experiences with them. And money is part of that, which supports it. Talk a little bit about that. Because I think many people are impressed that you became a millionaire at age 35. And I know that there was that transition from working for other people transitioning to owning different businesses of your own. But you say the focus wasn't really on the money. It was not I have an IT background. And I was a web person for software engineers slash web person. And I always worked hard because I liked what I do. Like, like what I did like what I do now too. And I would work 67 to eight. I remember my first job coming out of college. My backup plan was become a bartender because I couldn't get a job. So I went to bartending school. That's another important thing you should always know. So I did a job. I went to bartending school. That's another important thing you should always have a backup plan. I was running out of money after I graduated college because I only had so much saved. And my parents were going to support me. And same dumb mistake. So right out of college, I had a roommate, but we went and bought the most expensive apartment we could in Atlanta. Because it looked really, really nice. I didn't even have a job yet. He had he was making enough money his job that he could sign the lease for the both of us. Luckily, I ended up getting a job two miles away. So I was running out of money and got the bartending school as a backup plan, got my job. And then that first Saturday, I was so excited to be able to work. I was in there working, you know, a salary job. Just because I don't want to lose that job. I was worried that something will go south. So I ended up working a lot. And I apparently I rambled to the point where I forgot the original question. I was just trying to reconcile the becoming a millionaire at 35. And all the while the focus wasn't really the money. No, it was just on the work. And because I had such a hard work ethic, and I was learning and growing in that regards, I would get bumps and pay, I would get promoted at another company, they gave me more, well, both companies, they gave me small quantities of stock, it wasn't it wasn't groundbreaking. It wasn't anything that contributed significantly to achieving that milestone. But I call it the three legged stool that anyone can achieve. I don't like to discourage people because I was a business owner. And that contributed to some of that. It wasn't all of it. Because everyone in their minds is why I'm not going to be a business owner, I guess I can't do that. Totally not true. I can actually give you the numbers behind it in a second with a simple example. It's saving. So how much you're going to save, earning, how much you're going to earn, and then investing smartly is the third one. Because if you invest in dumb stuff, and I did that I lost $40,000, following bad investing advice back in those money moron days, as most of my retirement savings at the time, that's before age 25. And that's not a good way to go about that. But those three legged stool that everyone can achieve. So those three things, that's what the three legged stool comes from, can grow your wealth at a certain rate. For some people it's faster, for some people slower, it just depends on what they're doing. And for me it was okay, I'm single at the time later got married, we didn't have kids before we achieved that milestone. And with my in-laws for an entire year, my wife was out of work, she went to graduate school, this was 08 and 09, right before the great economic collapse. So she couldn't get a job, we had it in our brains, you know what we'll do, we will, we're in Atlanta, we will move to Texas, and we'll stay with your parents. We will stay with them for two weeks, because that's how long it's going to take you to find a job. And two weeks became an entire year of living in their spare bedroom paying $435 a month for the space to live there. We had no obligations at all at that time. So that entire year we were able to save 90, 95% of what I was making and she was doing a little side business. And again, that was just our journey. That's not to say, well, you got to go live with your in-laws and not live off anything for an entire year in order to achieve this millionaire status or a life. No, what I've done in the past when I share this with people is I use an example of a teacher married to a firefighter. I think I had them saving 7% or 8% of their respective incomes and then getting some type of company match of 3% or 4%. And I think if they did that using just average salaries in the United States, I think it was like 17 years using data from historical stock market returns, they'd have a million dollars in the bank. Average salaries, teacher married to a firefighter, 17 years and a very reasonable amount of savings with some type of match in there. So that's why you say anybody can do this. You don't have to be a business owner selling a company. No, totally not. And I find that very encouraging. That's one of the reasons I put that thing together because I just wanted to prove to people because everybody says, no, I mean, I didn't have encouraging parents. I didn't have discouraging parents either. But they certainly weren't the ones that said you can do anything you want in your life, Scott. They just kind of let me go about my way. And I'm trying to be very intentional with my own kids. And then for the adults that I'm trying to help on this financial dependence journey to, we've got to break through those mental barriers where they say, well, I can't do it because of X. And I've got thousands of examples and stories and successes and even that math example I just gave it. Well, you can do it because here's somebody who did, who was in a similar situation. Maybe they were their in-laws for an entire year or maybe they didn't wait to have kids, but they did that goal. Maybe it took them a little longer, a little quicker, a little quicker, a little quicker, a little quicker, a little quicker, a little quicker, a little quicker.","The person being interviewed talks about how his focus on happiness and contentment has shifted over time. He used to be very focused on himself, but when his father got cancer and his long-term girlfriend left him, he realized there were more important things in life. He left his corporate job and began working for himself and volunteering at a botanical garden. He learned that relationships, family, and experiences were more important than money. However, he still believes that money is important to support experiences and family. He became a millionaire at age 35 through hard work, earning more, and investing smartly. He suggests that anyone can achieve wealth by saving, earning, and investing wisely."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NscKRc9uA0_sep_1870_2037,1NscKRc9uA0_sep_1870_2037,"but it can be done. You wrote one book for children, money A to Z. What is it that you've been trying to teach your kids, you know, from birth to now they're eight years old, and they're twins. So this is a good experiment, right? Because I'm assuming it's not a one size fits all. As a parent, you're also trying to pay attention, engage like, what is each child's skill, and things that may bring them the contentment that you're talking about so that you can help guide them in the right direction. Right, so I've got one boy and one girl, and I wrote Money A to Z. It is a children's book. This is the basic alphabet of money, and I wrote that for them when they're just turning four. There wasn't any book on it on the market at the time, which you could read to a child of that age just to give them a simple vocabulary. And then I knew this awesome artist that I went to high school with who did all the illustrations. Very simple book. I wrote it for them, and at that time as a parent you start getting worried. What am I going to teach my kids about money? Because they don't teach it in schools. We know that from growing up, and the few schools that do offer something, it's not enough. I mean, money teaching in schools should be much, much broader than it is and more in depth. So with them, from the various earliest ages, we would have conversations. We would go out. I'd take them to the Home Depot or wherever and hand them the receipts so they could look at it, and they would ask questions like, wow, that's a lot. I had them there. We were at Lowe's last night because I was buying some stuff for a home project, and I gave my daughter the receipt. And she was like, wow, $55 for whatever we bought. That's a lot of money. Yes, that is a lot of money. Here's where that comes from. Here's why we work. We travel, and it can cost this much, and this is the reasons behind that. So we're, I don't say always having conversations, but we're having more than the average family about here's how much stuff costs. Here's how much you can earn doing different things. We have them. They've been working since they were five, I want to say, at little odds and end jobs, picking up sticks around the yard or washing the car. Good exercises. They don't get allowance. They get paid for doing work because any responsible adult, when they're older, they're going to have to work and they're going to have to get a job and get paid. So I want to instill those good values in my kids while they're young. Now, it is the ultimate experience. Are they going to turn out to be a bunch of boobs when they're 18 and blow it all? I have no idea. Just trying to hedge my bets right now. Right now. Right now. Right now. Right now.","The discussion is about a parent who wrote a book called Money A to Z to teach her children, who are now eight-year-old twins, about money from an early age. The parent believes that schools don't teach enough about money and that parents need to have conversations with their children about the value of money and the importance of work. The children have been doing odd jobs since they were five and get paid for their work instead of receiving an allowance. The parent hopes that these lessons will instill good values in the children and prepare them for responsible financial management in the future."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NscKRc9uA0_sep_2037_2579,1NscKRc9uA0_sep_2037_2579,"I'll do the best I can. I don't know how many businesses you've had since you struck out on your own, but what are your current income streams look like today? Sure, so I've had nine total companies, some with business partners, some by myself, some with my wife. My parents were not entrepreneurs and I had never intended to do that. My first one is a couple of guys were looking for a web designer. I said, we have no money to pay you, but we'll give you a part of the company. And then that's how I got started in business and I kind of liked it. And now I'm kind of spoiled because I work from home and have for almost 20 years. So the idea of going back and working for someone else, why they wouldn't hire me, I'm unhireable at this point. So today I've got, we have some rental homes. We purchased those after we had achieved financial independence. I just wanted something to diversify our income and give my wife some projects that she could work on managing the homes. And the other thing, as I coach and help people, I wanted to be able to speak more intelligently on renting homes and renovating homes. Well, the best way to do that is actually go out and do that. So we bought a few, that's one. We just started doing Airbnb with our vacation home. And this August, after we moved out, we've moved twice in the past year and a half because of COVID. So that's another income stream. I've got a financial planning business as well, started that in 2021. And that was a result of, I would get a lot of questions that I wasn't allowed to answer by the law regarding specific investment advice. So I went out and became a registered investment advisor so that I could provide that additional layer of help for those people that are seeking early financial independence. And then we've got our investments as well, which have been growing for nearly 20 years. I mean, that's a ton of compounding. We've had an amazing 10-year run, as most people who have stayed invested over the past 10 years, they didn't get scared in 08 and 09. When you have faith in the system, you stick with it, you can build wealth over the long-term. So if we need to pull some money out of there to pay for some stuff, we'll do that as well. My wife does some realtor stuff on the side. Again, it's a lifestyle business for her. She hasn't done much over the past year and a half because, again, we've moved a couple of times, so it's been harder. And kids are just starting to go to school. So we've got a lot of different income streams, and that comes from a healthy fear of running out of money in 50 years when you start thinking about all the healthcare costs and long-term care costs that get quoted in the media. There's some scary numbers. So I don't like the idea of touching the money that I've accumulated. I'd rather earn more than just live off of savings. So you're looking for, you have your investments which can be long-term compound growth. You have the Airbnb or some properties that can generate income. It sounds like good diversification. You're not on one extreme. There are a lot of gurus out there who find one way. And I don't know if it's for branding or if that's just a narrow vision, but they just see one way of doing things. And it sounds like you're willing to try different things. I try all kinds of stuff. And that's one of the things, as someone who's listened to Clark Howard over the years, the consumer advocate side, I like doing research for people when they have these questions and it may be a product or a service or this new thing. I invested in a franchise years ago, face planted, lost it all my money, but I'll try things here and there as long as it's not gonna torpedo the long-term plan and see what happens. But I also like simple. Airbnb is simple. Rental homes can be simple. Business is very hard, but I really enjoy what I do. So that's different for different people. Some people are in careers that they really enjoy. If that's your case, awesome. I mean, stick with that for as long as you can until you decide that you wanna do something else. I'm not of the mind of, thou shalt only invest in real estate and not have a 401k. I think that's really bad advice because later on in life, you may want these other buckets to pull money from that are taxable, tax-deferred. I mean, we can get into the crazy math stuff behind this as wise as you want that, just so you can pay less taxes 20, 30, 40, 50 years from now, or have those monies passed down to your next, another generation without the tax hits. Those are important things too. And you're right. The more diversification you have, it all comes down to one thing, choice. Choice and opportunity. If you don't have that diversification, you have very little choice. You have very little opportunity to seize an opportunity that might come up that you don't even know about because you haven't been presented with it. When you've got cash, freedom of time and schedule and all these different things, you can seize those and add more joy to life, add more fun, add more money. Who can say? It depends on what it is. As a business owner who has seen businesses succeed and some have failed, and also as an investor, how do you view risk or how do you manage risk? And I'm kind of curious, what happened with the franchise business? Sure. Let's talk on that first before we talk about risk. And they kind of tie in together. There's a movie out there starring Jack Black. It's called the School of Rock. It's one of my favorite movies, but I'm also playing music, so I like rock music and all that stuff too. But there's also a franchise out there called School of Rock. And there's, I would say about 200 worldwide. And I was a student there. My kids will be students there. Some that I think we've got 15 or so locations here in the Dallas area. So I knew a lot about the business, and I knew the owners, and I knew the people that worked there. And so I was in and out of that place for a couple, three years. And I just emailed one of the guys one day, I said, hey, what's the cost to invest in one of these? And he said, you don't have to work there. You can be an invisible investor, silent investor. You just put cash in, and it might make you some money long-term. So I put in 75 grand, enough that it wasn't going to torpedo anything. It was part of that quote unquote fun money. So if I was gonna lose it all in something that was high risk, hopefully higher return, it wasn't gonna blow up my entire plan. And then it didn't work out like five or six years later. They're like, this location is just trash. So sorry. Okay, I got a tax write-off now, and I got a very valuable lesson and a story that I can share with other people without being a silent investor in a franchise. I have been to the School of Rock performances, and those kids are incredible. They are, they're amazing. We did not have those growing up. So I was in a college band. We're just like, it's like a garage band, right? We sound awful more often than not. And I found that these kids who are going to School of Rock sounded incredible because they're actually getting good instruction. Yeah, they are. Play some amazing places too. Some of the venues, I was in the adult band, but I played amazing venues that you just don't get the opportunity to play if you're just in a pick-me-up band that plays around. And I played in plenty of dive bars too, but. So that was the investment that went south. When I'm viewing risk, I'm looking at here's everything I have to work with. I am willing to put this much money at risk as a portion of it all. And then you start weighing the returns. An example, all right, if you're a hard money lender, lending to someone who wants to renovate a house, you're probably going to get paid 10 or 12% versus somebody who's going to go into doing a franchise. Maybe they're trying to earn more than that. So I'm looking at that and I'm weighing that against what's the most I could lose. Sometimes it's a hundred percent of it. All right, if I lost all that money, what would it do to the rest of my lifestyle? A little bit, a lot. Would it blow up everything for the rest of my life? I never recommend anybody put your life savings in one thing and then hope it's a good plan. I just don't think that's a good idea because there's too many stories of people who do that and it doesn't work out. All we hear is the successes. If you're reading any of the business magazines. So-and-so and their best friend of 20 years maxed out $150,000 in credit cards to come up with this new seasoning sauce which got picked up by Costco and now they're bajillionaires. That's the exception, not the rule.","The speaker has had nine different businesses, some with business partners, some with his wife, and some by himself. His current income streams include rental homes, Airbnb, a financial planning business, investments, and his wife's work as a realtor. He values diversification and tries different things while also keeping it simple. He believes that having more diversification gives one more choice and opportunity. The speaker also advocates for investing in different buckets such as taxable and tax-deferred accounts to have more options in the future."

So many young people today get out of school with a lot of student debt. They're, you know, trying to land a job that will pay them enough to start paying that debt down. What do you tell the people that you help as far as debt versus investment? Debt versus investing and timing. Like how do you handle that? I think a great resource, and there's two camps, there's do you already have the student loan debt? Well, for people in that camp, you've got a certain amount of money that you have to pay each month. I love the stories of the people who they pick up side jobs and they just put their nose to the grind. Sometimes they tend to be single or haven't started families yet. And then working 80 or 90 or 100 hours a week to get these debts paid down as soon as possible. And I work those hours early on. It's a great time to do it. And then there's a camp of, well, we haven't gotten to college yet. What is the best way to pay for that? And the college scorecard, I think it's collegescorecard.gov. I know it's a government website. It's a great place. You start plugging in numbers and, okay, I want to go to this school located in this state. I want to pick this degree. And I know when I graduate in four years, this is the average salary I'm going to make. And it's a pretty good gauge of, all right, if I'm going to drop 200 grand on this fancy private university, but I'm going to come out only making 40 for this underwater basket weaving degree. As a parent, I would say, nope, nope, don't take out the student loans. And you're not going to get a parent plus loan either. Let's rethink that. Why don't we go to community college for a couple of years and get the core poetry classes out of the way before moving on to the major degree classes. And then I'm also, I think I'm just jaded as I get older as a parent. We've been sold such a bill of goods over the past 10 years about thou shall go to school and get a college education and you shall pay $150,000 for it. And I think, man, if my daughter would get a plumbing, that's not to be very, but become a plumber because of the trades, all the people that are retiring, she'd be a female owned plumber shop. And we've called it, I've even got the business name, we call it Girl Power Plumbing. And she would just rake in $150 an hour because all of the single women who were afraid to have these people come into their homes and work, they would call her. I mean, that's genius to me. I don't know if I can convince her to be a plumber though. So as I said, I'm kind of jaded these days. If my kids go out and start a business, if they go to trade school, if they go in the military for a few years, I actually would think I'd rather they not go to college the way some of the schools are turning out these useless degrees and saddling students with debt. Yeah, it sounds like a very practical approach. It'll be interesting to see what path our children take. And I think, again, it comes down to perception. It's like, what do they want versus what do they think that others view is? Right. It's like, if my son told me that he wants to become an electrician, deep down, I'm like, this is great. He's going to have like an opportunity to build a business. People need his service. And maybe he won't be saddled with $200,000 in debt. He's probably making 200 grand out of the gates after he finishes his internship, which is crazy. Exactly. Truck drivers, number one job in America. The average salary for a long haul truck driver is $120,000 a year right now. Truck drivers. That's insane. It goes a little bit back to the beginning of your story where you started. It's like you had the big house, you had a Porsche. People may view you as you succeeded, but today you're a millionaire. You're a business owner. You have multiple streams of income, but you're walking around in your Metallica shirt and people have no idea. Like, is our Scott and Katie successful? I don't know. I think it's funny and I joke about this with people. You can look rich on the outside and people you don't know might think that's cool. But what's cooler, here's what I'm driving. I have a 2007 Honda Fit. It's got 160,000 miles on it. It's the junkiest car usually when I'm pulling to the Walmart parking lot. And I want people to get to this mindset of don't pull into the parking lot looking at every people's cars. Pull into the parking lot in the back of your mind. No, you got so much money in the bank. You could go out and buy every single car in that parking lot with a stroke of a check. And that's what's going to bring you a good sense of being in your mind. Not to sound prideful or arrogant, but we should take comfort in knowing that, hey, I've got my financial house together. I don't have to drive that fancy Porsche in order for me to feel good about myself. I know I could go out and buy that if I wanted to. And I'll be content with my 2007 Honda Fit.","The discussion is about personal finance and how to handle student loan debt versus investing. The speaker recommends working hard to pay down debt as soon as possible and avoiding taking on more debt, especially for degrees with low earning potential. They suggest using the College Scorecard website to research schools and degree programs to determine if the investment in education is worth the cost. The speaker also suggests that there are other options besides college, such as trade school or starting a business. The conversation highlights the importance of avoiding the pressure to appear wealthy and instead focusing on having financial security and freedom."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NscKRc9uA0_sep_2931_3180,1NscKRc9uA0_sep_2931_3180,"It sounds like you want to be the millionaire next door. I know that you've read a lot of personal finance books. What are a couple of your favorites? Yeah, definitely the millionaire next door. I mean, that one is an eye opener. I think it's an eye opener for a lot of people and it's why it always shows up on the top 10 books of personal finance books. When you realize there's what the media and the advertising world portrays, how we should live our lives. And then there's the reality of if you want to have money, a comfortable retirement, spend more time with the family, sleep better, and these other things, which they don't really have in many commercials, except for the sleep number bed, because that's about a good night's sleep, but I digress. Those things, that is how you get by leaving this, I'm not even going to call it a frugal lifestyle because frugal gets such a bad rap. It's just an awareness lifestyle. What is important in my life to me about money and where it goes? And for me, obviously, if you're watching the video, it ain't clothes around here in this house and it ain't cars anymore. I love high style travel with my family. So that's why I divert my money and I spend less on other important things. And when you can get to that place where you're diverting more money to the more important stuff, it'll bring you more joy. Now outside of that book, let me think which else is on my bookshelf, which is the closet doors closed. I really liked, well, a lot of people say the Boglehead's Guide to Investing. That was one opener on beginning investing in index funds and how that all works and the math behind that. And outside of those, I'm trying to think, I have to go way back because it's been a while since I've read some of those classic books. That's one in two right there. If I think of a third one, I will pop it out. Those are great. I like to ask all the inspired money guests, how do you define success? I define it this way and I have for a few years, I get to do what I want, when I want, with who I want, how I want. I think that wraps into financial independence. I get to, yeah, my daughter's not going to be listening to the show. Sometimes I'm an OK parent. My daughter got nominated for student of the month. So next week, she's going to go get her award. That doesn't matter. The time of day, I get to show up at her award thing in the middle of the day at school because I have the flexibility of schedule to do that, which is cool. And we travel a lot. So going places during off season or off hours when other people aren't there just to avoid the crowds is a lot of fun. That's with when I want, who I want. So if we want to go travel with, I usually haul along my mother-in-law as an extra set of hands wherever we go, take her on her vacations with us and just cool things like that. Being able, and there's a huge portion of this is being generous. Time, money, talents, whatever it happens to be, a situation crops up. Somebody needs something. Here's a great example. The. Football coach for my kids football team, the head coach, he came down with COVID pneumonia on Christmas Day and he's in the hospital right now is recording this trying to recover. So the wife sent out the situation to our group text and my wife was like, I am going to Costco right now or the grocery stores. I'm going to go buy a bunch of food and I'm going to bring it over to them and give it to the neighbors so they can have it. So stuff like that, when that crops up and you can just drop a hat and go help out somebody. I mean, that's way cooler than a lot of useless stuff that's going to end up in a landfill someday or donate it. I love the definition of winning and we'll say a prayer for your kids football coach. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.","The discussion revolves around personal finance and the ""millionaire next door"" lifestyle. The person being interviewed mentions their favorite personal finance books, including ""The Millionaire Next Door"" and ""The Boglehead's Guide to Investing."" They emphasize the importance of diverting money towards things that bring more joy and fulfillment in life, such as high-style travel with family, instead of material possessions like clothes or cars. The definition of success, according to the interviewee, is having the freedom to do what they want, when they want, with whom they want, and being generous with their time, money, and talents.

It's my pleasure. Let's jump right in. What's your earliest childhood memory of money? I think I was about six or seven years old. I have an older brother, my oldest brother, who is ten years older. I wanted to buy this toy, I think a tank or something. And my parents wouldn't buy it for me. And my brother was going to buy it for me using his own money. And I remember it was like five rubles or something. And that's the first time I remember that money bought things. That made an impression. Yeah, it was in Soviet Russia at the time. And when you grow up in Soviet Russia, having money was not enough because you had to have connection to be able to buy things. It does not relate to my toy in this case. But in general, my parents had money, but there was no food in stores. So it didn't matter if you had money. You couldn't buy anything. You couldn't buy food. So yeah, when you grew up in the capitalistic society, money usually solves a lot of problems. Well, in Soviet Russia, it did not solve a lot of problems. It solved some of the problems, but not all of them. Thank you.","The discussion is about Vitaliy's childhood memory of money, which was when he was six or seven years old and wanted to buy a toy that his parents wouldn't buy for him. His older brother offered to buy it for him using his own money. This experience made an impression on Vitaliy because it was in Soviet Russia, where having money was not enough, as you also needed connections to be able to buy things. In general, money did not solve all problems in Soviet Russia, especially when it came to buying essential items like food, even if you had the money."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfzqFC653Js_sep_278_490,AfzqFC653Js_sep_278_490,"Vitaly, you're very thoughtful about investing. You've written four books and many, many newsletters. People keep trying to call a market bottom here. Where do you think we are in this financial market cycle? Oh, I have a good answer. From this point, and you have to write it down, this point, the market will either go up, down, or sideways. In all honesty, when you watch TV and you have these people who are extremely self-confident in telling you this is the bottom or market is going higher or going lower, they sound like they know the answer and they don't because nobody does. Market is, first of all, economy is a very complex system and it's incredibly difficult to know what the economy is going to do over the next three months, six months, a year. Try to figure out what the market is going to do. It's even more difficult because you have no idea how the market will react to the economy that you can't predict. You have to predict a reaction to something you can't know. You have to forecast the reaction to something you can't predict. I spend very little time thinking about what the market is going to do next. Well, each time is different. If you look at the market crashes, it's like 2000, you had speculation of internet companies, no valuation. 2008, we had a financial crisis. So each time is a little bit different. So you're correct. It's very challenging to try to predict because there are so many variables. Yeah. So there are certain things that kind of rhyme throughout history, like the dot com bubble in 1999 just repeated again last year. But you don't know when it's going to burst. I mean, you could have predicted it's going to burst three years ago and it didn't. So it's very difficult to predict these things. It's almost like one of the questions should not be asked by an investor because I think we are so much better off just, and that's what we do, is just focusing on value in individual companies and analyze individual companies. That is something where I would argue you can add value. But predicting what the market is going to do next, it consumes a huge amount of energy and I would argue your predictive power is very, very low. So that's why I don't ask this question. I guess if you think about it, I'm going to try to get a little bit philosophical about things. But it's very important to figure out what not to do as to what to do. By basically not doing certain things, you save a huge amount of energy. And that allows you to get, buys you time and energy to focus on something that you should be doing. So I would argue just don't focus on the market and just focus on individual stocks. And the time you save trying to predict what the market does, just put it to better use. Get a hobby, start skiing like you and I do.","In this discussion about finance, Vitaly emphasizes the difficulty of predicting the market cycle due to the complexity of the economy and the numerous variables involved. He advises investors to focus on analyzing individual companies rather than predicting market behavior. Vitaly suggests that by avoiding the question of market prediction, investors can save time and energy to focus on more productive pursuits, such as finding value in individual companies or pursuing hobbies."

What do you love about it? That's exactly what I love about this. Imagine it's a journey that has no end, a journey where you keep learning all the time and the learning process never ends. It never gets boring because I would be terrified if I was a doctor and I was specializing on the left knee replacement, if that's all I did. Because after a while, that just becomes a craft. It's a very important craft, don't get me wrong. I wish I had a doctor, if I needed ever, who specializes just on the replacement of the left knees. That person would be so good at this. I would be very thankful to him. But investing, there is an art and craft component to this. This art component is what basically makes it interesting and exciting. And a terrific learning experience. So that's what I love about the riddle.","Vitaliy, an investor and author, loves the intellectual challenge of investing and the fact that it is a journey without an end. He finds investing to be an art and a craft, which keeps it interesting and exciting. He compares investing to being a doctor who specializes in only left knee replacement, which becomes a craft over time. Vitaliy believes that investing is different because there is always something new to learn, and it never gets boring."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfzqFC653Js_sep_577_964,AfzqFC653Js_sep_577_964,"Can you give us a little insight into your process, like what it looks like when you have a new investment idea and you start doing the research? Sure. So new idea comes to me and something about this idea intrigues me. It's maybe the management or maybe the quality of the business, no matter what it is. I usually pull up a new report, start reading a new report. I may listen to some of the company's presentations. I try to look for interviews with the company's CEO, this kind of thing. So I do a lot of soft work first, trying to understand if I like the business. I may talk to some of my friends who may know something more about this industry than I do. Then I may read the expert research reports, like interviews with competitors of this company or people who used to work for the company. Every time it's going to be a little bit different because every time the company may arrive, the idea may arrive, come to me from different directions and therefore that will trigger how I look at it. Then at some point, I will talk to my analyst and I'll ask my analyst to focus on a specific issue. Then we'll start building a financial model. The more interested we get, the more deeper we're going to go. But at the end of it, we build financial models. We try to stress test the company's financials, its valuation. We would talk to competitors, we would talk to the management. A lot of times it depends how well I know the business. If we own something in the past, it's going to take me a lot less time to understand the business. Also, let me use this analogy on you. When you read sci-fi novels, one thing the author has to do has to build the world. Because in the sci-fi, it happens not in today's society, not in this world. It happens in a very different world. Now, when I own a company, an industry that's completely brand new to me, I have to build this world. I need to understand what drives this industry, what metrics I should be paying attention to, what are the competing products, these kind of things. It depends on the amount of work we do upfront. It's going to depend on how familiar we are with this company, this industry, etc. And how much world building we have to do. I like looking at a company's earnings stream. Usually, the foundation of my investing approach is that earnings matter. That if I can invest in a company, if I can identify and invest in companies that are delivering consistent earnings growth, the stock price should be correlated over time. What do you look for as far as being a value investor? Are you looking for the earnings? Are you looking for turnarounds? What kind of names do you like to find and own? I find investing is a lot more nuanced than the way you just described. Let me give you one example. You would think that the stock price would correlate with company's earnings growth. You are kind of right, except it really does make a difference how much you pay for those earnings. I will give you an example. My first two books focused on this issue. If you are listening to this podcast, I would encourage you to listen and read the little book of sideways markets. It's a very short book. It's going to take you five hours and 47 minutes to listen to it. If you bought Walmart in 1999, over the next 12 years, the Walmart grew earnings about 11% to 4% a year. You would think the stock price would follow the earnings. The stock price has basically gone nowhere for 12 years. Why? Because in 1999, Walmart was very expensive. The earnings growth, all it did is just compressed the very high valuations of Walmart's stock. The Walmart stock's valuation went at the time from 45 or 50 times earnings to 15. In the very, very, very long run, much longer run than most people have, the company's stock price will follow earnings. But it means that if you mindlessly buy in just on the premise, and I'm not saying you're doing this, but I'm saying that's the fallacy of that, if that's what you do, then you may subject yourself to decades of nothingness, even if you get the earnings right. To answer your question, what kind of companies do we usually buy? We buy high quality companies and we buy them cheap. If there is a turnaround, I have to be ecstatic about the management. And I'm not a big fan in general of turnarounds. It's not something we do a lot. There are exceptions, but the way we get turnarounds is that when we buy a company and we misjudge something and it becomes a turnaround. But in general, we try to stay away from turnarounds.","The speaker discusses their process for researching a new investment idea. They start by doing soft work to understand if they like the business, such as reading reports and listening to presentations, and talking to friends who may know more about the industry. Then they read expert research reports, build financial models, and stress test the company's financials and valuation. The speaker emphasizes that earnings matter and investing is nuanced. They give an example of Walmart, whose stock price did not follow earnings growth because the stock was expensive at the time. The speaker prefers to buy high-quality companies at a cheap price and is not a big fan of turnarounds."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfzqFC653Js_sep_965_1314,AfzqFC653Js_sep_965_1314,"but rarely. I just want to buy high quality companies and I want to buy when they're undervalued. Now, this is important. Is that, well, first of all, we need to define what quality means. What is quality? Well, quality is three things, okay? Kind of three general buckets. Business, balance sheet and management. Okay? Like what is a great business? I mean, there are so many ways to define it. But like Warren Buffett gave this very good definition. And that's it. It's not a definition, it's a test. A quality company you can buy and not be able to sell for 10 years. If the market, say stock market gets closed for 10 years and you can't sell it and you have no worry in the world about the business. So that's kind of definition of quality overall. But good business to us, company has competitive advantage, high return capital. It's run by good management. And good management, when we think about management, we're looking for two things. And those are two distinct analysis. How the management runs the business and how well they allocate capital. And then we also look at balance sheet. And again, this is a nuanced analysis as well because some companies should have no debt at all. Some companies- Hard to find nowadays. It's harder to find these days than it used to be. True, true. I think we're cheap money, right? Yeah, no, that's true, that's true. But let's say I would argue that a cable company can afford to have a lot more debt because of the high recurrence of revenues and because of low concentration with customers. I would argue that a retailer should have a lot less debt. Especially fashion retailer because the business is so much more cyclical, so much more fickle, and you're gonna have periods of times where the company makes from making a lot of money to losing money. And you need the balance sheet to survive through that. So again, it's a nuanced discussion because it's not a... It would be silly for me to say I don't buy companies that have any debt. Well, that's not... That would be a very dogmatic analysis on my part. Anyway, so that's kind of... And the last point is this. So we just talked about the business. Let's talk about valuation. So there is a... When you think about traditional value investors, and when I say traditional, kind of stereotypical value investors, they consider that those are people who buy companies that trade at eight to 10 times earnings. Well, I would argue that this is mischaracterization of value investing. Value investing is a lot more than that. This kind of analysis just focuses on earnings that are right in front of you, staring in your face. But what about a company that have a sustainable competitive advantage and has grown earnings at a very fast pace? And you are very comfortable that they can continue to do this for a period of time. Well, these companies will rarely look statistically cheap. But as you just described, if you buy this company at the right price, this earnings growth will create a lot of value. So in our analysis, we start this by looking at earnings four years out, always. Why do we do this? Because if I have a company that has a higher earnings growth and I'm comfortable with that, then this company, this capital I have, either buying this company will be competing with another company that may be growing earnings at a slower growth, a slower rate. And therefore, because I'm looking at four years out, these two companies will be competing against each other, and the company's growing earnings at a slower rate, it's gonna have to have a larger discount to its fair value to make it my portfolio. So it's a very nuanced discussion in general. So I own companies that look statistically cheap, staring you in the face, and I also look at companies that look statistically expensive, but we think they're undervalued because they are inexpensive, or they traded the discount based on their earnings four or five years out. It's very interesting. I suspect that there's quite a bit of overlap in the way that we look at companies, even though you get labeled as a value investor, and often I'm called growth at the right price. But I think that when you look at the analysis and what you wanna own, probably we're looking at a lot of the same metrics. It's just that the investment community wants to put everybody in a box, and they call something a little bit different. I actually, I would argue it's not investment community. It's an army of MBAs, consultants that need to justify the existence. So yeah. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.","The discussion is about investing in high-quality companies that are undervalued. Quality is defined by three things: business, balance sheet, and management. A great business has a competitive advantage, high return on capital, and good management. Good management is analyzed based on how they run the business and how well they allocate capital. The balance sheet is also important and needs to be analyzed based on the company's specific industry. Valuation is also nuanced and not just about buying companies at 8 to 10 times earnings. Companies with sustainable competitive advantages and fast earnings growth may not look statistically cheap, but can still create value if bought at the right price. The discussion also touches on the labeling of investors as either value or growth, and how there is often overlap in the way that companies are analyzed."

How does that make you a better investor and portfolio manager? Well, let's start with this, that this is not the only goal of my life. My goal for life is also to be a good, sense and human being. So it makes me a better human being first. But it does make me a better investor because it makes me... When you write something, it forces you to see the broken links in your thinking. So when you think you understand something, when you start writing it, you find that you didn't understand it as well as you thought you did. And you start identifying those broken logical links and you discover them through writing process. So it also makes me just a better human being because I tend to think more about issues than other people do just because I actively think two hours a day. That makes sense. I imagine that it makes you a better communicator too. Well, you'd be the judge. But yes, but in general, yes. And let me tell you why, because a lot of times when I'm asked a question or when I say something and I thought it through, I already have a logical link of what I want to say laid out. And when I wrote it, I already chose the words that precisely explain what I want to say. And therefore, it makes, for me at least, it makes communicating much easier. I would imagine that it would help a lot when you need to communicate with your clients or communicate with your wife. Yes, for sure. So yes, there's so many benefits to writing. One of them, there is a tremendous leverage, meaning that I write letters to clients. I spent almost like a few years ago, I was spending maybe on the high side, 30 hours a year talking to clients. Now the number is even less than that. And the reason for that, because I write very long letters to clients and in-depth letters. After they're done reading the letters, the letter describes them, what I think about the economy, what if you think about what we're doing, this kind of thing, and says, we bought Microsoft, here's why, we saw the IBM, here's why. It works through every decision we made in the portfolio. Once the clients are done reading this letter, they have no questions for me. Now my company has, I think we have about 300, 350 clients. If I had to talk to every client and explain what's going on in their accounts, et cetera, I would spend 700 hours a year. That's one third of my time. I spent a tiny, tiny, tiny fraction of that. So writing allows me to communicate at a much greater scale. If you double the number of clients, the amount of time I spend on communication with clients will not increase that much.","The discussion is about the benefits of writing for an investor and portfolio manager. The speaker explains that writing helps them become a better thinker and identify broken logical links in their understanding. Writing also helps them communicate more effectively, as they can articulate their thoughts clearly and precisely. This is particularly useful when communicating with clients, as the speaker can write long letters that answer all their questions and explain their investment decisions. This saves a significant amount of time compared to having individual conversations with each client. Overall, writing provides a leverage that allows the speaker to communicate at a greater scale and be a better investor and portfolio manager."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfzqFC653Js_sep_1548_1948,AfzqFC653Js_sep_1548_1948,"That's really cool. I want to talk about your new book, Soul in the Game. All right. Can you start by differentiating skin in the game versus soul in the game? Yeah. So first of all, my first, you said I wrote four books and I can see where you're coming from. So I wrote two books on investing, one tiny book about Tesla. That's the book you're counting. And then Soul in the Game, which I would argue it's an investment book, but it's an investment in your life, which is the most important investment you can make. So yes, so let me tell you the key chapter, like the title chapter of the book, Soul in the Game chapter. The idea for this concept came from Nassim Taleb. Nassim Taleb wrote this phenomenal book and he's one of my favorite authors and thinkers called Skin in the Game. In that book, and actually I have to talk to him about this actually, he had this chapter called Soul in the Game. And I don't know, to me it felt like it was throwaway chapter. It was unimportant. It was just there because he kind of liked the idea of it, but it was not essential to the book. To me, that was the most important chapter in the book, period. I read this chapter and I was stunned. So let's talk about Skin in the Game. Skin in the Game is basically when you share an upside and downside with your customers. I'll give you a few examples. I am in the investment industry. My industry is so good at having no skin in the game. Wall Street will create a product that is toxic, that they will never buy for their mother or for themselves, but they will sell it to you with a smile. They have absolutely no skin in the game. Now, I run an investment firm. I'm a portfolio manager. So I own the same stocks my clients do. So I enjoy not just the upside of us, my firm collecting the fees, but also the downside of my decisions when we make mistakes or just the market marks down our stocks. So my clients never have to question about if I have any conflicts of interest, if I was indifferent when I was making decisions on their behalf. Because again, all of my liquid net worth, and my wife and my kids and my brother invest in the same stocks they do. So that's kind of the Skin in the Game. But let me give you two more examples. One is in the old times when an engineer would build a bridge, after the bridge was built, he would stand under the bridge while the first car or whatever, carriage went over the bridge. Because the engineers wanted to make sure that people see that they have a skin in the game. It's almost like a perfect analogy, actually. Just remember this. Warren Buffett was asked, would he ensure SpaceX for going to Mars? And he had an interesting answer. He said there would be one price if Elon Musk was on board, and there would be another if he wasn't. And just think about this. I'm sure Elon Musk would work very hard to make sure that an astronaut would not die on his rocket to Mars. But it's almost impossible for him to care as much about an astronaut as he cares about himself. It's just our genetic programming. Or even worse, if it was one of his kids. Though he has so many of them. I'm not sure about this anymore. So that is what basically means having skin in the game. One last example. If you go to a restaurant and the chef does not want to eat his own soup, I would have questions. I'm not sure I want to consume food in this restaurant. One of the things I was thinking about, as you were saying, skin in the game and our industry not eating their own cooking, so to speak. When they drink the Kool-Aid, though, and they buy in to a really crappy product, that's when you have the financial crisis. When Subprime is safe and risk-free and all the banks owned it, then you have a financial problem. But I digress. That's a great point. That's a very good point. Actually, I was thinking about it. Yeah, that is a great point because at this point, they actually... So Warren Buffett tells this joke about oilmen dying and going to heaven. He gets to heaven and he's been told, listen, you actually been a good man and you deserve to go to heaven, but we are overbooked, so you have to go to hell. The oilman says, you know what? Are there any gatherings of other oilmen here right now? Maybe I can convince somebody to go to hell. They're like, you know what? Luck may have this oilman convention right now. So yeah. Because could I go talk to somebody at the oil convention? Maybe I'll convince somebody to go to hell and then I can take the place. And Sypatrch says, sure. I mean, whatever, not Sypatrch, whatever. The guy at the gate says, sure. Like, never happened before, but you can try. So this oilman goes to the convention and he says, hey guys, they found oil in hell. And there is this stampede people of Trump all over each other running to hell. And this guy is running after them. And the guy at the gate says, where are you going? He's like, but what if it's true? So the point is, like, you know, when talking about Kool-Aid, that's exactly, you know, that story describes it perfectly.","The discussion is about the book ""Soul in the Game,"" which is described as an investment book about investing in your life. The author discusses the concept of ""Skin in the Game,"" which means sharing an upside and downside with your customers. The author gives examples such as owning the same stocks as your clients in the investment industry, standing under a bridge after building it, and eating your own soup as a chef. The discussion also touches on the financial crisis and the problem of people in the industry not eating their own cooking, which can lead to catastrophic events."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfzqFC653Js_sep_1948_2313,AfzqFC653Js_sep_1948_2313,"Okay, so contrast the skin in the game versus soul in the game. And I want to bring up the fact that you cite your father as an example because art was his North Star, not money. Yeah. Well okay, soul in the game is kind of a, it's a mental framework of elevation of skin in the game. So skin in the game is a foundational concept. So you need to have skin in the game. But soul in the game is where, so let's define what is soul and what is game. Soul is an activity that basically fits into one of the three criterias, maybe a combination of three. You spend a lot of time in this activity, your profession, for instance. It's meaningful to you. And it has an impact on others. Okay, those three factors. So you don't have to have all three of them, but if it touches one of the three, then that defines the game. Okay. And you need to choose what is your game. How do you choose what the game is? Something you are incredibly passionate about. Something where money is secondary to you. So you would do this, like I would do what I do. I'm lucky I get paid for what I do, but I would do this even if I didn't get paid, or if I got paid a fraction of what I would get paid. Because money is secondary to me. So it's like investing for me or in writing. That's my game. That's something I absolutely love doing. It's part of my identity. And soul, when I say soul in a game, that's your attitude towards that game. It's inseparable from me. That's what soul in a game is, basically. And so my father, when you have soul in a game, you have sacred taboos. So my father is an artist and was a teacher. He taught at a university in Russia. And in Russia, bribery was like tipping a denis. Like I say, it was just part of your daily life. And so was Russia then. My father never took any bribes because he had taboos that he loved what he does so much that would violate his principles. Another example, my father never painted anything he was not passionate about. There was a guy who came and ordered a painting for him to paint. And my father was not interested in that. And even though at the time that would be a significant amount of money, that subject matter was not interested in him. So my father did not paint it as an example. You're in an enviable position. I mean, it's a blessing to be in a job, in a profession that you would do even if you got paid a fraction of the amount. I feel like there are so many people out there who don't like their job. They're not passionate about their job. Where do they go? Like, how do they pivot to figure out how can I follow a path of having soul in the game? Well, I think it's a very difficult situation. I think you have to be very careful upfront when you pick your career. So you don't do it for money. Like this is what I tell my kids. Money should not, like should be very secondary. You know, you want to make sure that you get, you're not starving. But outside of that, money should be secondary because if you just pick a job because of financial benefits, you're going to have a very miserable life. And then how much it pays, you're going to have a miserable, dull, uninteresting life. Now, I have a friend who, when he was 35 years old, he decided he doesn't want to be an engineer anymore. And he really wanted to become a dentist. He, you know, he basically, when he was, imagine 35 years old, he went to dental school, moved to California for three months, for three years, finished dental school. And now he is a very happy dentist. I mean, not everybody can do what he did. But I, you know, and I, and I'm looking at him and I looked at him as he was at the time, I looked at him as he was crazy. And now, but now I look at him as this incredible admiration. So I think you constantly have to keep looking for this. And if you're miserable with your job, if you can find where you have soul in the game and switch. I mean, it's, again, it's easier said than done, but it's, you know, it is doable and it's your life. And you only have one life. So, yeah. And even there are times when it may look on the surface like it's too late, but it may not be too late. There was a, there's a saying, but Confucius that I really, really love. We all have two lives. The second one starts when you realize you only have one. And that's, that's really, so everything you do, you want to keep it in the back of your mind that, if you spend eight hours a day doing something absolutely hate, that's a third of your one life. It's a good one. Good one. Good one.","The discussion covers the concepts of ""skin in the game"" and ""soul in the game"" in relation to finding a fulfilling career path. ""Skin in the game"" refers to having a personal investment or stake in an activity, while ""soul in the game"" is the mental framework of elevating skin in the game to an activity that is meaningful, impactful, and something that one is passionate about. The latter is inseparable from one's identity and has sacred taboos. Choosing a career path based solely on financial gain can lead to a miserable life, and it's crucial to find something that has soul in the game. One should be careful in picking their career upfront, and money should be secondary. Even if it seems too late, it's never too late to find soul in the game, as Confucius said, ""We all have two lives, the second one starts when you realize you only have one."""
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfzqFC653Js_sep_2314_2805,AfzqFC653Js_sep_2314_2805,"You've brought up several times how things were very different, or yeah, how things were very different in Soviet Russia. Can you contrast for us a little bit what it was like in Russia as a kid versus when you came to the United States? Because you do say that you were born in Russia, made in America. Yeah. Let's see. Okay. So, okay. So, let's start with how about freedom of speech? Everything in newspapers was censored. You did not hear about any crime because it was not reported. There was not in-your-face discrimination, but there was plenty of institutionalized discrimination. So, if you were Jewish, Georgian, or Armenian, or Tajik, you were kind of... Everybody looked at you as a second-class citizen. So, it was almost like a caste system. Like, it was not an official caste system, but it was almost like a caste system. There were very few choices. I grew up in this town, Murmansk, and it only had three universities. And these universities had a very narrow range of professions. Like, you could become a teacher, you could become a seaman, or forget something else. But it was very, very narrow. So, very few opportunities. There was an enormous amount of corruption. It's like people became successful a lot of times, not because of the merit, but because how well they navigated in this whole system of bribery and the system of corruption. So, it was a meritocracy, but merit was based on your skills in bribery and this kind of stuff. So, those are the things that come to mind. I mean, aside from the fact that my mom spent half of her day hunting for food in a grocery store because there was always a shortage of food. But that's what I remember about growing up in Soviet Russia. What was it like coming to the United States and seeing supersizing a Coke? So, it's kind of interesting. It's a huge contrast, right? You come from Russia to the United States, you go to the grocery store, and you realize some people drink Coke as it was water. And that's what I did the first three years I came to the United States. I consumed more Coke in the first three years in the United States than in the previous 19 years of my life in Russia. I mean, literally because until I came to the United States, I only tried Coke once. So, I usually talk about positive aspects of this, but let me actually flip this a little bit. So, the United States has a lot of abundance, which is good, but not always because this abundance I found could also be dangerous because just like I consumed a gallon of Coke every day, that's not good. And so, what happened was actually, let's talk about Coke for a second. I remember this day vividly. I was at a restaurant, Village Inn, and I ordered a third Coke. And I was drinking it and I realized that I was drinking Coke. And I was drinking it and I realized I can't taste the sweetness of it anymore because I've been drinking so much of it, my taste buds completely got obliterated. And it just tasted like water except it had a huge amount of sugar. And this is when I decided that I'm only going to drink Coke on big occasions. And I think, you know, when I go to the movie theater, which I go maybe two or three or four times a year, and I tell you this, every single time now I drink Coke, I enjoy it so much more. So, when we have the abundance, we get used to abundance very quickly. And we stop appreciating it. And also, material abundance, it gets even worse because then we become much realistic and we start looking for happiness in goods, in material things. And that happiness is very short-lived. And we go through what's called the hedonic adaptation. We get used to good things very quickly. So, as I got older, I started to appreciate, actually, my wife had this conversation a couple of days ago. And I read that Asian wisdom, but I think I also heard Michelangelo say the same thing, that the, I think it's a Buddhist thing, where the art, like when someone, you know, like in the Western culture, the art, you take a blank piece of paper and you create art on it. In Asian culture, and then the Buddhist wisdom is that the art is already there. So, when you look at the slab of stone, granite or marble, the art is already there. You just have to unveil it. So, I was talking to my wife about this because I said, we have so much art at home that we can create. And what I was referring to, we have so many goods that we can just get rid of and give away, just to create space. So, and I'm not even sure what the question I was answering, but I would argue that there is some volume of scarcity. You just got it from Marco Polo, who had to come from Asia, you know, Michelangelo. Yes, yeah, because Michelangelo said the same thing, but I also read that it's a Buddhist concept as well, so who knows. So, when you came to the United States, did you see it besides being this land of bottomless soda? Did you see it as the land of opportunity and just so different from where you came? Yeah, absolutely. I don't want to oversimplify it with soda. No, absolutely. I was lucky to be born in Russia and to be raised in America because I appreciated this country so much more. When you come from poor country, poor, corrupt country to United States, I appreciate this country so much more because I saw the contrast. I saw the opportunity I could have here, which I didn't have in Russia. So, I knew that if I work harder, and I had to work harder than everybody else because I didn't understand the culture, I didn't understand the language. But once I kind of acclimated, I would argue that it became my competitive advantage. You know, and I would argue that a lot of immigrants, and by the way, when I say this, I usually offend people who are born in this country and who are motivated as well. That's not what I'm trying to do. But as an immigrant, a lot of times people look at immigrants as they've been disadvantaged coming to this country. And I would argue, yes, maybe in the first year or two. But if they came from a poor country, I would argue that's actually an advantage, long term. Well, certainly it gives you motivation and grit and perseverance.","The discussion is between the interviewer and an interviewee who grew up in Soviet Russia and came to the United States as an adult. The interviewee talks about the differences in freedom of speech, institutionalized discrimination, limited opportunities, and corruption between the two countries. They also talk about the abundance of goods and how it can be dangerous because people stop appreciating it and start looking for happiness in material things. The interviewee sees the United States as a land of opportunity and appreciates it more because of their experience in Russia."

They had to make sacrifices and take jobs that were way below their education and their abilities. So, I wrote about this on Twitter today. So let's, I want to, I want to, this is thank you for this question because I think this is a very good question. When my, so we left Russia in 1991, the Soviet Union was collapsing. My father was afraid that the country will fall into a civil war or it's going to go back to the dictatorial regime of the past. So we came to, he said that he, you know, we came to United States for us. And that's what he did. For the next 10, 15, 20 years, it seemed like, you know, that the bad things he thought would happen did not happen because Russia was going towards a democracy. There was a lot more opportunity, et cetera. And my father made enormous sacrifice because he was a professor at university. He was extremely well known in Murmansk, very, very respected. And when he came to the United States, he was 58 years old, could not really learn language good enough to speak, like to teach. But he was lucky. He also had a hobby that he loved, painting. And if you look behind me, all these paintings are my father's and behind me. So what was interesting, so he, like when we were living in Russia, we were so concerned for him because he was giving up a lot and we were concerned that he would be miserable here. He was lucky that he found, like he was able to switch from one love to another love. My stepmom was not as fortunate because she was a doctor and she was 56 or something. So for her to become a doctor here was impossible. So she ended up working in a hotel and doing housekeeping. And my father felt very bad about that, actually. So he would come later in the day and would help my stepmom do housekeeping so she can take a break. That's, you know, that's my father. But anyway, this is where I was going with this. This is the point, like this, today I had this aha moment. I realized that what the sacrifice my father did 30 years ago when we left Russia, even though like it's today, it's so obvious how much it has benefited my family. Aside from me living in this great country, don't get me wrong, but I was thinking about I have a 21 year old son who if he lived in Russia today, he would have been conscripted to go to the Russian army and basically risk his life for what? And then also kill innocent, you know, he would be forced to kill innocent Ukrainians. And like if I lived in Russia, I hopefully would not be as brainwashed like everybody else. But then I don't know if I had the courage to speak up. And if I did, I'd probably be arrested and be in jail. So I am so glad that I'm, you know, for not just for me, but for my kids and my future and my grandkids and future generations that I'm growing up in this country, but not in Russia. And that's the, you know, that's, and I'm so thankful to my father and my stepmom for their sacrifice. So it gives you such a great sense of gratitude, it sounds like. Absolutely. Absolutely.","The discussion touches on the sacrifices that the speaker's father and stepmother had to make when they left Russia in 1991. The father was a well-respected professor in Russia, but had to take up painting as a hobby in the US as he couldn't speak English well enough to teach. The stepmother, who was a doctor, had to work in a hotel doing housekeeping. Despite the difficulties, the sacrifices made have paid off for the family, as they are now living in a country with more opportunities and freedoms. The speaker expresses gratitude to their father and stepmother for their sacrifices. However, the discussion doesn't contain any significant information related to finance."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfzqFC653Js_sep_3040_3394,AfzqFC653Js_sep_3040_3394,"Vitaly's Soul in the Game is really a collection of essays with the goal of how to live life. It's like an instruction book for life. And I understand that the subject of stoicism was a late addition to your book. How did you get into it? Thank you. Yeah, so this is true story. So the book was almost done. I think I was working literally in the last chapter. And I was going back and forth with my editor and we were basically done with the book. It's going to go into print probably in a few weeks or months or so. So it was almost done. And then I stumbled on stoic philosophy and it had such a huge impact on me. I emailed my editor and said, listen, I really want to explore this. I have no idea what's going to lead to, but let's just put the book on hold for now. Let me just work on this. And I think I probably took a break for six months or more and I started stoic philosophy nonstop. That was my kind of, other than managing money, that was my single focus. And I ended up writing two significant sections in a book. I mean, there's probably maybe one third of the book now dedicated to stoic philosophy. And that is the part of the book where I probably learned the most when I finished the book. You asked me what brought me to stoic philosophy. Epictetus. So let's first of all, let's define what is stoic philosophy. So philosophy, as intimidating as that word sound, all it means it's a love of wisdom. That's it. That's what philosophy is. When we think about philosophy in general, we think about this kind of granite sculptures of people whose names we can't pronounce, who have these elaborate sayings and we can't understand. Oh, stoic philosophy, yes, it's 2000 years old, started in Greece. And yes, there are statues of its founders that are marble, but it's such an accessible. I would argue, operating system for life. And what brought me to this, one of its founders is Epictetus, who was a slave. And he had this mental model or framework called the economy of control. And to simplify it, this whole economy of control, it's very simple. It says some things up to us, most things aren't. Okay, there's nothing, but I told you so far, there's absolutely nothing earth shattering in this except when you realize there are so few things that are up to us, so few things. It's basically, it's how we react, it's our values, it's our decisions. That's it. Everything else is not up to us. Andy, it's not up to us if you're not going to have continue, have a broadband right now and be able to finish this recording or not. Not up to us. It's not up to us when you drive home today that every light you're going to hit is going to be red or green, completely not up to you, not up to us. It's not up to us if you go to grocery store and the grocery clerk is going to be rude to us. Completely not up to us. What's up to us is how we react to this. And by the way, it's not up to you what your wife tells you tonight. Not up to you, again, what's up to you how you react to what your wife tells you. Okay, so I'm not trying to make it about you, but why not? It's all about me. Yeah, so once you recognize this, if it's not up to you, then you start reacting very differently. The only thing that's up to you how you react to things, you start going through life very differently. And if it's not up to you, if you have a red light when you drive home, then you might as well just go with the flow and accept the way it is. There's nothing you can do about this. You can get upset about it, but it's still not going to change. You can get upset, so you can be upset about the weather, but again, the weather is going to change, and that is what it is. So anyway, this is kind of how I got into stoic philosophy, and it's been an incredible journey. I feel like stoicism is gaining popularity. What do you think about Ryan Holiday's daily stoic? I think it's phenomenal. I think this is, my son uses that, and actually I get Ryan's emails all the time, and I think So this is important. Stoic philosophy, probably we should probably call it stoic practice. OK, the reason for this, because there is an Asian proverb, knowing and not doing is not knowing. If you know, if you read Ryan's books or my book about stoic philosophy, but you don't practice it, it's almost like you're not knowing it. Because with stoic philosophy, what you're trying to do, you're trying to reprogram your behavior, your habits that you have created for decades. So it requires a daily practice.","The discussion is about the author's book, ""Soul in the Game,"" which is a collection of essays about how to live life. The author added a section on stoic philosophy to the book after discovering it had a huge impact on him. Stoic philosophy is an accessible operating system for life, according to the author. One of its founders is Epictetus, who had a mental model called the economy of control, which states that some things are up to us, but most things are not. The only thing that is up to us is how we react to things. Stoic philosophy requires daily practice to reprogram behavior and habits. The author thinks Ryan Holiday's daily stoic is phenomenal and a great resource for practicing stoic philosophy."

I feel like we often feel that we've come so far because I have my smartphone, we're podcasting, we have broadband. We feel like so far removed from the ancient Romans and ancient Greece. But then you read about Stoicism and the writings and philosophies of these people. And in our 21st century, I still can't control my emotions or how I interpret external events. Like, we haven't come that far. I haven't evolved that far because all those writings still apply to what we do today. So this is what's so incredible about Stoic philosophy and incredible about when you read Seneca, Bacteus or Marcus Aurelius because you feel like they're writing for you today, even though it's been written 2000 years ago. So because we haven't changed. Like, it takes hundreds of thousands of years for us to change. And it's only 2000 years past. So what's interesting is that I remember reading Seneca's discussion about how we as humans get distracted by all these different things, how we can concentrate on one thing and we have all these interruptions. Remember, he was writing it 2000 years ago before Instagram, iPhone and Netflix. Right? He was writing it when Facebook was the carvings on a stone. So we haven't really changed. So when you read Stoic wisdom, you realize that it applies today as much as it did 2000 years ago. I want to read this passage from your book. It talks about the Stoics viewed money as an external advantage. The goal, however, is not to acquire as many external advantages as possible, but to use them wisely. When we think about wealth, the word that usually comes to mind is more. But the Stoics flip traditional wisdom upside down. Their insight is that once our basic needs are satisfied, the easiest way to create wealth is to want less. Can you talk about what you know about Stoicism and defining money? Yeah. No, I think that's to be honest, that you just summarized my whole thinking of the subject really that that that quoted. Yes, because that is exactly how Stoics approach it. I think I forget which one of them said that happiness comes from wanting what you have. And it's really up to you to decide what you want. Think about it. It's your choice. It's your choice to decide what you want. And a lot of times, we mindlessly decide to want what our neighbors have. And then we get into this rat race of trying to get more and more and more and own have what our neighbors have. And that's going to lead to life of misery because you're going to spend a lot of time working very, very hard to accumulate things. That's going to bring you very little satisfaction. As I got older, as I mentioned, I find a lot less like I'm actually more minimalist, like not quite. But I found that I enjoy material things less, less and less. And I want to have a simple life. I was talking to a friend who just bought a house in Florida and he was raving about this. And I told him I have so little desire to have a second home in Florida, because now I have to think about hurricanes and flood insurance and whatever other things he has to worry about. And I'll just be very happy to use Airbnb just to keep my life simple. By the way, there is a lot of value in simplicity as well. So value, so money is, so more money does not bring you happiness. After we get above a certain level of income, the incremental dollar does not make us any happier. Money does by security. But again, it doesn't even matter how much money you make. Like how much money you make in itself is not as important. It's a multivariable equation. How about this? Your wealth is really, it's really just your income minus your expenses and then accumulated over the years. So either you make it 100,000 dollars and spend 60 or you make 5 million dollars and spend seven. You will be wealthier at the end when you make 100,000 dollars and spend 60 because you're going to keep saving 40,000 dollars a year and you're going to invest over a period of time. It's going to compound and then you're going to accumulate wealth. So wanting to make more money, making more money, that's usually how we look at our solving problems. It's not, it's actually maybe part of a solution where another part of the solution we usually ignore is to be mindful about how we spend money and actually wanting what we buy. I think that's a good point. I think that's a good point. Why? Well, we live in such a material world that we find that if you look around your house, I could get rid of most of the things in my house and I wouldn't miss a lot of them. Like if I only kept the things that really mean something to me or have a utility, I could probably reduce things, 70% of my stuff and I'd be okay. I'd probably be happier. Exactly. As I told you before, this is what my wife and I, now we approach our house as an art project where we are trying to create art at home by getting rid of half of our possessions. And honest to God, I think it's just going to, you know, it's actually going to bring us happiness because we won't be stumbling through 20 different dishes to get to one. So yeah, there is a lot of value in simplicity and not being burdened by a lot of things.","The discussion is about Stoic philosophy and money. The speaker believes that Stoic philosophy applies today as much as it did 2000 years ago because humans have not changed much in terms of emotions and how they interpret external events. Stoics view money as an external advantage, but the goal is not to acquire as many external advantages as possible, but to use them wisely. The easiest way to create wealth is to want less once basic needs are satisfied. Happiness comes from wanting what one has, and people should be mindful of how they spend money and actually want what they buy. The speaker believes that there is value in simplicity and that one can accumulate wealth by saving money and investing it over time. The speaker and his wife approach their house as an art project by getting rid of half of their possessions, which they believe will bring them happiness."

Can you talk about why you're most impressed by Marcus Aurelius? Oh yeah. So if you ask me who would I want to have lunch, dinner or life, it would be Marcus Aurelius. Because every stoic, like, you know, Victitius impresses me because he was a slave and yet he had so much wisdom. Seneca was this Renaissance man centuries before Renaissance. But Marcus Aurelius, and by the way, all of them have so much wisdom. So every single one of them has this wealth of knowledge. So I don't want to take away from any one of them except Marcus Aurelius was the wealthiest, the most powerful man in the Western world at the time. He had unlimited power, unlimited wealth, and yet he did not let that wealth and power him, which is an incredible, incredible test. Because what happens with power, sometimes you start taking shortcuts. Let me give you an example, and it's not a perfect example, but let's take Putin, for example, okay? And I'm going to give him a benefit of the doubt a little bit. So maybe when he came to power, he was actually, I read interviews with people who knew him, he was actually kind of, even though he came from KGB, he was somewhat democratic values to some of you. He wanted to have democratic values. But over time, and he argued that for him to achieve this, he needed more power. And I get this because when he came, Russia was very corrupt. And so there was a lot of local elected leaders who were very corrupt. So he figured he needed to centralize his power to get rid of corruption. So he asked for more power from Russian citizens, and they said, we get it, we'll give it to you. Then he asked for more power and more power. And then what happens is that, let's say you want to accomplish something, and the democratic process is too slow, or it may actually not cooperate with you. So you start taking shortcuts, because you're doing it for the good of the people, right? This is how you convince yourself. Every shortcut you take, you become a little more corrupt. You just don't realize it. You start abusing power a little bit more. And at some point it gets to the point where all you're trying to do is just to preserve that power you have, because now you're addicted to it. So Marcus Aurelius, it was like Putin on steroids because he was given unlimited amount of power from day one, and he still behaved, he never abused it. And to me, that's the biggest test. He'd been subjected to one of the biggest tests ever. It's a bigger test than poverty. And he passed it. Yeah, it's a rare individual who can pass that test. I'd like to ask all the inspired money guests, how do you define success? I think it's a relative for everybody. For me, it's basically living a meaningful life, being kind to people, just basically living according to my values, basically. That's for me, success. When I look in the mirror and I like the person I see, that's a success. I mean, I'm not like how much hair I have, but that's not what I'm talking about. I just respect the person I see in the mirror.","The discussion touches on the topic of Stoicism and its notable figures, including Marcus Aurelius, who was the wealthiest and most powerful man in the Western world at the time. Despite his unlimited power and wealth, Marcus Aurelius did not let them control him, which is an incredible feat. The conversation draws a comparison with Putin, who started with democratic values but took shortcuts and abused power over time. Success is defined as living a meaningful life, being kind to people, and living according to one's values."

One is, so I'm a first generation immigrant. My parents brought me here when I was seven or so. And one of the first kind of memories was, you know, we're dead center, kind of middle class. And we were very frugal kind of growing up. So I still remember when we would always do the price matching for anything in the grocery stores. And we would kind of take a bus for 20 to 30 minutes just because the bananas were cheaper by four cents in one than the other. That was probably the first very strong memory that kind of stuck to me. The second one is probably related to when I kind of got a first taste because I guess growing up in an Asian household, allowances for some reason wasn't really a thing. So I didn't really get to touch or use money up until kind of much later when I had my first kind of like paper route job, if you will, and earned a bit from that. With the price matching growing up with that, is that something that you carry with you? Or is that something that you eventually like let go? It's that, all right, I don't need to do that anymore. Yeah, I don't think I don't, I don't, I don't price match anymore. I don't, I don't kind of go around shopping for the cheapest bananas. But I do find myself still very much of the frugal mindset. Like I don't go out of my way to find, compare kind of flyers for that particular case. But very much my head is always thinking about, you know, for example, even if I were to have a house, instead of living in myself, I'm like, I could kind of arbitrage that by renting somewhere cheaper, I would do that any day of the week. So very much that's still kind of in my, in my first day, I think about when I think about a car, I think about depreciating assets. And I'm like, so that's very much how I think about things. So money's on your mind. Yes, very much so. So growing up in this middle class immigrant family, did you ever imagine becoming an entrepreneur or founding a fast growing startup? Never, not until I didn't even know startup was a startup or entrepreneurship was a possible career path or something you could make something like spend your life doing up until probably, my first taste of it was my junior year in college, I think up until that. So growing up, both my parents worked in the government. They've been, you know, worked really hard their whole lives. Same job for the last 20 plus years, right? So very much my mentality growing up was that more traditional, find a stable job, get a good income, buy a house, that kind of mindset. And yeah, didn't think about, didn't know for a while. I didn't know better until my junior year of college. When did that start to change? I mean, or how did that start to change? I think it was by, it was very serendipitous. And I have a lot of people along the way to thank for and in particular, it was kind of that, whether it's peers of mine or people I looked up to, who were might have been a few years older than me, or might have been a decade older than me, that kind of people I love to look up to as mentors or people I want to emulate. And I think it made me start to realize that, A, that they were doing something like that, that they were building a company of their own, and that's something that's possible. And B, that a lot of things, I think this is a Steve Jobs quote, but a lot of things that we see around us are just made by other people, right? It's not like it was, it kind of came out of thin air, or it was invented, or it was created, or it was built by other people. And I've always kind of been someone that liked building or tinkering with things. So I kind of learned coding on my own as a kid, learned to build my own websites. I just didn't know that was actually applied to any sort of career or making money out of it too much later. Any clues of this interest in business as a kid? Like, were you selling candy or anything? I was much more of a, I guess, a builder. So I was, I remember when I, one of my early memories of kind of coding something up or building something was, I love video games. I still play a lot of video games, but growing up in a strict Asian family, I was not allowed to play video games. So I always tried to figure out ways that I could. So my first kind of reason to program was I programmed a bot that helped me play video games when I was at school. So I would leave the computer on running and play video games for me. And I go to school pretending I didn't play video games, or my parents wouldn't find out. And a lot of these kind of tinkering or things that I built more for fun became kind of my semblance. So I guess a lot of what I do, even in business, building business is that zero one thing, kind of finding a problem set and kind of building the product or figuring out what is the product that could be a potential solution for it. So very much less of the money making side, but more of the how do I build something to solve this? Yeah, you're always trying to","The discussion revolves around the speaker's earliest childhood memories of money and how they shaped his financial mindset. He grew up in a frugal immigrant family that practiced price-matching and always looked for the cheapest deals. Though the speaker no longer price matches, he still maintains a frugal mindset and always thinks about ways to save money. As a child, he was more interested in building and tinkering with things than in making money. However, he learned to code on his own and built his own websites, not realizing that it could be applied to a career or making money. It wasn't until his junior year in college when he learned about entrepreneurship and startups from mentors and people he looked up to that he became interested in building a company of his own."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ywsan9rXnaU_sep_504_836,Ywsan9rXnaU_sep_504_836,"Were you a professional gamer for a while? Very briefly. My first year of college and then I realized my GPA really took a hit. I had to stop that. But yeah, it was something that I played a lot of video games growing up. I very much wanted to get a sponsor, kind of see what that's like. And my first taste of freedom going to college, I was like, oh, I could do this. My parents started watching over my shoulders. I tried it out. It was, I guess, I've come to appreciate a lot more of just professional. I had that understanding when it came to sports, but video games was something that I did for fun. But I have come to appreciation after that experience of just the hard work, all those kind of professional players, whether it's Fortnite, or kind of Dota, or Starcraft put in. Because once it became kind of a real job or something professional, the practices were mandatory. Things became a lot less fun, if you will, and it became mandatory, right? So I came to appreciate that a lot more, that aspect. But you could make money doing that while you were in school? At that time, the video gaming space was not as robust as it is today. So it was less about making money, but it's more like, oh, you could get kind of a free computer or a free laptop, that kind of stuff. But yes, some sort like that. Well, that's meaningful for a student, for sure. That's right. It's funny. Yeah, it reminds me a little bit about, I read Andrei Agassi's book, and he was very open about he hated tennis, even though he was one of the greatest. And then years later, when he married Steffi Graf, and he told her, like he confessed to her, I hate tennis. And her answer was, don't we all? I remember reading that book, Andrei Agassi. I played tennis kind of in high school, and Andrei Agassi was definitely one of my idols or someone I looked up to. So when I read that book, a lot of things was very interesting, a lot of strong takeaways there. So ClearCo is an amazing growth story. Tell us about how a small group of founders came together, even living in the same house. Yeah, it was, I have to give credit to my other two co-founders, Andrew and Michelle, they kind of pulled the kind of the gang together. But we were all kind of repeat founders. And so some were successful than others, and very different set of experiences. Some of us had bootstrapped companies, others had kind of raised the traditional kind of venture capital routes. And when we started talking about building companies, a couple of things really came to light. One was the fact that nobody really starts a business to fundraise. They usually start a business so you could serve your customers or build a product or do something that you want to do. And then you realize that six months a year, you're on the road pitching investors, right? And it's not something people want to do. And secondly, is that it's, it's frankly pretty tough, right? You'd have to know the right people, have the right connections. And it's a common thing in the VC space that you need to know a intro to an investor. Code emailing is not the right answer, but it doesn't really work. So that's something that we kind of all had a passion for, of how can we better help fund the next generation of founders? How can we help enable founders and democratize capital if you will? And yes, we started the company in San Francisco, down in the States, but we're all Canadians. So we moved back up to Canada eventually, but now it's all remote since 2020. What is the cliff notes of each founder's experience since you mentioned different paths? And I'm curious about different skill sets too. Yeah. So I think the, the Clearco or what we built had an interesting, it required an interesting overlap of different skill sets. So one of my co-founders is very strong in kind of the fundraising, the traditional venture fundraising side. Is that Andrew? That's Andrew. Michelle, on the other hand, have bootstrapped as scaled multiple businesses and exited businesses on that side. So I've very much had that perspective and also kind of seen a lot of companies on Dragons then she's seen a lot of these businesses that were great fundamental businesses, but just not a great fit for the traditional venture model. It doesn't have that know a thousand X that Airbnb or, or Coinbase could be. And my other two co-founders, we had one that was very strong on the kind of data statistics, econometrics and kind of capital market side. And then another person who was very strong on the product side. And I kind of sat somewhere in between finance, more traditional kind of credit rating or finance space and data. So it was interesting because it almost required a founding team. I think that's needed overlapping skillset between finance, product kind of tech and data to build a product of what we did. Yeah. I saw that Michelle, you mentioned Dragons Den and for us here in the U S who may not be familiar that I've seen it referred to as Canada's shark tank. And I think that she sold her, she sold a company to Groupon. That's right.","The conversation starts with the interviewee briefly mentioning that they used to be a professional gamer in their first year of college, but had to stop due to their GPA taking a hit. They discuss the hard work and dedication required of professional gamers and how the industry has changed over time. The conversation then shifts to ClearCo, a company with a unique approach to funding startups. The interviewee explains how the founding team had different skill sets, with some experienced in traditional venture fundraising and others in bootstrapping and scaling businesses. One of the co-founders had even sold a company to Groupon and had appeared on Canada's version of Shark Tank, Dragons Den."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ywsan9rXnaU_sep_836_957,Ywsan9rXnaU_sep_836_957,"Yeah, so that's pretty cool. Today ClearCo has invested, I saw on the website, $2.5 billion funding over 6,500 businesses in seven countries. It's a really exciting story. How much time took place since the end of 2015 until that became the mission? Because I know that there have been different iterations and the business changed. Yeah, most definitely. And I think for anyone who's kind of thinking about entrepreneurship or thinking about a startup, it's definitely not a straight line. It had a lot of kind of windy paths. And for us, we always knew that we wanted to help kind of enable or democratize capital, kind of somewhere in that vein. It's like help founders, how can we enable the next generation of founders? But what product exactly are we building and exactly who are these founders? Because founders is a very broad term, right? It ranges anywhere from someone in the creator space who's on YouTube or making content all the way to someone who is kind of deep technology, kind of trying to make it modern, right? Or trying to make the next kind of cure for cancer. And we took a lot of iterations at that. So it wasn't until probably 22 to 23 years in where we kind of figured out that we cracked it that the e-commerce space had a great fit for what we're building, specifically around the type of founders that need capital to scale their business. Once they kind of figured out the fundamental economics of the company and they realized that they just need to pour essentially gasoline on the fire. And traditionally, that's still done with venture capital, where 40% of VC dollars goes into marketing. So they just go straight to Google and Facebook, right? We were, in our eyes, that's much better spent in a non diluted, in a non diluted, in a non diluted, in a non diluted, in a non diluted, in a non diluted.","The discussion touches on ClearCo, a company that has invested $2.5 billion in over 6,500 businesses in seven countries. The company's mission was to democratize capital and help founders scale their businesses. However, it took many iterations to figure out which product and which type of founders they wanted to help. Eventually, they realized that the e-commerce space was a good fit for their mission. Instead of using traditional venture capital, ClearCo wanted to pour money into non-dilutive marketing to help businesses grow."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ywsan9rXnaU_sep_958_1261,Ywsan9rXnaU_sep_958_1261,"You guys started in Silicon Valley, like one of the, it's like the heart of VC land. Like so many startups get funded in Silicon Valley. Were there sort of problems that you, were there shortcomings that you saw that you identified that you had a solution for? What problem were you trying to solve? Yeah, the main problem were initially, I guess, when we started the company, it was the broader kind of mission or idea that there were a lot of great founders out there that just weren't in Silicon Valley, right? Or weren't connected to the right circle. So like in Canada, we kind of need to be in whether it's Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, there's a few big cities, right? Or Ottawa is starting to become more of a bigger city, right? Because there's a few of these larger cities, whether it's the US, New York, right, Silicon Valley. And for the founders who are just not plugged into these venture or investor ecosystems, it becomes a much tougher game, if you will, to access capital. So that's kind of one lens that we really thought about from a mission perspective. And then number two, it was what we realized kind of that statistic around the fact that there's such a high percentage of every dollar that people raise and give up their equity for. So you give up 20, 30% of your company, you raise a chunk of money, and then you kind of turn around and spend most of that money, 40% of it, to Google and Facebook because you need to scale and grow your business for good reasons. And we just thought that was a very inefficient way of using capital. There's got to be a better way, if you will. Let's talk about that because it really raises the idea of use of capital. Like what are you using the money for? And then as a founder of the business, how are you accessing that money? Are you doing it through equity? Are you doing it through debt? And what are the expectations as far as what are you giving up for that money and how to apply it? So what's kind of the thinking as far as as a business owner, should I sell equity? Where should I be allocating those dollars versus what you guys identified? A lot of e-commerce businesses were really needing money for marketing and I think inventory. And maybe they shouldn't be giving up 30% of their company for that type of money. Yeah. We think of capital allocation or the best use of capital, like you said, as a cash flow matching exercise. So if you think about kind of the corporate finance function or the finance function of any company, finance is effectively trying to figure out the right instrument to match cash inflows and cash outflows. You have, let's say, so if you're doing a heavy R&D project, you have cash outflow. You're paying salaries, you're doing R&D investment for probably a number of years until you get a payout 10 years later. That is probably something where equity capital makes a lot of sense. It's risk capital. It's capital where you're investing in R&D. And who knows 10 years later if you're going to get something or not. Right. And that's where equity capital makes a lot of sense. When you're looking at, for example, Facebook marketing or if you're looking at inventory, like you mentioned, it kind of begs the question of is that still the best way to fund that that use of that need of capital? And for example, for most marketing exercises, it's usually kind of a 30 to 90 day turnaround. Like you put your money into Facebook 30 days later or even sooner than that. Sometimes you'll get the customers coming in from Facebook and they'll pay or they'll buy whatever e-commerce product you're selling. And in those cases, well, depending on how short it is, sometimes you can use a credit card. Right. You just don't even you don't even need clear code. You don't even need alternative financing. And then you have kind of the stuff in the middle. Right. For example, you buy inventory and that inventory is going to sit in your warehouse for six months. It's probably too long for a credit card. Right. That's that's very high interest rate you'd be paying. But it's also probably too short for kind of a true equity capital. So I think. The current kind of ecosystem when it comes to kind of money like the good thing about capital is that's fungible at the end of the day. But I believe that we're going to see a lot more different types of alternative kind of instruments to fund different uses of proceeds. And we're starting to see a bit of that. We have a few companies that's doing kind of inventory capital funding specifically. We do inventory marketing. There's ones that's technically even shorter terms, kind of like the brecks, the credit cards of the world. And we're seeing a whole spectrum. It's very, very encouraging, very encouraging, very encouraging, very encouraging, very encouraging, very encouraging.","The discussion centers around the inefficiency in the traditional method of accessing capital for startups, particularly for those who are not plugged into the venture or investor ecosystems in big cities like Silicon Valley. The founders of the startup discussed the high percentage of equity that startups often have to give up in exchange for funding, and the inefficient use of that funding when a significant portion is spent on marketing and inventory. They suggest that capital allocation should be a cash flow matching exercise, with different types of alternative instruments for funding different uses of proceeds. The current ecosystem is seen as encouraging, with a range of options emerging such as inventory capital funding and short-term financing."

And I'm also curious like how much pushback did you guys get on this idea of giving money to small businesses? one Many of them have little history and two you do not have an ability to collect on their personal or business assets That's right. It was it was very tough One of the things that's very encouraging for us nowadays is that we're starting to see a lot more Clear code for a different industry or clear code for a different geography That's very encouraging to us because it means that the broader community is starting to accept it Right, like the fact that we funded two point five billion dollars is a large number But it's still very tiny in the grand scheme of kind of finance or inventory Like any kind of any way you slice and dice finance 2.5 is like a tiny sliver In the grand scheme of things so in order to actually start to really move the industry We'd like that the fact that other players are starting to see it what's encouraging to see that and for us the the question around kind of The question really became What how what gives us enough confidence that this business is? We're going to get our money back right like you said we can't It's not personally guaranteed it's not secure against their assets we can't go collect on it it's purely based on the revenue the future revenue of these businesses and The main reason we kind of arrived at this conclusion is Because what we realize is that there's a gap in the market where a lot more business nowadays are being The future of business that we see are becoming more digital businesses The business that doesn't have an oven or a factory that you can kind of collateralize against and by definition They these digital businesses are asset light They don't have these things you collateralize against yet What we see kind of as a as a as a pro as a feature of that business the fact that their asset light is is actually being penalized in the traditional system of saying well you don't have assets to collateralize against and That's kind of what we realized that way Revenue these business while they don't have something tangible today What they do is actually they do have something very tangible in terms of their customer base and the product that are selling and Based on the data we can see That doesn't really show up on their financial statements as much you could kind of start to Have pretty strong confidence of whether you'll see those revenues repeat themselves next month for months after and so on and the way We get these data points is we connect to their first party data sources we connect to the Shopify's we connect to the stripes connect to the Google's we connect to the Amazon's and these are Raw data that we get data feeds we get first party data that can't be altered that can't be Manipulated in any way and they are raw data of this customer buys this thing at this time, right and it's very powerful data Since you get so much of it and you start to get a very full understanding of how essentially get a piece together What this business is really like kind of from our ground up so the benefit to The founder is that they're not taking on debt for their business if they don't pay you back They're not going to go bankrupt You guys are taking that financial risk That's right. We're taking on a different type of risk very very It's It's not that it's not quite equity either. It's revenue-based financing. So it is still a liability I guess right it is still something they have to pay what they don't have to pay back But a portion of their future revenues will be will need to pay it back But the advantage for the founder, for example is if their business Goes not goes under hopefully but you know, for example takes a dip could be due to seasonality could be due to 2020 We had this actually happened to us right in started 2020 Now e-commerce is doing really well, but started 2020. It wasn't right. It was the pandemic hit kovat 19 and all of our customers were Go up their revenues tanked for a lack of better words and in the traditional system We would have you know, if this was traditional debt We would have the banks would have asked to well, we still need to pay our money back right loans alone In our case because it's a revenue share and a revenue-based financing the revenue dips we just collect less money right and in that kind of sense our incentives are very much aligned with the company of that, you know When things are doing well, we're happy. They're happy what things are doing poorly. These are doing poorly. These are doing poorly These are doing poorly. These are doing poorly","The discussion is about a new financing structure for small businesses that is based on revenue-based financing. The founders realized that many digital businesses don't have tangible assets to collateralize against, and traditional financing systems penalize these businesses for being asset-light. To solve this problem, they offer revenue-based financing, where the businesses don't take on debt, but instead, a portion of their future revenues will pay back the financing. This structure reduces the risk for the founders, as they won't go bankrupt if their business takes a dip, and it aligns the incentives between the company and the financing company. The founders faced pushback on the idea initially, but they're encouraged by the broader community's acceptance of the concept."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ywsan9rXnaU_sep_1552_1756,Ywsan9rXnaU_sep_1552_1756,"Yeah, certainly your incentives are aligned and it's in your best interest to be helping those business owners through advice, through networking, because that comes back to you through the revenue share. This is very, it's a very data-driven approach. I don't know if that's, I don't know if you would call that AI or how, like what the analysis process or evaluation process, what you call that. My guess is that that also gets iterated many times. Like, how did the initial cohorts go and were there times when you lost money and then you need to course correct to evolve the process? Yeah, I think this is a quote set by Max Lepchin of a firm, the PayPal, one of the PayPal folks. And he said that in the credit business or in the business, kind of like a firm, you have to almost put capital at risk to learn your lessons. And that was the same for us. A lot of the early lessons were hard-earned lessons. We did lose money. Not every cohort went well. And but I think the important part is that as we're getting a lot, there's two things that is very helpful as we move forward. One is even at the early days, it was encouraging for us because we were able to improve. Even though we lost money for some of our earlier cohorts, we kind of identify, oh, it's because we forgot about this element or we didn't think about this feature. And then we add that in, you see the model improves a little bit. You might still be losing a little bit of money, but you get those incremental improvements really gave us confidence that this is a path that we can eventually get to a state where we believe that the I guess the probability of default or the risk we're taking on is actually less than traditional lows. And now we're actually got we've gotten to that state where our risk is actually lower than kind of industry standards. And the it's very much based on kind of a large lot of data and AI models that we use to kind of predict what the future revenues of this business will do and try to predict, try to better understand how will this business fare in the landscape on its peers and other businesses. And like kind of like you said, Andy, I mentioned earlier, because it's in our incentive to help these businesses, we also kind of invest or put a lot of effort into building products that can actually help our customers make more money. Right. We do it because it helps us too. So the incentives are very much aligned there. It is a it's a fascinating story. What are some of those industry metrics? Like what's expected for profit versus loss in controlling that risk? What is industry average? Yeah, it kind of changes for depending on kind of what subsegment you're looking at. So I think Lending Club has their data published online. I think they're there around kind of 7 percent. If you like, I can have more asset backed loans. I personally guarantee you get lower to kind of a 2 percent ratio or 3 percent. And yeah, that's kind of what the industry is currently looking at.","The discussion is about a data-driven approach to providing credit to small businesses. The speaker explains that the company's incentives are aligned with those of the business owners, as their revenue share depends on the success of the business. The approach is based on using AI models to predict the future revenues of the business and understand how it will fare against its peers. The speaker acknowledges that there were hard-earned lessons in the early days of the business, including losses and course corrections. However, with incremental improvements, the company has gained confidence that their risk is lower than industry standards. The industry averages for profit versus loss control risk vary depending on the subsegment, but typically range from 2% to 7%."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ywsan9rXnaU_sep_1757_1972,Ywsan9rXnaU_sep_1757_1972,"Let's talk a little bit about the expected trajectory of some of these e-commerce businesses, because my understanding is that there is a difference between what you're doing and traditional VC also. Let me ask you this, what kind of rate of return are you looking for? Because I think it's different than traditional VC, where the hope might be like a 10X or 100X the investment. Yeah, I think Michelle had a great example, one of my co-founders, the Canadian version of Shark Tank, where she was looking at a business that sold iPhone cases, these nice wooden cases that were selling very well. But it's probably not a business that's going to become the next Airbnb, right? Like they were selling hundreds of thousands of dollars, they're probably going to sell millions of dollars, right? But it's probably not going to become billions of dollars of iPhone cases. So you don't get that kind of 1000X return that VCs almost need for their investment to return the fund, if you will. While for us, because we're looking at much shorter kind of investment cycles, we're not looking for anything like that. We're just looking for essentially a flat fee. So that's again, kind of why the incentives are aligned, because the way we charge or we make our money is, let's say we give a company about $100,000, right? We charge 6%. So what that means is we make $6,000, right? Now, the question is just more so do we make that $6,000 in six months or do we make that $6,000 in eight months? And we hope we make it in six months, because that just means that, well, with the kind of machine we built, it just means we get to redeploy that capital somewhere else. And it's a higher APR as a result. But if the company isn't doing as well as we thought it would, well, it might take eight months, it might take 12 months, right? And that's kind of the difference. I understand that you do some angel investing yourself. How similar are, like how similar do you approach investing your own money versus what you're doing at Clearco? Quite differently. And I think having been building Clearco for the last six years, having gone through that has really changed my perspective in terms of kind of what kind of business I want to put money behind from an angel investment perspective. I still believe, and we have a lot of, you know, with Clearco, Clearco has a lot of tight partnerships with whether it's venture capital companies or kind of VCs out there. And it's because there is a need for true risk capital, right? Businesses who are developing a new product, something that doesn't exist before. Like, for example, if someone started Airbnb again, right, or Coinbase, they would not be a good candidate for Clearco. There's not enough revenue in the early days. It requires so much momentum that you have to build before you kind of get that significant amount of capital. And it just wouldn't fit our current models that we have. But if you're selling, for example, weighted blankets or if you're selling apparel, that could be a very good fit. And what it made me kind of more conscious of as an angel investor is I'm trying to spend both my capital as well as my time on companies where I believe that I could add some to be a value to. So usually these end up being somewhere in the fintech space, somewhere in the space of potentially AI or capital lending, lending related.","Clearco, a company that provides alternative funding options for e-commerce businesses, is not looking for the kind of return that traditional VCs seek, which is typically a 10X or 100X return on investment. Instead, Clearco charges a flat fee of 6% for its investments, and its goal is to make that money back in a shorter investment cycle. The company is interested in businesses that are generating revenue, but may not have the potential to become billion-dollar enterprises. Clearco's CEO believes that there is still a need for true risk capital for businesses that are developing new products or services. As an angel investor, he looks for companies in the fintech, AI, or capital lending space where he believes he can add value."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ywsan9rXnaU_sep_1973_2227,Ywsan9rXnaU_sep_1973_2227,"At ClearCo, it sounds like a relatively safe type of investment. My guess is that you're looking for a... Like the concept has already been proven out. There are sales, there are revenues. Hopefully it's profitable and the company just needs like an infusion of money to scale. And what kind of metrics do you look for in your evaluation? Because maybe you can talk a little bit about the 20-minute term sheet because it's a very unique approach. That's right. When it comes to ClearCo, the difference between a traditional angel investment is that a lot of times when I think about the angel investments I'm making, I'm betting on the founders or the teams or the kind of the new product or innovation that they're thinking about for their space that I'm not expecting a return for multiple years. And for ClearCo, it's very much the reverse of that, where it's looking at not really the teams, it's not looking at how fancy the pitch deck is and who they know. It's really about the data. It's really about for every dollar that they make or for every dollar that they spend, how much can they make? So it's very much about the fundamental unit economics or the economics of the business. A dollar comes in, how many dollars comes out? And we piece that together with all the data integrations we have. And as a result, we're able to fund these businesses. And a byproduct that we've seen over the years, that's been something that we lean more into, is the diversity of founders as a result that we end up funding. Because we don't look at the pitch deck or take intros in any way, we fund 8x more women than the traditional venture capital space. And 30% of our portfolio are BIPOC founders. So a lot of, I think, as a byproduct, the diversity of founders in our portfolio has been something that we... Well, in hindsight, it's been more obvious, but it's been something very encouraging for us. That's part of the big opportunity, right? Because at the outset of our talk, and you're talking about as a kid trying to arbitrage, like you're really trying to arbitrage geographically, like find these opportunities. There are business owners who they don't have access to capital in New York City or in Silicon Valley. That's right. But they're there and there's a great business opportunity to be had. Yeah, and I still believe that the best founders are those that are closest to whatever problem they're solving, something that's close to their heart. And especially for a lot of these e-commerce products, whether it's a certain kind of line of clothing or it's kind of sometimes a specific gadget that is targeted towards a certain demographic, oftentimes we find that the best founders for those are the ones that might live in the region or if you're thinking about like a, because like the one I saw recently is like a, it's like a kind of like a nightlight, but it's a heater. So you plug it into the wall and it heats up the room. And it's something that like, I don't really have that problem, but people who are kind of living maybe perhaps further north, they have that problem. Those are the right founders to tackle that. So I believe a lot of founder market fit. And most of those founders don't live in Silicon Valley, right? Or don't live in those large metropolitan cities. And as a result, they're naturally not connected to the right investor basis. But yet they built product that their community needs or a community or a demographic really cares about. And it's almost a shame that they don't get funded. So that's exactly as you said, I think that arbitrage is essentially the demographic and the geographic of different types of founders all over the world.","ClearCo is a safe investment option with proven sales and revenue, and the company is looking for an infusion of money to scale. The evaluation process focuses on unit economics, i.e., how much money can be made for every dollar spent. The company funds more women and BIPOC founders than traditional venture capitalists because they do not look at pitch decks or take intros. The best founders are often those closest to the problem they are solving, and most of them do not live in large metropolitan cities, making it a missed opportunity for investors. The opportunity lies in finding and funding diverse founders from different geographic and demographic backgrounds."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ywsan9rXnaU_sep_2228_2430,Ywsan9rXnaU_sep_2228_2430,"Yeah, interestingly, I think when it comes to e-commerce, especially once you have a local market, you also have a greater market than beyond your locality too. You can grow much bigger just because of the nature of e-commerce. Yeah. And I think that's one of the advantages of what e-commerce, but also kind of a lot of the new tools that Clearco is working on, really centered around how can we help founders sell their products across different geographies. Because like you said, by definition, e-commerce is almost borderless. You don't have to be in a certain location. Yet, when you think about the financial structures, if you want to actually sell in Belgium or the UK, yes, technically you sell there, but how do you deal with the shipping? How do you deal with the financial? How do you get a UK bank account? A lot of these things are actually currently barriers for founders. Those are things that Clearco is now working on to try to solve. What are some of those products and evolution of things that you can offer your funded businesses? Yeah, I think right now it goes back to the roots, goes back to kind of that previous Congress or we previously discussed around because our incentives are so well aligned with the founders, we just want them to grow. Because if their business grows, it's net good for us almost fairly directly. So our incentives are very much aligned in that regard. Because it is, a lot of our products that are being developed now is around payments and it's around giving people access to not only capital, but access to other parts that they don't traditionally have access to. So that might be the access to the right vendors, the right know-how, the right partners to help them continue to scale their business. And when we're thinking about even infrastructure builds, it's very much tied into, for example, being able to open a UK bank account, getting access to another geography that you traditionally would not be able to because you don't have the right UK corporations or permits to do so. With the businesses that you fund and work with, do you find that it's a one-time funding or do they come back for more? Yeah, it's mostly always more. So these are relationships we're looking to build. And because the capital we are giving people are generally speaking for marketing or inventory, that's one cycle at a time. If it works well and their business keeps growing, it usually repeats. And people come back for the next inventory purchase as they continue to grow and scale. I think that's kind of a lot of what we're looking forward to is to build those relationships with the founders as they kind of grow their business and help those founders all the way from the start of their business all the way to where they exit the business. So we also are working on things that are helping companies, for example, sell their business or figure out they've reached a point where as the founder, whatever their end goal is, we help them in that, whether it's wealth management or whether it's exiting the business.","The discussion is centered around the advantages of e-commerce in terms of reaching a wider market beyond one's locality, and the financial barriers that can hinder this growth. Clearco is working on developing products that help founders overcome these barriers, such as access to capital and other resources, as well as help with payments and infrastructure building to expand into different geographies. Clearco aims to build long-term relationships with the businesses they fund and work with, with the potential for repeat funding cycles as businesses continue to grow and scale. They also offer support to help founders manage their wealth and exit their businesses when the time comes."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ywsan9rXnaU_sep_2431_2827,Ywsan9rXnaU_sep_2431_2827,"how you've been able to navigate leading this company as it's scaled from a handful of founders to, I think you're over a thousand employees today. Yeah, I'm getting close to there. I don't think we're around six, seven hundred now, but we're getting close to that number. And the I think the answer is that it changes a lot, right? And I think I'm still learning. I'm still quite young and learning as kind of a leader myself. The parts that we had to change over the years. So when we started the company, we were kind of the five of us, a few more kind of living in a house, kind of living and breathing the product, if you will. And then as the company grew, we got an office and we kind of expanded. And today we've gone full remote and we had to make that hard change where we used to be very much an in-house or in-person culture to a well, a fully remote culture where we have different executives kind of all over the place now. And I think through that entire journey, it's taking it's I guess a lot of self-development, taking a lot of lessons, both in terms of feedback from your coaches, from how you should be doing things differently, but really being open to kind of changing the changing the rituals and changing the the processes that are open in the company. You want to keep while you want to keep the culture, if you will, or the kind of the values or principle you stand for fairly consistent or close to your heart. The the rituals or the the secret, the cadence of meetings, let's say that you would have with a 10 percent team is very, very different from 100 percent. And it's very, very different from what it is today. And that's something we had to consistently adapt. And one of the challenges actually, I think that I had a lot of as a kind of a not a first time founder, but still kind of a founder going through this kind of for the first time, this kind of hypergrowth is adapting. And just as I'm getting used to the routines that we built for 50 people, we're like, oh, those routines or those processes no longer work. And that constant, I guess, I guess the only constant is change. All right. So really much being OK with that is something that I struggle through and kind of adapt it as I as I grew. I can't even imagine dealing with that rate of change. And I understand that you've had seven titles in five years, had a product, had a marketing, had a growth of finance, of strategy, of business operations and of new ventures. Have you gotten really good at selecting and training someone to replace your role so that you can step into a new one? Yeah, pretty much. And I guess more recently, kind of like I've essentially hired myself out of a job and I'm transitioning to kind of starting something new. But my job in the company has always been a lot of that zero to one, whether it's a new product or a new team. It was very much of I was essentially the first person to start the product team, right, or start the growth team, or start the biz ops team and build up to a stage, find someone that could help replace me and move on to the next. And I've gotten, I guess, I guess this is applicable to anything that is if you kind of do it enough times or kind of you kind of adapt to that, how that process works. And for me, there was a lot of the how do you get something from nothing, from scratch, from zero to a place where you then need to hand over kind of feels a bit of like handing over your baby, handing over something that you know full well is in better hands with someone else's hand than it is in your own because that person that you've brought on is probably smarter, probably better at that particular function than you are and letting go. And I think that's something that I had to really kind of figure out how to do. I think it's much easier said than done. The letting go part especially. Any tips on actually really doing the handoff? I think I've tried different methods. And I think, again, a lot of these goes back to personal preference and kind of what's whoever's listening kind of applies for them. And I would encourage kind of people to try out different things. I think one of the things that we got really good at as a company as well as for myself is just iterating and being okay with kind of the all these things that we try out or we do, whether it's a new algorithm or whether it's the way we kind of deploy capital or allocate resources is just an experiment. Try it out, see if it works. It might work for someone else, but it might not work for you and keep experimenting. And for me, the part that helped letting go the most was actually making a very, doing kind of a bit of a, I guess like a something a bit more formal and almost like cold turkey, letting it go if you will. So having someone, having them shadow you for a little bit of time so they kind of understand what you like to do at the very least. Or at least understand a lot of the context. Because I think a lot of the reasons why someone, why you would make a decision different than someone else is not because your better decision-maker or they're not as good, but actually comes down to context. If you believe that that person you hired is smart and capable on their own, and oftentimes the reason why you would have made a different judgment call than they would have is just because you had prior history. Well, I have all the history, right? The multiple years of history, as well as they have their own different set of history, right? Of the previous companies they've worked at or different teams they're on. And that influences a lot of the judgment calls you make. And what I've come to appreciate a lot more is kind of that idea of leading by context and a lot more of trying to tell people not what you would do, but tell people the prior history or context that I'm, that kind of comprises of the decision that I want to make. And yeah, and then I guess shadow for some time, do an official handoff and try to just observe and try your hardest not to try to meddle afterwards. At some point you have to rip the band-aid off. You have to rip the band-aid off.","The discussion covers the challenges of leading a company as it scales from a small group to a large team. The speaker explains that the process involves a lot of self-development, adapting rituals, and changing processes to keep the values of the company consistent while scaling up. The speaker discusses their experience of constantly adapting to change as they grew, and how they had to adapt to the routines that worked for a smaller team but no longer worked for a larger one. They also discuss their experience of hiring and training others to replace their role and how they have gotten better at it over time. The speaker advises that the key to the handoff is to make a formal and clear transition and to ensure that the person who replaces you understands the context and knows what you like to do. Finally, the speaker recommends that people try different methods of adapting to change and finding what works for them."

We're about to talk with the fund manager who specializes in tactical risk on risk off investing strategies. Episode 204 features Michael Gayette, award-winning author, portfolio manager at Torozo Investment. Michael Gayette, CEO of Torozo Investment In our business, there are only cycles. There are no gurus in this business, there are only cycles. Some people have seen me, saw me as a guru last year with how I navigated the COVID crash. Being in treasuries prior to it happening, being in equities, you know, pretty much a week after the low, it had nothing to do with me. I was giving voice to math, but the cycle allowed me to give that voice to math and for that voice to be accurate. And I think that's sort of a very underappreciated aspect when it comes to this business that people don't realize. The cycle is everything. I hope this episode makes you a better investor because our guests today invest with passion, focus, and discipline. Conventional wisdom says to buy and hold over the long term, but what if you're retired or just cannot afford to lose a lot? Then it may make sense to look at strategies that go up less in good times while protecting your money in difficult times. Michael has developed three alternative strategies based on his award-winning papers that identify different leading signals that dictate when to be invested, risk on, or defensive, risk off. The names of his strategies are the ATAC Rotation Fund, that's a mutual fund that looks at short-term behavior of utilities and treasuries to determine when to be risk on in large caps, small caps, and emerging markets, or risk off in treasuries. The ATAC US Rotation ETF, symbol RORO, adjusts its holdings based on the short-term behavior of lumber relative to gold. And the ATAC Credit Rotation ETF, symbol JOJO, uses the short-term behavior of utilities relative to the broader stock market to rotate between high-yield bond ETFs and long-duration treasuries. In this episode, you'll learn how Michael developed his process-driven investment approach, why rejection hurts, and the benefits of allocating to different asset classes like bonds, stocks, and even cryptocurrencies. Now let's get inspired with Michael Gayed. Michael, welcome to Inspired Money. I'm so excited to have you on the show. Andrew, I've known you for a long time, but I feel like we need to know each other more. So this would be a good opportunity to do that. Let's jump right in. What's your earliest childhood memory of money? That's an interesting question. So I had this scheme when I was younger. I say scheme purposely, where my parents used to always have this place that they would put coins in, in their bedroom, right? And I always knew where that was. So I would every now and then just take a couple pennies here and there, a couple quarters, a couple nickels, and then I would give it to my parents saying, oh, look, I found all these coins at the playground. You think you can give me some cash for this? And then they'd give me cash for the coins that were there to begin with, and they will put it back in the same spot, right? And then what did I do? I went back to the same spot in the bedroom, took the same coins I got the dollars from, okay, and then repeated the scheme over and over again. Don't let that change your view of me as a money manager with the funds that I run in Roro and Jojo. But I think my first experience with money was the, I guess, maybe the ability to compound, I guess, at a young age with coins from my parents. But no, but aside from that, I mean, I've had kind of a long history in the investment business more so because of the osmosis from the experience of my parents. So my father worked for Bob Farrell in the late 1980s, who was this well-known technician at Merrill Lynch, started up his own investment firm in the 90s. And I used to always say I used to go to bed or go to dinner every single night talking to my father, my mother, and Mr. Market, because he would constantly talk about markets and investing with my mother. And all I wanted to do was play Game Boy, right? And I couldn't do that as easily when he was talking about all these different stocks. So I kind of had exposure at a young age to a lot of these kind of basic concepts. We were just talking before the show about our mutual times at the New York Stock Exchange, worked there for a summer internship myself. I know you did as well, or at least kind of experienced some of it. So always been around the field of money, always been around the field of investing, which I guess in many ways is a curse because you start realizing how little everybody else knows when you see the mistakes everyone does repeatedly time after time.","The discussion features Michael Gayette, CEO of Torozo Investment, a fund manager who specializes in tactical risk on risk off investing strategies.

My dad was at the Bank of New York, and I know that Bob Farrell was among those who came through the bank and gave presentations. So definitely some common experiences there. Today, you're a portfolio manager at Torozo Asset Management. You've been publishing the Lead Lag Report for a while. I have to say that you are among the hardest working people in this business. Take us... How is it that you got started? You mentioned that your dad and you talked about the market as like the third person at the dinner table. And I had those discussions about return on equity and why that matters at the dinner table at our house. But how is it that you decided to get started, you know, actually working in this business? And I think, by the way, that you and I were probably the most popular kids in school because we would talk about return on equity. That's always... Yes, that's always... Makes you popular. Made us popular among the women back then. So the... A couple of things. Okay. So first of all, I do believe, I mean, it's kind of cliche to say that, you know, if you love what you do, you don't work it in your life. But I think there's an element of truth to that. And, you know, as much as I put a lot of research and content through Lee Lagerpord and through the Twitter account and through communications with advisors, you know, smart guys like you, right? I mean, all I try and do is give voice to math and say it in 500 different ways. I think the trick in a lot of the stuff about investing is not just about the investment process, but how do you communicate. And that's just something that comes with time and practice, right? So I tried to write a book on sort of a teenager's guide to the stock market, which was actually one of the submissions I gave to NYU for getting into NYU student school business because I was just excited about the field. I liked the time at the New York Stock Exchange. I very much looked up to my father and the work that he had done, as I'm sure you, you know, with your father as well. And, you know, it was not one of those situations where I was pushed into the field. It's just something that I liked. I enjoyed it. I found it intellectually stimulating more than just greed is good, that there's actually much more to it than that. And, you know, joined the family business and institutional investment management firm. My father also had hedge funds, had some experience doing that. I actually ran a very small hedge fund in 2007, not exactly the best of timing, just before Lehman Brothers in the wait. But, you know, kind of baptism by fire, right? It's one of those things where I put myself in a situation and kind of figure it out in a minute. And on the work ethic thing, I appreciate that. Look, everybody works hard in their field, in their industry. It's just a function of how much you want to show that through your communications, your research, all your thought leadership. And, you know, the reality is it's very hard to work extremely hard for prolonged periods of time until you unless you have the right support. And people that understand and are patient with that and that will help you and support you, as you know yourself and family-owned business. You know, I think that's a very underappreciated aspect to working extremely hard.","The discussion is about the guest's career in finance, specifically as a portfolio manager at Torozo Asset Management and his publication of the Lead Lag Report. He talks about his interest in the field starting from a young age and how he found it intellectually stimulating beyond just greed. He also mentions how important communication is in the investment process and how he tries to give voice to math in multiple ways. Additionally, he talks about the challenges of working extremely hard for prolonged periods of time and the importance of having a supportive network."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7THgm-phQc_sep_580_897,T7THgm-phQc_sep_580_897,"Yeah. Did you work with your dad directly for a time? So, yeah. So he had his own firm, Woodford Guyant Management, and he started in 1991 with no clients. He and his partner, when they got to about a billion dollars, went through arbitration. And then he started up another investment firm in 1999. Now, at the time he was running large cap growth institutional portfolios. He was one of the few who refused to buy into the tech bubble. So even prior to the relaunch of his new firm, he was suffering the wrath of people saying, why aren't you participating in this extreme upside? And you've been through them and seen a lot of these stories back then too. You were crucified if you didn't participate on the upside. So he started up his own second investment firm after that, as well as the hedge fund. I joined at NYU in 04, the family business. It was institutional, not retail, not traditional financial advisory, mainly defined benefit allocations from states. And he passed away in 08. I was not of age to take over the business. And it was one of those really kind of trying times in my life personally, professionally, because aside from him passing away, it's like, well, here comes the great financial crisis. Who the hell is this guy, Michael Guyant? Most people can't even pronounce my last name correctly. Right. And I must have sent my resume into a thousand plus jobs in 09. And there were stories back then of how some of these large firms would have this stack of resumes because of all the layoffs. Everybody's looking for a job post-Lehman. And they would take the first half off and throw it away of that stack of resumes. And the argument was, well, these firms didn't want to employ people who were unlucky. This is the kind of stupidity that was happening in 09 as far as trying to find a job. So I had to reinvent myself with zero name, zero recognition, nowhere to go. And this is horrible situation family-wise with my father passing. So hooked up with an investment firm that had known for a while and reinvented myself. It's funny because I'm sure, and I'm curious actually to hear your story on this as well. You know, you grow up, you have this vision of who you're going to be. You say to yourself, this is my North Star. I'm going to get to where I want to be. And you always think it's going to be a straight line. And it always ends up looking like this. It's always very windy. And it's never quite the way that you thought you'd be. And you never are at the place you thought you'd be at the age that you're at, but you know, you're still kind of getting roughly to the blurry end point. Right. I'm sure you've kind of gone through that yourself in different ways as well. Oh yeah. I mean, you see the, they have that meme that, you know, this is what you think success looks like, and this is what it really looks like. And real life, there are so many variables. You try to do everything that's within your control, but then all the external factors that are outside of your control, things like a financial crisis or an internet bubble, you're just constantly adapting. And sometimes the winds at your back and other times you're falling on your face and you're trying to figure out how quickly do I get up and which direction do it. You have to reorient yourself when you stand up. No, and it's kind of, that's why I told you the joke when somebody says, what's your five year plan? It's like, are you kidding me? You know, nobody can predict the future. Right. Because exactly your point, these variables come in that nobody sees coming that throw off your entire path. You're still walking forward, but you might be falling forward while you're walking. Right. And you're to your point, you're going to be in all these different directions. So yeah. And that's why, you know, it's true. It's, I forget if it was Bezos, but somebody is a quote, you know, I often quote things in writings, the quote, something like, you know, success is going from failure to failure without loss of optimism or loss of energy. Right. So in my case, I had to completely reinvent myself and I'm a stubborn guy. I didn't want to just sort of accept sort of a standard life in the industry. I wanted to build. I wanted to be that guy that people looked at in middle school and high school as the stock market guy. I wanted to be the guy that people wanted to look up to and as a thought leader. And to your point, in every endeavor, there's skill and there's luck. I always say that, you know, this kind of well-known equation, right? Success is a function of talent plus obsession plus error. Error is luck in that equation. It could be good luck, it could be bad luck, but success has talent, obsession, error. The harsh reality, I think, is that most people don't realize that error is pretty much the difference maker between success and failure. That luck is a big part of it. And I'll be the first one to say I've been very fortunate and very lucky in my life. I was able to come back out of, you know, horrendous pain from my father passing from the family business closing to try to get the right, you know, myself righted, right? Kind of get back on the right path and get back on the right path.","The discussion revolves around the personal and professional life of Michael Guyant, whose father ran a finance company that he later joined. After his father's death in 2008, Michael found it difficult to get a job in the industry during the financial crisis. He eventually reinvented himself, working with another investment firm and becoming a thought leader. The conversation touches on the unpredictable nature of success, the importance of luck in achieving it, and the need to adapt to changing circumstances."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7THgm-phQc_sep_925_1043,T7THgm-phQc_sep_925_1043,"moment? How do you decide reinventing yourself? What does that mean? It's one of those things where it's like, it's simple, you have to say to yourself, there's no choice. Right? It's either you, you, you basically give in and give up where you say, well, you know, it's kind of like when you're at your at your lowest moment, there's nowhere to go but up, right? So, for me, practically, what that meant was, you know, the markets were still volatile, end of 08 and into 09, obviously, and I had to find a way to make some money. I mean, you know, I had to make some income. So I obsessed over trading strategies. So I was one of Freestation's clients, right? And I learned how to program easy language, their programming language. And I started doing nothing but testing, I was obsessed. I was every single day every single night optimizing testing, trying different signals, trying different indicators, looking at quantitative books, reading white papers every other day on market anomalies, because I said to myself, you know what, if I don't get a job, I got to figure out a way to do this on my own. And it's funny, because a lot of that work in the back testing is what led me to funds that I run. Because from everything that I've seen from all the testing I would do, which was out of necessity, because I was in a very desperate situation, it became very clear to me that most things that people say most signals most indicators that people track are complete nonsense. I know because I've tested it. Most things don't have predictive power. But I wouldn't have known that with hindsight, unless I went through that pain, unless I was in a dire situation where I had to feel like my back's against the wall, I got to figure something out. So it turns out that that experience, I think looking back with hindsight is actually what kind of got me to this place. I couldn't have launched the mutual fund, the Roro ETF, the Jojo ETF, the risk on risk off, jump on, jump off on ETF, I could have done anything I've done unless I actually had that starting base of knowing what works, works, works, works, works, works, works, works, works, works, works, works, works, works, works, works,","The discussion is about reinventing oneself in finance during a difficult time. The speaker talks about their experience during the volatile markets in 2008-2009 when they had to find a way to make income. They became obsessed with testing trading strategies and programming language, which led them to discover that most signals and indicators are complete nonsense. Through this experience, they gained valuable knowledge that helped them launch successful mutual funds and ETFs. The key takeaway is that reinventing oneself in finance requires a willingness to adapt, learn, and test different strategies, even during challenging times."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7THgm-phQc_sep_1046_1346,T7THgm-phQc_sep_1046_1346,"But from 08 to 2012, you're testing all these different trading strategies. You're looking for predictive signals to give you an advantage. And you do end up launching the ATAC rotation fund in 2012. And it's been a long road. It has not been an overnight success. What was the premise at launch? So it's interesting because again, success equals talent plus obsession plus error. So let's go into the error part of this. So the premise of everything from my testing was very simple. And I use this line on Twitter on at Leadlac report that if you want to kill it in the stock market, you have to not get killed. So for me, the mindset has always been around risk management. Because in all the back tests I would do through trade station, any kind of trend following, anything that people refer to as a way of identifying an upside environment, it turns out it's much more about downside risk mitigation than upside capture. That was the real aha moment in a lot of the testing was that it really was about protecting on the downside. Now the mutual fund was an outgrowth of, I think it was page 311 or 312 of my father's book. There's a section there, the title of it in the section is utilities lead stocks. And the argument was there that utilities tend to move in advance of major regime changes in the stock market. Now my father never had the sophistication of testing in the way that I did. But I said, OK, that's interesting. I started doing a little research into it. Martin Pring, well-known technician, references utilities, John Murphy. So I started testing utilities as a leading indicator for equity volatility, which ended up being the premise for the 2014 Dow award paper that I'm known for, an inter-market approach to beta rotation. So if utilities are a leading indicator of risk, well, then let's create a strategy around that. And that was sort of the initial idea. I then added the confirming relationship of treasuries, because usually when treasuries are strong, yields are dropping, utilities outperform. So I actually did this in an SMA format, in terms of just running it for clients, and then launched a mutual fund. Now the nature of the strategies that I'm known for is that you lag on the upside to lead on the downside, meaning you underperform, you up capture is less than 100%, you keep getting whipped around playing defense, slowing down, entering a storm, never having an accident. And then the accident finally occurs. But because you slow down, you don't actually get hurt too much, or actually you benefit from it and avoid it. Now I launched the mutual fund 2012. I had built a nice name at the time, because I was in the media all the time. I was on CBC. I was one of Mark I Watch's top writers. I launched the fund with zero assets, got to 100 plus million in four months with no seed investors, just people knowing that I was live with this strategy. And yeah, I built the name in 2011, 2012, because there was high volatility. You had a summer crash in 2011. You had the Euro, the pigs, the debt downgrade 2012. You had two definable corrections where I can still point to writings that are dated, available on Mark I Watch, where prior to those corrections in 2012, I said conditions favor a stock market correction, conditions favored risk off. Now I launched the mutual fund 2012. Here comes QE3, quantitative easing three. Here comes one of the smoothest bull markets in history. And I'm risk on risk off in a pure risk on world. So I keep lagging. You know, if you have an approach that thrives on the downside, that thrives on down capture, you got to be in an environment where there's downside to capture. You need the right cycle. You need the sequence of returns to favor your approach. Well if you're risk on risk off in a pure risk on world, you're about as effective as a one legged man in an ass kicking contest, because you're only playing one side of it. So that's the error part of the equation. I happened to launch this very specific type of strategy in the worst cycle you can imagine. Pure risk on with a risk on risk off world. Thankfully, I had the right type of early investors to stay in. Thankfully, I had a few of these risk off junctures last year with the real war story with COVID with how the mutual fund behaved. But the broader point here is that, you know, that's why I always use this line on Twitter. There are no gurus in our business. There are only cycles. There are no gurus in this business. There are only cycles. Some people have seen me, saw me as a guru last year with how I navigated the COVID crash being in treasuries prior to it happening, being in equities, you know, pretty much a week after the low. It had nothing to do with me. I was giving voice to math, but the cycle allowed me to give that voice to math and for that voice to be accurate. And I think that's sort of a very underappreciated aspect when it comes to this business that people don't realize. The cycle is everything, pulls everything, pulls everything.","The discussion revolves around the launch of the ATAC rotation fund in 2012 and the strategies used to manage risk. The premise of the fund was based on utilities leading stocks and a correlation between utilities and treasuries as leading indicators for equity volatility. The strategy focuses on downside risk mitigation rather than upside capture, which was discovered through testing different trading strategies. The fund's approach lags on the upside but leads on the downside to avoid losses. However, the launch occurred during a pure risk-on environment, which made it difficult to achieve success. Despite this challenge, the fund gained assets quickly and proved effective during the COVID-19 crash in 2020. The discussion emphasizes the importance of cycles in the finance industry and the need to adapt strategies accordingly."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7THgm-phQc_sep_1350_1595,T7THgm-phQc_sep_1350_1595,"in a good market to make up for it when the market goes down. It always, I think that that's logical. My father similarly has a phrase, to win is not to lose, that he shares with clients, both institutional and individual. But that bucks convention. I mean, the conventional wisdom says, you've got to be in there, you've got to weather the storm, and history will take care of itself. You use a metaphor that it's like driving, and you can look for certain signs of danger. Yeah. Admittedly, this is a very hard business because FOMO is real. Fear of missing out is a very real phenomenon. Don't discount how important that is. The reason why it's a hard phenomenon to deal with, to focus on downside when everybody's making money on the upside, is because rejection hurts physically. This is great study that was done in 04. The title of it is Why Rejection Hurts? It's a psychology study. It was this very simple lab test that was done. Brought in a bunch of participants, they had them sit down in front of a computer. Every single one of these participants was told, you're going to play this online game, like Pong, where you're going to play against two other online players. The game is very simple. Everyone's just going to throw this ball to each other online, to this game. It's like Pong. They've got all these sick cathodes or whatever it is that they connect the brain to monitor brain activity during this game. Now, of course, it's not two other real players, it's a computer simulation. The person sitting there is made to believe that he's playing with two other real people. They've got all these things connected to the brain, checking activity. For the first 10 minutes, it's very boring. The ball is being thrown across everybody. The participant in the experiment is just like, what the hell am I doing here? Then after about five, 10 minutes, suddenly the other two players only throw the ball to each other. Now the person's excluded from the game online. They're monitoring brain activity. The part of the brain that gets activated, as I recall, is the anterior cingulate cortex during that period of rejection, of no longer being a part of this game, which is actually the part of the brain that registers physical pain. So the point of the psychology study was that exclusion from a group, your body actually registers it like you're physically in pain. It's not just emotional, there's actual physical component to it, which kind of makes sense even from sort of an ancestral perspective, because if you were not part of the group as a caveman, you're probably going to get trampled on and killed by the willy maff. You're better in a group than individually. So there's almost an evolutionary aspect to it. And but that also perfectly explains fear of missing out in FOMO and crowd behavior, which and because markets tend to go up more often than not, it's actually hard physically. It's painful to counter the crowd, to not want to participate on the upside because risks are there. You want to go as fast as ever. Even when you're driving, think about it, you're driving and it's raining. If everyone's going at speed limit, you're going to kind of feel like you should go to the speed limit. I mean, you're going to think about slowing down because everyone else is speeding up. Right. So my point is that it's we are hardwired to herd. And herding makes it very hard to think about risk. That's really kind of the main point of that analogy. So how do you how do you resolve that? So, you know, the reality is, unfortunately, most people fix the roof after it rains. They manage risk after the fact. All the indicators that are known for show that there are there are conditions you can identify that favor the accident. And all I advocate is that you slow down entering the storm when the storm is there. Doesn't mean you have to have an accident. Doesn't mean you have to have a crash in the stock market. But if conditions are high for potential tail events, what's wrong with just decelerating your risk, your risk?","The discussion touches on the importance of managing risk in finance, particularly in relation to the fear of missing out (FOMO) and herd behavior. The speaker mentions a psychology study that shows how exclusion from a group can cause physical pain, which can help explain why people have a hard time going against the crowd when everyone is making money in the market. The analogy of driving in the rain is used to illustrate how we are hardwired to herd and how herding behavior can make it difficult to think about risk. The speaker advocates for slowing down and managing risk before a potential market crash, rather than waiting to fix the roof after it rains."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7THgm-phQc_sep_1597_1927,T7THgm-phQc_sep_1597_1927,"Michael, you came out of the gate really strong, 100 million in the first four months, but then it was a tough seven years where it's just you're in a bull market. And I think using your analogy, most people think it's more fun to drive fast than to drive slow. They don't want to be cautious when they don't need to be. What did that look like for your fund? Like how low did it get? And how is it that you, as a fund manager, how do you know to keep at it and to keep going? Yeah, so this is sort of an interesting aspect of society and short-termism, which is to say that the AUM for my mutual fund has always been a love of the place. And I've always had this belief that, and I think this is largely true, that volatility in assets when you're to market daily in a public fund or an ETF, that the volatility of your assets is probably higher than the volatility of your performance. That people will sell or buy for any number of reasons and they panic out because people are increasingly short-term, they refuse to actually hold onto any investment. Say that's a joke about buying hold. buying hold works because very few actually hold. If you consider buying hold like an anomaly, why is it that anomaly has not been arbitraged away? Because that's the joke about buying hold. Nobody holds. So how is it arbitraged away if everyone's so short-term? So I go from launching with nothing to 100 plus million, back down to 90, back up to 110, down to 60, back up to 100, all the way down to, I think it was 58, to, as we speak, around 250, 260. How do you know, and it's kind of an interesting kind of thought experiment, how do you know if it's some cost fallacy? I mean, that you've put all this time, capital in your business and you're holding on simply because you put all that time and capital into it. How do you know it's that or how do you know it's the bottom in your strategy, in your approach? And I always like to think about that as a thought experiment because you don't know except with hindsight. It's a very fine line between knowing what's some cost fallacy and what's selling the low when it comes to anything in life, not just business and investing, but just anything in life. So for me, it was very clear. I was, one, I was very stubborn with it. I said to myself, you know what? I launched this. I know the history of this. I know what I tested. I know my signals. I know the cycle will come my way. I did not think that six, seven years into it, the Fed would just suppress volatility as long as it did, resulting in very momentary blips of volatility and then just back up into the right pure passive, pure beta in a very active strategy. And last year was kind of my vindication, right? Because again, COVID comes out and extremely- It's like a global pandemic for you to be vindicated. Yeah, which is a strange concept, but it's funny because it happened to a lot of different people. You know, it's even, I think you can argue even with ARC, with Cathie Woods, it's the same dynamic, right? It's kind of languished for a while and then pandemic comes and everybody wants gig economy, work for home, you know, innovation stocks, right? But again, it goes back to cycles, not grooves, right? That's kind of my point there. But you know, the only way out of a cycle is through it. The only way is to just- but that's very hard, admittedly, right? Because I could be sitting here and still be in the same situation, right? I mean, it could have, maybe there'd be no pandemic and maybe the fund would work, maybe not. But this is always the hardest battle for any entrepreneur is knowing if you should call it quits, not when to call quits, if you should call quits. Because if you really do believe in what you're doing and if you have real validity and you're not blinded by your own convictions, which is always the hard part. Did you have moments of doubt? Oh, tremendous, of course. Even Mother Teresa had moments of doubt. If you look at her writings on faith, doubt is a necessary precondition for anything to work. Because if something were hard, if something is hard and it creates doubt, there must be opportunity because only some people will stick through the doubt and see it to the end. But even in the context of markets, if we kind of think about it as a thought experiment, anomalies get arbitraged away when there's no doubt that you can take advantage of the anomaly in terms of just sort of efficient markets. But if an anomaly has periods where you seemingly can't arbitrage it, there's doubt that the anomaly even exists, like the anomaly that there are these leading indicators of volatility, well that doubt means that certain people that might be tracking those indicators, those relationships, they no longer track it because they say it's broken, it's not going to work again. So what happens to the anomaly? It has to get bigger. The anomaly has to persist because of doubt. And even in the context of business, my argument would be that don't be afraid of your own doubt about what you're doing as long as it's based on something that's real. I'm not advocating that you be reckless and you stay in something too long if there's not real merit to it, but doubt is natural. I mean, it's not supposed to be easy. You can't get the gold without the dragon. You've got to go through the battles. You've got to go through the doubt and you've got to fight through it. You've got to not have that balance from a work-life perspective because if you believe in what you're doing, the cycle at some point will come your way. You just got to stick around long enough.","Michael, a fund manager, talks about the short-termism of society and how it affects the assets under management (AUM) of his mutual fund. He believes that volatility in assets when you're to market daily in a public fund or an ETF is probably higher than the volatility of your performance. People will sell or buy for any number of reasons, and they panic out because they are increasingly short-term. He explains that buying and holding works because very few actually hold. This makes it difficult to know if the decision to keep going with a fund or a business is a result of the sunk cost fallacy or if it's the bottom in the strategy. Michael talks about how he dealt with doubts and how doubt is a necessary precondition for anything to work. He believes that you shouldn't be afraid of your own doubt about what you're doing as long as it's based on something that's real."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7THgm-phQc_sep_1929_2017,T7THgm-phQc_sep_1929_2017,"it and when to persevere? That is the biggest question of all. And partially, I think it depends on the domain you're playing with. So some domains, some industries as a business owner, there's a clearer link between effort and output. So whereas in our industry, in the investment field, it's not clear the harder you work if you're going to get better returns or you're going to get more assets. So the link is a little bit harder there. And in many ways, when the link is harder there between effort and output, that's when you probably want to stick to it longer because maybe luck comes your way outside of your own effort. You can control your effort, but you can't control your output. Some other domains, however, it's a much clearer link. Some other professions, much clearer link. If your output from a broad perspective, if your work ethic is not resulting in the desired results in that profession, and if in general that profession has a high correlation between effort and output and it's not working, that's probably where you would pivot. My argument would be that you don't want to pivot when the link is not that clear because you may be pivoting the moment that the error in that equation turns your way. Well, Michael, to your credit, you did persevere. So now you look at your one year, three year, five year track record. Your concept is...","The discussion revolves around the question of when to persevere in business, specifically in the finance industry. The speaker argues that the link between effort and output is not always clear in the investment field, making it harder to know when to persevere or pivot. They suggest that in industries with a clearer link between effort and output, it may be better to pivot if your work ethic is not resulting in the desired results. However, in domains where the link is not clear, it may be better to stick with it longer because luck can play a role in the outcome. The conversation ends with praise for Michael's perseverance and success in the industry."

Last year was probably one of the hardest years that you actually had to pound the pavement and work. So what did that look like? Yeah, no, I mean, it's exactly right. As somebody once said to me, you must be floating on cloud nine in the midst of everything kind of correcting and rebounding, because I was the top performing mutual fund in every asset class, because nobody else really goes fully treasuries or fully equities in the way that the ATF Rotation Mutual Fund does, or the new Roto ETF, or the junk on junk off Jojo ETF. But yeah, I think the one thing is to think about the pivot and the doubt and the perseverance. But in many ways, the harder thing is staying on top. The thing that drove me, even though performance was speaking for itself at that time in terms of the business, the thing that drove me was my fear of not quite getting past escape velocity, which everyone has felt at some point in their lives. Meaning, you have this, you have a taste of success, everything that you worked so hard for, it's finally playing out. But you feel still a little on edge, because what if you're just on the edge of escape velocity and you go right back down to Earth? So I had to kind of push myself to trying to really get above that escape velocity. So what was the first thing I did? Two months into my move to Toroso, bringing the Mutual Fund over, I said, OK, time to launch another fund. Time to launch now a suite of funds, the Roto ETF, use as long gold as the trigger, the Jojo junk on junk on bond ETF. I actually put on more work on myself. But that's what you have to do. And again, if you're an entrepreneur, you never stop building. You never want to stop. It's in your DNA. You have one strategy that works great. Time to launch another strategy. This is how you diversify. This is how you really build a big business. And this is, at the end of the day, it goes back to, if you want to really make it in anything in life, you have to take a concentrated bet on what you're doing. A concentrated bet has to go beyond a particular strategy. It has to go to a way of thinking and then applying that way of thinking in multiple different vehicles to monetize off of. That goes to Lee Lagerport, that goes to Roro, Jojo, ATAX, and anything else that I launched. Even the app I'm running, which I'm relaunching in September, How You Dish. Everything for me is just trying to apply that entrepreneurial energy into multiple diversified lottery tickets. I see that there's the common thread of risk on risk off. It makes a lot of sense that you're diversifying strategies and products. With the launch of Roro as the ETF, why did you shift from mutual fund to an ETF vehicle? So a couple of things. First of all, Toroso, which the advisor that I'm under, were known as ETF specialists. So it kind of makes sense. And I think arguably the mutual fund structure stays our numbered. I think it's going to take longer than most people think in terms of ETFs replacing mutual funds. But the writing is on the wall, I think, largely on that. And in the case of the signals and the strategies that I run, it's hyperactive. So the anomaly that these leading indicators to volatility and tail risk, the anomaly only really lives in the short term, which means you have to keep on slowing down entering the storm often, which means you have to have a lot of activity in your trading as a fund, which has tax implications. So mutual funds have to pay out at the end of the year, their short term capital gains that are done from the trading and the turnover of mutual funds over 1000 percent. So the ETF structure arguably is a better one for something that's active in this way. But then the question is, well, why go not just from ETF, but also why change the signal and the strategy? Well, because why not? Right. So I view there are these five different white papers that won these five different awards. All of them document different signals. Typically, all the signals line up in the same way in advance of a major crash correction bear market, meaning prior to a major tail events, everything kind of flashes a warning sign in between is where there are differences. So just like somebody has a diversified beta suite of different types of equities, why not have a diversified risk on risk off suite of different types of signals where the correlation to the strategies is low. They're diversified to each other, all with the same end goal of trying to protect on the downside. So Roro uses the relationship of lumber to gold. This happens to be an interesting year for that because lumber has been in the media quite a bit, having gone vertical and completely crashed. The Jojo ETF is my first bond fund, which uses utilities as the trigger. The idea there is that utilities are the most bond like sector of the stock market. Junk debt is the most equity like a portion of the bond market. So why not play with credit quality as a risk on risk off bond strategy? And hopefully I'll have some other products down the line, but I'm trying to be innovative in the space. The reality is, and you know this, having looked at tons of different funds yourself, most funds are just different takes on beta. They're just playing off the same risk factors. They sound great. They look great. They have what seems like a unique strategy, but they all kind of co-move very similarly. You can't really raise assets that way in any that way in any that way in any.","The discussion is about the challenges of maintaining success in the finance industry, particularly in managing investment funds. The speaker, a fund manager, shares his experience of being the top-performing mutual fund in every asset class, and the fear of not being able to maintain that success. He explains how he diversified his offerings by launching other funds and products, such as ETFs, and the importance of taking a concentrated bet on one's strategies. He also explains why he shifted from mutual fund to an ETF vehicle, and how he diversified his risk on risk off strategies by launching different products with low correlations to each other. The goal is to protect on the downside and be innovative in the industry, which is often filled with funds that are just different takes on beta."

I'm trying to do something different by being the most active manager you can imagine, which when it works really stands out like last year in a good way. When it doesn't work, it also stands out in a really bad way. But I have to take risk from a business perspective, which means I have a strategy which is very different than everything else that's out there. In the ETF, if you go from, and you'll have to refresh my memory with Roro, is it small cap US? If you're going long equities and then it's risk off and you go 100% in treasuries, there's no tax implication to the owner? Right, so the way that it works within the ETF structure without getting too wonky is there's what's called a heartbeat trade, which basically means you're exchanging this existing holdings and resetting the cost basis internally in the ETF. Is that why ETFs are tax evisualtions? So we can do these rotations without the short-term capital gains distribution that the mutual fund otherwise has to deal with. The lumber to gold signal is interesting because the link is around housing, right? Most people's homes have about 16,000 board feet of lumber. So lumber is a very key telling housing, which is a key telling consumer wealth. So as lumber performs, it means risk on better environment for growth inflation. As lumber is weak, it's the opposite. Now you have not had a risk off period just yet here sitting in 2021. Key word is yet. But just because you slow down entering the storm doesn't mean you're still not getting to your destination. I mean, so I played risk off a couple of times this year and there've been no volatility spikes, no corrections. That's okay. Still making money in those funds because treasuries have still benefited from this disinflation scare that I think is happening. And that's an important point too when it comes to this business of investing. Ideally, you wanna have an opportunity set that allows you to be wrong and still make money. Error, that's luck, right? Treasuries have some of that error that allow you to play defense without necessarily making a directional bet. And in case your directional bet is wrong, you might still have made money during that waiting game. Since you've been looking at lumber for a long time, what is your reaction to lumber prices this year? Has it played into what you've seen historically or has the movement just been so volatile that it actually made you think or worry and say, is my signal gonna work? Yeah. So I love this question because, first of all, when you follow a rules-based signal, you have to be very careful not to editorialize it too much. Right, because the moment you do that, now you're introducing a human element of, well, maybe this time is different. Maybe I shouldn't follow this specific signal. So you're gonna follow something you follow no matter what the extenuating circumstances are. You can't make exceptions. Now, having said that, lumber has cratered since early May, which would suggest risk off. Risk off being defined as conditions favoring higher stock market volatility. Now, some of the advance obviously is due to sawmills having closed down and obviously the double whammy of a big pickup in demand. Sawmills came on, but that doesn't explain the complete collapse that's happened since early May. So I think there's more to it than that. But to your point, I have a lot of people on Twitter throughout the lead lag report, my handle saying, well, it's a one-off. How do you, exactly your question, how do you know it's gonna be a true signal? I don't. But I'll tell you something that's interesting. The behavior of lumber here is actually very consistent with other parts of the marketplace. So one of the dynamics so far in the first six months of the year has been small caps really since early February have gone nowhere. Now, small caps as a part of the marketplace are very domestically tied. More of the revenue of smaller companies is tied to the US economy than multinational large caps. Just because of the size aspect of it. Usually when lumber is strong, small caps outperform large caps. Because lumber is a talent housing, housing is a talent domestic consumer. Small caps are the biggest beneficiary of that. Well, when lumber is weak, small caps underperform large caps. Last I checked, yeah, large caps in the SMB are making new highs as we speak, you know, on the 23rd here of July. But small caps are not, they've gone nowhere. So my point is that yes, lumber has not yet suggested risk off, but behaviorally a lot of the other parts of the marketplace are acting as you would expect. Small cap weakness, yields dropping, dollar strength, all that is consistent with the idea that credit is coming out of the system through the mechanism perhaps of housing slowing down and the deceleration of credit creation from that. So it's always more nuanced than just sort of the outcome. I always make this point that, you know, system one thinking, reactionary thinking is to look at what's happening after the equal sign. System two thinking is looking at what's happening before the equal sign. What's happening in terms of other parts of the marketplace getting you to that conclusion.","The discussion touches on various aspects of finance, including the importance of standing out in the industry by taking risks and having a unique strategy. The conversation also delves into ETFs and their tax implications, as well as the use of lumber as a signal for consumer wealth and risk-on environments. The discussion emphasizes the importance of following rules-based signals and avoiding editorializing them too much. Finally, the conversation highlights the nuances involved in analyzing market behavior and making investment decisions based on those observations."
,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7THgm-phQc_sep_2640_2916,T7THgm-phQc_sep_2640_2916,"Well, I like your strategies because I think given the current environment, investors are seeking assets other than bonds, and they're trying to figure out what kind of bond substitutes when you have a low interest rate can you own that can serve as your insurance in case there's an accident ahead, and how do you dampen some of that potentially? I know that you spend a lot of time also looking at alternative assets like cryptocurrencies and blockchain. How do you think that that fits into somebody's portfolio? So I've always made this point that, look, I think increasingly you have to have diversification through not just asset class with strategies and through different technologies as well, which Bitcoin fits under and blockchain certainly fits under. In Toroso, we run the largest blockchain ETF out there. So take it for what it's worth. I have an incentive to talk up blockchain. I don't have an incentive, though, to talk up Bitcoin as a situation where it's all or none in a portfolio. I'm very much a believer that nobody can predict the future. I have no idea if fiat is going to be around in 100 years. I have no idea if Bitcoin is going to be around in 100 years. Neither do the maximalists. Nobody knows what the future holds. So I think that's a good point. But I'm not up with this certainty that you can predict what's further on time. The profession that has the most accuracy of predicting the future are weathermen. This has been shown a lot of studies of all the domains. The one that's most accurate at predicting the future are weathermen. But the caveat is only three days out in a 10-day forecast. It's not my opinion. These are facts. So I always take issue with anybody that says something so confidently about the future because, how do you possibly know? It's hubris down a peg. So what that means is that you've got to have exposure to it, though, because even the doubters, it makes sense to have a small allocation to as many different things as possible. That includes Bitcoin, gold, that includes anything that's blockchain related, that includes anything that's risk on, risk off. Have as much exposure to as many different investments because you don't know what future path is going to play out. Now the challenge, of course, is always the waiting. That's a whole different discussion. I'm always an advocate that you want as much exposure to as many different things as possible, as long as it makes sense. Just don't be overly convinced in any single one thing working because, again, the moment you do that, you might be right, but then you're becoming somebody that you really shouldn't be, which is a Nostradamus to an unknowable future path. Well, I think I find crypto kind of interesting because you have big banks, you have guys like Jamie Dimon saying that you should not own Bitcoin, even though he acknowledges that his clients want it. On the other hand, I think that there are a lot of retail investors who they're going to have a tendency, because of the price movement, when it goes up, it goes up at a quick clip. I think there's a tendency for people to want to own too much. So do you have an opinion on that waiting? What makes sense for the average person? It's got to be something that has some potential to move the needle, but not too much. And obviously, I tend to look at things kind of probably similar to you as a barbell approach. You want to put a small allocation to highly volatile speculative investments and a large allocation to more conservative, low volatile investments. Because Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are so extraordinarily volatile, you probably want to have a smaller allocation than bonds. Even the bonds that have their own risks, the volatility and drawdown will be less. But you're actually hitting on something which is also proven out in a lot of different studies. So people get more convinced of their investments when it goes up. So they take on more risk, actually, when it goes up. Most people don't rebalance back to a target allocation, even though time and time again, studies have shown that rebalancing is really how you actually outperform over very long periods. You sell that which is strong relative to something else which is weak and get back to your allocation numbers. That always makes sense, independent of what asset class you're using. That's an anomaly that also exists because very few people actually take advantage of it. So I think somewhere in that maybe 1%, 3%, 5% range, I don't know, more than that seems a little extreme given the volatility dynamics. Again, I think it makes sense to have as much exposure to as many different things. Be humble whenever you look at it.","The discussion is about diversification in investments, particularly in the current environment where investors are seeking assets other than bonds. The speaker suggests having exposure to different asset classes, strategies, and technologies, including cryptocurrencies and blockchain. However, they caution against being overly convinced in any single investment and recommend a barbell approach with a small allocation to highly volatile speculative investments and a large allocation to more conservative, low volatile investments. They also suggest rebalancing back to a target allocation and being humble when looking at investments, as nobody can predict the future."

I like to ask all the inspired money guests. How do you define success? Can I say being on the show? Can I say that? Is that a good answer? No, that's a cop out. Yeah, I know. I know. I don't think you can. I think everybody's definition of success is different. To me, I think success is best defined as an outcome where you don't regret. To me, success is more about regret than anything else. If you feel that you're successful, you're not going to regret going through the hard times. You're not going to regret because you got to where you wanted to go. You'll have survived the pain. You went through the struggle and in the moment, it really feels awful. Then when you're successful, you certainly realize that, okay, well, all that was worth it. All that pain was worth it. All that suffering, all the going through the desert was worth the time and the struggle. It's more sort of a taking out of the negative with hindsight, I think. Again, success is defined in a lot of different ways. I don't view it necessarily as money, as size of your company, as anything except literally just that. If you don't regret what you've done, I think you're successful. As a fund manager, what does Cloud9 look like? The more balance I have in my strategies, meaning in terms of just assets, the better. I've got the ATAC fund family. The mutual fund was the first one. I launched the Roro ETF, the Jojo ETF. For me, I want to see every single fund have the same types of asset growth, meaning equal, roughly, because it's like diversification of my own personal income. I don't want to have the concentration risk. You have to be concentrated as an entrepreneur to some extent. You've got to be all in, which goes back to the work-life balance. You've got to put the effort in. You've got to take a very specific bet, which also, by the way, how you go fail. To be successful, arguably, in that domain, the entrepreneurial domain, you have to be very concentrated. At some point, you have to transition away from the concentration. That transition from the concentration, at least in the fund world, means having other funds which are all trying to get to the same place but are balanced in terms of the types of investors, the AUM, so that if one's not working and the volatility of assets goes down, like I've experienced with the mutual fund, Roro or Jojo end up picking it back up. I get a smoother cash flow stream. That, to me, is Cloud9. That's what I'm really aiming for. Yeah, diversification. Well, thank you, Michael.
